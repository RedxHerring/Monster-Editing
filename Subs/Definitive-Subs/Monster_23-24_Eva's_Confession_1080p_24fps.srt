1
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,144
You wake up

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,728
Leave me alone

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,032
Yeah like that's going to happen

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,568
Now get up

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,408
We can still do this the easy way come on this isn't a hotel

6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Don't touch me

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
How dare you

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,392
Do you have any idea who I am

9
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
All right

10
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,760
Here's all the stuff you came in with

11
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
If everything's in order you can sign here

12
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Ms Heineman

13
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,024
I don't ever want to see you tossed in the cooler again

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,400
Passing out drunk alone in the dark alley be thankful something horrible didn't happen to you

15
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
You got a cigarette

16
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
I'm just asking if you've got a cigarette

17
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,992
There's no smoking in the station go outside if you want to smoke

18
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Later

19
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
Where is my lighter

20
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
My bag

21
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
I want to know what you did with my bag

22
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,208
And I already told you it's the only bag you had

23
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,560
You liar I know you're not telling me the truth I had another shoulder bag where is it

24
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
Probably with whoever stole it from you when you passed out drunk in the all

25
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,984
What are you going to do about it I have valuables important things in there

26
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
I tell you what

27
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,336
You can fill out a theft report if you like

28
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
But I really wouldn't get your hopes up

29
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
How the hell did you lose your key

30
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,952
My bag was still in last night just hurry up and open the room for me

31
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
What what happened here

32
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
Somebody really want to town

33
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,080
Oh man this is awful

34
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,872
I got to change the lock now

35
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,456
Which reminds me Miss Heineman you still owe me back rent

36
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
I don't want to have to ask you again the deposit you put down is already run out I'm going to need the rest of what you

37
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,488
These people even broke into my damn suitcase are you listening

38
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
You have to pay for a new lock and all that back rent

39
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
Well I don't have any money

40
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
What

41
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
Fine I'll get out don't worry

42
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
You're such a tragic story still I don't know what you expect me to do about

43
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
Any of it you know I seem to remember you being the one who storm that on me oh come on that's

44
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,903
Ancient history now so I know buy me a drink

45
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
It's just a stolen purse for God's sake you must have had some extra cash checked away somewhere

46
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
Honestly have yet to meet another woman who could burn through money the way you do and here you are finally coming to me for

47
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,847
This is it welcome to Rock Bottom baby

48
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
I'll sleep with you you know

49
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063
I'm asking you how much you'd be willing to pay honey as

50
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,183
General rule most men won't pay to have sex with women they've already had a bunch of times

51
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
You can at least buy me a drink you'll find yourself a street corner to work who

52
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
She might get lucky and meet some Sad Sack is not too picky desperate and middle-aged and drunk must be someone's type

53
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
Yeah I'm positive you didn't leave any

54
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,319
Papers here last night maybe you left it wherever you went next

55
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,951
I don't remember anything after I left this ball

56
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,279
If it's worth any money you might as well Kiss It Goodbye

57
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,631
No it's not it's not worth anything at all

58
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
Not any money that is

59
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Hey

60
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
I've been looking for you

61
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
I asked for you at the pub back there

62
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,343
And they told me you just headed in this direction

63
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
Yeah and who are you

64
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Are you serious

65
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
We had such a good time drinking last night

66
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
I was drinking with you

67
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Your bag

68
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
That's why I was looking for you

69
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
I guess this means I have to make

70
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
Awkward introductions again

71
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
I'm Roberto

72
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,407
So should we grab a little something to eat

73
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Your hotel room

74
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Really

75
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,343
That's terrible I'm so sorry I mean it's not like you did it

76
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Well no obviously not

77
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
I didn't even dare look in your back

78
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,255
Oh look my hotel keys are still in here

79
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
A little late for those

80
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
I don't need them anymore

81
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
I'm sorry it's all my fault

82
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,263
If I'd return your bag sooner you wouldn't have been kicked out of your room in the first place

83
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,871
Besides I'm very grateful that you gave me back my back

84
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,455
Honestly I'm kind of grateful that you lost it

85
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,575
Well last night as I watched you leave the pub I sat there thinking to myself

86
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
You shouldn't let this person slip away

87
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
And now thanks to your bag

88
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
Here you are and here I am

89
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
You have something very important in there don't you

90
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
I do

91
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
This is all that I have left in the world

92
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
A photo album

93
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
May I take a look

94
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
That's my father

95
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
He looks just like I imagine

96
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,903
He was a hospital director right

97
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
Yeah did I talk about him last night

98
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
You did you spoke very highly of

99
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
You mentioned that he died 10 years ago

100
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
I could tell that you still miss him

101
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
Let's see

102
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
The ex-fiance

103
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,847
Please don't tell me I told you about him

104
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
I believe his name was Tem

105
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Quite a guy

106
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
This Tenma

107
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
I really want to know what I said last night

108
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
Well I wouldn't make a habit of it

109
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
It might end up making other men jealous

110
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
On this page is empty

111
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Is that so

112
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,959
The photos that were on this page looks like somebody tore them out

113
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,287
Well I guess I didn't need those pictures anymore

114
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
So I see

115
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
Hey

116
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Let's get a drink

117
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Sounds good

118
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
So you were running a security company

119
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
I'm impressed yeah

120
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
In the south of France

121
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,703
Then we had a bad day and one of our better clients was killed on my watch

122
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
So that was the end of that

123
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
We're both going through tough times forget it let's drink to the hearing now enjoy yourself

124
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
You know

125
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
It's good stuff huh

126
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
So you like this song too

127
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Of course

128
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Let's Dance

129
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,871
Come on

130
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:30,271
I don't really know how to dance

131
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,879
God

132
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
I know a man who love this song he wasn't a very good dancer either

133
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
So you'd end up dancing like this

134
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
That's right

135
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:54,335
How fun

136
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
How about another drink

137
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
Just one more

138
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
Thanks but I'm good

139
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
Lightweight

140
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Time for bed

141
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
Sounds good to me babe

142
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
There's just one more thing

143
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
What's that

144
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Pictures

145
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Where are they

146
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
What pictures

147
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,527
Stop playing stuff

148
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,855
Those photographs you took out of the album

149
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:44,255
Where'd you hide them tell me see I'm

150
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
Your little secret you're looking for Tenma aren't you

151
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:57,055
I know you get those photos from burning and I'm sure you have them with you somewhere

152
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
Know where 10 -

153
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,855
Photographs that you're talking about

154
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,439
May the ones with father in that boy am I right

155
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
Wasn't it

156
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
Him you know blonde Charming handsome he's grown up well I

157
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,335
A year ago and Dusseldorf

158
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,711
So

159
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
What are you up to these days

160
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
I've heard all sorts of rumors

161
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
The rumors are probably true

162
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
I've been married and divorced three times now

163
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,303
Between my father's inheritance and my alimony I'm living pretty comfortably

164
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,399
But enough about me how is life been treating you Dr Becker

165
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
I don't know

166
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:00,031
Well nothing's changed with me I still have no chance of moving up in the world

167
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,847
Speaking of which 10 must now chief of surgery

168
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663
Where it is he's on his way to becoming Hospital director

169
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
Love to be in his shoes let me tell you

170
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:14,367
But please who am I kidding it ain't so bad I still managed to have a good time there's more to life

171
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,231
Promotions I never want to be like 10 men have no time for women or fun what's the point

172
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
Is Kenzo

173
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,655
Do you know by any chance if Dr Tenma ever did settle down

174
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
No not yet and to be completely honest I've introduced him to quite a few very nice women but you know him no

175
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
No interest at all his work comes first

176
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,991
As a matter of fact I'm about to set him up with a new girl God only knows if it's going to work out

177
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
She's the daughter of a state senator and she is absolutely beautiful if she can't keep his attention that

178
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
I give up

179
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,279
Anyway you called me about something how can I be of service Ava

180
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
You know

181
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,911
Back when you were the daughter of the hospital director you never even gave me the time of day

182
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
Who would have thought that you'd even think to call

183
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
I understand you're well off

184
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
But really

185
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
I think you're getting lonely aren't you

186
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,735
I mean it when I say it Eva I'm more than happy to listen anytime

187
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
Look I don't want you to let them meet up

188
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,159
Dr tenman the state senators daughter

189
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
Don't let him meet her

190
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
Man I should have known

191
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
You're still in love with him

192
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Don't let him

193
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:02,655
Do me a favor don't screw it up this time I went out of my way to set this one up for you Tim

194
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,239
Well we'll see about that

195
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,991
This is it this is the clock that Mr Yonkers was talking about at the hospital

196
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
Excuse me about the clock what's going on what what are you doing

197
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,623
That's a very beautiful watch

198
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Why thank you

199
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,023
I mean I wear a watch but mine is nothing a trinket

200
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,351
Honestly I don't even check the time anymore

201
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
I wonder why

202
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,727
Time seems to be moving faster and faster

203
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,567
Excuse me but who are you

204
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,943
I'm sorry I don't mean to be rude but are you Senator Burgers daughter Angelica

205
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Goodness

206
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:27,135
You're a pretty little thing well aren't you thank you I think

207
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,999
And you're convinced that the entire world revolves around you am I right

208
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:39,423
Going through life thinking that there's nothing you can't have it must be very pleasant

209
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,823
I'm sorry what are you trying to say I'm confused who are you exactly

210
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,407
I have this tiny little birthmark on my inner thigh

211
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
He used to kiss it

212
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,343
How he used to love kissing me there

213
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
Dr Tena that is

214
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
You know him

215
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Oh no

216
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,847
See see she left because you were late and it's all because you had to stop in that store

217
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
Oh too bad

218
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
I'm sorry about that

219
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,247
Can you do me a favor and apologize for me

220
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
Hey timer

221
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
Maybe if you give her a call right now she might come back

222
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:46,239
I want to stop by the hospital for a quick minute what at this hour

223
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:52,639
I've had it with you fine leave

224
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Enzo

225
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
You're mine

226
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
You're all mine

227
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431
Mr Yonkers

228
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,967
Please wait

229
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,367
Mr Yonkers

230
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
Kenzo

231
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
What's going on

232
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:54,079
Mr Yonkers

233
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,607
Cancel

234
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,671
Oh great I broke my heel

235
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,871
Cancel

236
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:25,471
Cancel

237
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,871
I saw him you know oh yes a year ago

238
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:09,503
Dusseldorf I saw him it was Johann I'm sure of it

239
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
He saw you on Guess

240
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:45,856
I have to kill you

241
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,752
Yes I've seen something that I wasn't supposed to see

242
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:07,872
I'm thinking it was that sweet looking blonde boy I saw in Dusseldorf a year ago

243
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,736
Because I've seen Johann this is how it ends up that's how it works with you

244
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,392
It was dark and raining when I heard those three gunshots

245
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,208
I was there alone and got scared so I ran away

246
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,304
At the time I was pretty certain it was tedma who'd been shot dead

247
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
But the next day there was this big article in the newspaper saying that a man named Yonkers had been found dead in the same location

248
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
And that he'd been shot three times

249
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
So then that boy did it didn't

250
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,200
Might want to rethink holding that trigger

251
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,832
If you kill me you'll never get what you really want

252
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,928
That photograph you've been looking for the one of Johann as a young boy

253
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,280
Let me tell you what will happen if you do decide to kill me

254
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,656
If I die I've arranged for that photo you want so much to be delivered directly to the bka

255
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,776
If you want to see that photograph you need to tell me exactly where Tenma can be found

256
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:25,952
Just what is so funny your whole body is quivering

257
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:32,352
You talk tough but your legs are shaking so hard you can barely stand

258
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,752
You really do amuse me

259
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:45,152
I'll tell you where he is still working

260
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:49,504
The doctor but our friend is gone on the ground

261
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,904
How's this older guy in Hanover who was the number two man in a certain organized crime family

262
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
Guys boss kind of freaked out and put out a hit on him but the job got botched the guy got all shut up

263
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,704
But he didn't die September is at this remote Alpine estate patching him up it's up on

264
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,032
Mountain near foosen

265
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,168
Excuse me but why did you just stand there like that

266
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,456
Hey mister it's almost time for lunch

267
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,976
Why in the world are we eating outside

268
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
I just

269
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,328
The weather looks so nice this afternoon

270
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,144
Why not mix up our routine and eat outside

271
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Why have our lunch out here

272
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
Dieter

273
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,520
Go ahead and bring the plates out here

274
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
Okay

275
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
Oh your wounds are healing nicely

276
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,432
And this fresh air will do you good

277
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,272
I have to say doctor

278
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,088
If you hadn't been there I doubt I would have made it

279
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,136
That country Clinic was pathetic

280
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,464
But the masterful skills you possess allowed you to save my life

281
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,096
Maybe the one bullet just grazed your head and the other one went into your leg and passed through cleanly

282
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,656
Just be thankful it didn't catch your femoral artery

283
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
To be honest you are quite lucky

284
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
Lucky huh

285
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:54,432
Alrighty guys lunches served wow that smells good heckle

286
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,344
Surprising isn't it it tast

287
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,744
Delicious Heckle may look more like a pickpocket but he's actually quite the chef don't you agree

288
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
Did you mean by that

289
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
This my friends is chicken Marengo the key to the dish is the sauce you have to get it just right it's based on a recipe

290
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
Keep from a three-star French restaurant called La Petite men

291
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,224
Appreciate the subtleties of fine cuisine you know this would say Steven better with a dash of soy sauce soy sauce

292
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,344
Not that again you put soy sauce on everything thank you this is dining

293
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,440
When you sit down to eat this is how it should be

294
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
What a waste

295
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,352
All my life everything I did was to make money

296
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,704
But while I was earning all those Millions I lost things much more valuable

297
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,544
Both of my parents and my only brother disowned me

298
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,104
Even my wife and son were murdered

299
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,920
I always wanted to live peacefully

300
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,480
Dying like we're doing right now

301
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
Money can really change the way people act

302
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,608
Allow me to share a good example with you

303
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:27,616
5 years ago a covert banking organization was formed to facilitate the underground funds flowing throughout Germany

304
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,944
But these guys pulled off was absolutely amazing

305
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,832
Within days of the Dirty Money flowing in through Shady companies it would come out the other side perfectly clean

306
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,136
A money laundering operation

307
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
Exactly

308
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,512
On top of that this organization functioned in many ways like a real Bank

309
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,096
Making loans and investing in speculative transactions

310
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
And a girl unbelievably fast

311
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,728
In five short years they made a fortune

312
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,384
But that all changed this year because the man who'd been running the show suddenly vanished he hasn't been seen in months and

313
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
Windows where he went

314
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
Guess what happened then

315
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
I fell apart

316
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,856
The entire operation imploded

317
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,000
The associates that remains started fighting over who would get what was left and who would be in charge

318
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
Most of them ended up killing each other

319
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,400
The entire operation disappeared

320
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
If only

321
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:28,032
I've been sensible and talk things out while sharing a fine dinner

322
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,224
You think that guy got murdered or did he just run off

323
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,576
Keep up doc I mean the head honcho guy who disappeared

324
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
So kidnapped murder

325
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
What do you think

326
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,416
I don't know

327
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,976
I'm quite sure he's still alive

328
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,072
In fact he might even be posing as a student somewhere

329
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
A student

330
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
That's right

331
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
I forgot to tell you

332
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,496
I left out something important

333
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:04,896
According to my sources the guy who created that money laundering organization 5 years ago was just a kid

334
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:11,552
15 years old

335
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:17,952
15 years old you sources must be nuts no way it could pull off something

336
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,512
Like that but it's true this kid did it

337
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:25,376
Tenses if he was conducting his own experiment to see how adults deal with money

338
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,984
As though he were a child playing around with a line of ants

339
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,360
Where was all this do you know where this covert banking operation was based

340
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:41,504
The organization was headquartered in Dusseldorf but the kid at the top was constantly on the move

341
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,600
He controlled the entire operation from wherever he was you know

342
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:50,464
And did anybody figure out the last place that he was seen before he disappeared

343
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
I saw the details I know but I heard right after their young boss went missing all of his money hungry underlings went

344
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Washington Munich

345
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,192
Communicate

346
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,264
Hey Doc why the long face what's going on

347
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
I know

348
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:11,200
Let's invite that man down the hell up here for lunch sure why not that's a good idea

349
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,552
Sorry doctor but that means my body God he needs to stay down there

350
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,136
But haven't you been officially declared dead already

351
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,464
You still think there are people out there who want to do you harm

352
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:27,584
Are you planning to live the rest of your life and fear hiding behind a bodyguard

353
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,456
How much has been with me for a very long time indeed

354
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,504

00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
Ask him to join us

359
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,472
Have him come here so we can discuss our future at this table

360
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
Okay

361
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:33,376
Mr Helmut lunch time they want you to come up and join us

362
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,264
Time is right up there in the mountain Villa

363
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,384
You do want to kill him don't you

364
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:59,232
It's something that matter that was a

365
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,632
Unfortunately I

366
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
He's already dead wait someone's coming after you there's no telling but

367
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:18,432
I'd say someone's heading up here even as we speak

368
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
Go tell him

369
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
You have to tell him to run away

370
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,960
Hurry go until 10 minutes now

371
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,264
Tell him damn it

372
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,992
I said go tell him

373
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,320
But your leg you've been shot don't worry about me go

374
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
Hang on

375
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
Who's shooting at us

376
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Did you get him

377
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,680
I'm not sure but now's your chance to run for it get going but I can't go you're out here in the

378
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:50,080
I can handle this just go no you can't go

379
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,104
Time

380
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
Well well

381
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
Looks like I was wrong

382
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,040
She didn't want to kill him after all

383
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,160
You going to be all right man

384
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,464
I'll be fine

385
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
But I think

386
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,304
He's already heading up the hill on his way to the villa

387
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:15,936
Not a chance I would have seen him from here there's really only one path to get all the way up to that house

388
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
What are you talking about

389
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:23,104
I've explored this whole mountain and this path is the only way up there all the other pass lead to Cliffs no one can climb

390
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:29,504
So then if we guard this Trail there's no other way Roberto will be able to get far enough of the mountain to get to the villa

391
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,296
You mean you know this guy

392
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
I know him too well

393
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,160
Roberto's after 10 money he wants to kill him

394
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,000
You know Tenma so who are you ma'am are you a friend of his

395
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:51,776
What you laughing about ma'am don't make me sound so old stop calling me man

396
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
Now get out of here kid

397
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
You get up there until 10

398
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
Tell him to run away quick

399
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,480
But man I mean lady you're bleeding I'll be all right

400
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:04,320
You just get up there and warn him but your leg looks like it's bleeding a lot

401
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,928
10 my mustard those gunshots I bet he's headed down here to take care of that guy

402
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
It's not good

403
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,560
Roberta wants 10 minutes come down here and try to save us so we can kill him

404
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,144
Don't you see it's a trap and where the bait to bring him here

405
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,544
But what can we do man if we try to make a run for it with your leg you might bleed to death stop calling me ma'am what did

406
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
What did I tell you

407
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,736
So just what are you did anyway I miss friend

408
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
What about you

409
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,040
I mean lady

410
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,000
Aren't you a friend of tennis too you must because even though you're hurt really bad you're still trying to save him

411
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,072
I'm not trying to be nosy but

412
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,120
You like 10 but don't you

413
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,448
Are you his girlfriend

414
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,592
Do you like 10

415
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,384
Yeah I like him a whole lot

416
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,432
What exactly do you like about him

417
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
Lots of things

418
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
What do you like about him

419
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:15,488
I know you're there crawl around all you want

420
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
You'd be pretty stupid to shoot me again I already told you if I die that picture of Johann is a child

421
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:28,288
So that you want so badly will automatically be sent straight to the bka I mean it this is your last warning

422
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:41,856
So that photo you've got is something you really want it's a lie and it might not work

423
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,416
He's too smart to fall for such

424
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,232
Lady are you feeling all right

425
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:51,584
Starting to fade I've lost a lot of blood

426
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,984
Now go we'll get out of here save yourself

427
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,384
Leave you 10 minutes on his way he would have been here by now he's got to be headed here I mean it

428
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,968
Look there's no way he would ever come to save me

429
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,040
Nothing but a waste of time

430
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
Dinner where are you

431
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,840
I'm over here just stay there

432
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm coming to get you Peter

433
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
Don't move

434
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,288
If you try to come get us there's a man here that's going to shoot you

435
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,336
That's why he's come here 10

436
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
To kill you

437
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,176
I know that voice but it can't be

438
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,760
Denmark this lady is a friend of yours

439
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,832
Been shot and she's bleeding a lot

440
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:51,488
You can't die now not what I'm so close I'm handing you over to the police

441
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:04,288
I want every waking moment to hurt for dumping me stop shouting you're straining

442
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,688
Yourself

443
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:15,552
Just tell me if you can hear me okay can you tell me the shooter is

444
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,392
No I don't know

445
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,976
I've got no clue where is he still here

446
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:29,120
Stop yelling to him I need 10 more

447
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:36,032
Hang in there he's getting close he's not coming to you wrong

448
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,360
He would never come to my rescue

449
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:48,832
It's all over for me don't die please

450
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:55,232
Why would she ever

451
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
What's all this why did you bring me out here

452
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
It's time for lunch

453
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
Your leg has been healing up nicely

454
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,520
And I thought you'd enjoy eating lunch outside in this beautiful sunshine

455
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
You're a lucky woman you know

456
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,360
What do you mean lucky

457
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
Just that

458
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,736
A guy who shot you was a real Pro you know what he was doing

459
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:53,088
He understood how difficult it would be for him to infiltrate this mountain Villa

460
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,696
There's only one path to get up here

461
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,512
And there are security cameras everywhere

462
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,912
He also knew this Villa would be guided by experienced men so it would be like he was attacking an Alpine Fortress

463
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,216
That was the reason he used you

464
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,776
Hold on what do you mean he used me

465
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,056
It's simple

466
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:19,456
He must have figured that a pretty woman making an unexpected visit would have a much better chance of getting all the way up here than

467
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,784
But when you betrayed him his old plan was sunk

468
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,856
He had no plan B there were no other options for him

469
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,928
So he got out of here quick and cut his losses

470
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
So then he got away

471
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
That's right

472
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,768
We search the whole Mountain

473
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:39,168
This is a special dish it's called chicken Marengo

474
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,032
I tried to recreate the recipe but I can't guarantee it'll be any good

475
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,872
You know there's another way you were very lucky

476
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,992
You were lucky to have a great doctor like Dr tender treating you

477
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:58,368
So is Tim still here

478
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,952
He already left where to

479
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,512
Thank you said something about going to Munich

480
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:10,912
Munich a

481
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:18,080
Let's see if you and I can enjoy this chicken I got a feeling you're like me and I bet

482
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,920
Long time since you sat down and enjoyed a meal in peace
