1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,896
Did you get that dress

2
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,744
You're an unfamiliar face

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,816
Get yourself a permit if you're looking to do business here

4
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,376
Last thing I need is an unlicensed hooker

5
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,936
Can't make as much cash when you're legal

6
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,496
Yeah good luck with that

7
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,848
I just need permission from him don't I

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
You let me meet him

9
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,968
Sorry I got no idea who you mean

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
I'll keep coming back until I meet him

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,344
Until

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,136
I meet the baby

13
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
You can't catch the ball with your hands like that you're not the goalkeeper with your whining who died and made you rap

14
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,608
Where the hell did you go to go

15
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Where'd you go

16
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
10 my dummy Tenma

17
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:53,056
He told me to stay with you for a while cuz he found the man he was looking for that's all

18
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
That's all

19
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
Who leaves a kid with someone like me

20
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,248
No way in hell thanks a lot of time I have to babysit

21
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:06,880
I hate kids first he drops off the face of the Earth and then he Saddles me with some random brat

22
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
Me and him had an agreement doesn't it mean nothing anymore what the hell kind of doctor doesn't want to make some easy money

23
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
Son of a

24
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,728
Did I look like I was ready to you hey

25
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,568
Remember what I said you can't use your hands that's a yellow card

26
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
I'm throwing this into traffic if you mentioned the rules one more time you keep talking like that you'll get a red card

27
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Shut up

28
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
Why the hell are you so late

29
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Hurry up and give me the stuff

30
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
Give me the stuff now

31
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
Long time no see detective Messner

32
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
That's right that's exactly what you called me back when we first met before I even got around to telling you what

33
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
My occupation was

34
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,199
But that was a long time ago my days in medicine are over

35
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
But I suppose you're no longer Detective

36
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
Detective suspended on narcotics charges

37
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,999
This article really came as a shock when I read it 6 months ago

38
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,839
Don't even think about running away

39
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
I have a gun trained on you under my jacket

40
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
All right what do you want with me

41
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,919
I need answers what happened in Heidelberg almost a year ago

42
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,015
And who was behind it all who ordered you to do such a terrible thing

43
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
I I don't know anything

44
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,927
You killed the foreigners and Mr Mauer from the post

45
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
It wasn't me that did it

46
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
I was hired as the lookout that's all

47
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,119
Detective Mueller also left the force soon after the murders

48
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Yeah he did

49
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,751
I hear that he's very well off turns out he's doing good with his money

50
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:36,383
You on the other hand ended up wasting all of your money on your drug habit that sound about right

51
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
He was the one who took on the job and he was the one who committed the murders he ended up getting a larger portion of the reward

52
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
They even tried to get rid of me

53
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
They they tried to kill me to make sure I didn't go to the cops

54
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
I'm surprised you're still breathing

55
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
It was the organization that helped me

56
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
Organization

57
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,655
Enough I already told her too much as it is

58
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
Told her her who leave me alone already I can't I

59
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,919
I can't deal with you right now looks like you're going through withdrawal

60
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:15,807
And with me sitting here no dealer would come within 20 ft of you so I suggest you start talking

61
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
I thought I was

62
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
I was saved by

63
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Baby

64
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
The baby

65
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,095
Go to a pub called candy you can find him there

66
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
Wait who's this baby you're talking about

67
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
He's all right wing extremist

68
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,055
He's also a high official and two of their major political parties

69
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:43,199
After the wall fell the baby tried to create a town of only pure-blooded Germans

70
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
But his plan failed and now he's come back

71
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
But why'd he do it

72
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
Why do you bother saving you

73
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
The darkness

74
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
After the Berlin Wall fell

75
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
A great Darkness was created

76
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
A monster

77
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
A monster was born

78
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
A monster

79
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
Now leave me alone I've already said everything to that girl you understand what girl Messner she came

80
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
Revenge had pointed a gun at me

81
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,039
She's the daughter of that older couple we murdered you're saying

82
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,927
I mean Nina Nina Fortner came to see you then

83
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
The baby said to me that I

84
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,607
But I was to send that girl to him if I ever saw or if she ever showed up around these parts

85
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
He said

86
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
That she's important to use as B

87
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
He's using

88
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
As base

89
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
You don't give up do you

90
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,015
You're getting to be a regular coming back all the time

91
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,111
How about I rent you for an hour or two so the night ain't a total waste

92
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
You're the one who said I'd get in trouble if I did business without the babies permission

93
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
Yeah not so clever now are you

94
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,263
Is this the girl who keeps asking to see the baby

95
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Yes sir

96
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
It seems you're getting your wish

97
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
Don't keep him waiting

98
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
Please wait right here

99
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Stand on that imot

100
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
If you'd be so kind

101
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,063
Directly over the iris please

102
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Much better

103
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,967
Like we met I know I need

104
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:30,367
And if I had the chance

105
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,767
Resonate with you right down to the soles of

106
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
See I have to dance

107
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:49,567
The baby told me the day another Hitler

108
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
Born to us our country will be saved the girl will be the perfect

109
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,767
How is it that you know my name

110
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:15,167
The name of Anna leave with the former is just as false is the latter A Rose by Any Other Name does

111
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
Smell is sweet but they call me the baby so I'm biased come on let's cut the rug of it is

00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
True that you know where my brother is right now good name

No don't you I'm going to do when you finally have your little family reunion

00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:40,767
I'm going to take him down

00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167
You shouldn't ripped that out really really miss someone's liable to get hurt patients did

00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,567
Why I'm sure Johan is searching for you even as we speak

117
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,551
I lived around here when I was your age no this place like the back of my

What are you talking about

127
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,839
You can't pick this kind of quality

128
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
It's synthetic

00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887

Look at the detail there in the patterns

00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
That runs real

145
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,903

Are you crazy and Asian like you is going to get killed if you walk into a place like that

158
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:38,175
They don't take kindly to foreigners in there but your Turkish aren't you is it all right for you to be doing business

Do you miss around here what are you stupid I wouldn't do business in a dump like this

160
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,903
A friend of mine was just abducted by a bunch of guys who are regulars there what

161
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719

Without your gun on this point I'm afraid I must insist

176
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
Thank you for your cooperation

177
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,855
Go ahead and sit wherever you like

178
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
So the baby brought you in

179
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,423
Eyes forward let me see your face

180
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Goodness

181
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
But I should have known you'd be quite a beauty

182
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,895
After all you are a Johan's twin sister

183
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,951
My name is Professor guidlitz

184
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,791
And the man standing next to Johan in the picture is General

185
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,935
We created this organization along with a pair of other like-minded individuals

186
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Where are my manners

187
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
Would you care for some fruit

188
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
No thank you

189
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
I want to see Johan

190
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
And see him you will

191
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,735
Once he knows that you're here no force on Earth could keep him away

192
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,807
The boys suffers mightily in your absence

193
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,879
You people don't know where Johan is either do you

194
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
We need him

195
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,719
His country needs him

196
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,559
We for shall help him fulfill his destiny

197
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,983
Do you have any idea how Hitler became possessed of such power

198
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
It's because he saw the three things a person would have to do to gain control of a country

199
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,343
Manipulate the banks feed the War Machine and take command of the military

200
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,439
I'm sure johans working on one of those things right now

201
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:05,791
What exactly do you plan to do with Johan think of it

202
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:12,191
Hitler been a weekend Nation to his will using nothing but raw Charisma all that from a man

203
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:18,591
Who only made Corporal a man whom Art School wouldn't Dane to let in his

204
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,663
My appeared after he hit his 30s

205
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:28,319
Not so with your brother Johan he was a leader of men even as a mere boy

206
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,719
Charisma of Messianic proportions but even Jesus Christ

207
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
That help consider the three Magi and John the Baptist who heralded the savior's arrival into the world

208
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
Are they ready the way for his glory

209
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
Likewise the four of us have been keeping track of your hands talents ever since he was a little boy

210
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Exciting wouldn't you say

211
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,175
What is it that you want with me

212
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,319
Please accept our Hospitality until Johan comes looking for you at the very least

213
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:05,951
Actually I'm afraid I must insist you know too much for us to let you walk away now

214
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,631
Don't worry about that I came here of my own volition I will wait here for you hun

215
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
Then we agree

216
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Now then

217
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
You should at least try the fruit

218
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
Good you're finally awake

219
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,159
Don't look so worried we're not going to hurt you

220
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
That's right away at least

221
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,791
So what brings you to my little slice of the world

222
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
Doctor ten

223
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
Wait how do you already know what my name is

224
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
Why don't you leave the questions to me

225
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,799
Now all you have to do is answer

226
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,359
Why exactly were you snooping around

227
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,759
I know you're looking for Johan but I can't figure out why where are you keeping Nina

228
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,831
I told you leave the questions to me did I not

229
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
What are you going to do with her

230
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,439
Why do you insist on texting me

231
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:17,119
Nina is our guest whereas you are just a metal some piece of trash to be disposed of

232
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
Is she okay

233
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
At the moment

234
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
But that'll change soon enough

235
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,591
She's determined to kill your heart and we simply can't have that

236
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,431
Always ashamed when a pretty girl dies before her time

237
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,015
You're just using Nina as bait to draw out Johann

238
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,063
What are you planning on doing

239
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,463
The hell are you pictures

240
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,079
The whole quarter indeed

241
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
The night sky tomorrow will be a thing of beauty of fiery cleansing

242
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
If I stay here

243
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
Then I'll find you

244
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Please

245
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
Who are you

246
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
Where are you right now

247
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,271
It sounds like you're speaking with an accent

248
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Where are you from

249
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Let me escape

250
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,144
Tomorrow night we celebrate in honor of johann's homecoming

251
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:33,056
Only the members of the pure Master race like us deserve to survive everything

252
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
And she'll just burn away

253
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,680
Hey kid where the hell are you going

254
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,984
Come on give me a break

255
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,360
Leaving that rug in this town is a complete waste that guy doesn't know what it's worth

256
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:11,456
How many times do I got to tell you stop looking at me like that

257
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
Slime ball

258
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:19,136
Yes see if I care don't come crying to me when you're starving and I'm living like a king

259
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:24,256
And if you tell anybody about this you're going to pay for you got that

260
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:31,168
Who would want to be friends with a dirty Thief like him anyway I don't need him

261
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,944
I'm so hungry right now they're there don't cry be

262
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,344
Good boy mom is coming back soon I promise what's wrong doesn't he have a mom

263
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Go home too

264
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,264
Hey I'm sorry if what I said hurt your feelings kid it's all right

265
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
I've got 10 more

266
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,064
Eat as much as you want it's nothing special but don't feel like you got to hold back

267
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:26,720
So you're just sitting on the steps waiting for that tender guy to come back and get you huh

268
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,816
That little guy is waiting too

269
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,888
Where's his mom why did she leave where'd she go

270
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
A bunch of bad guys came and took her away

271
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
We got to save her

272
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
It's just so dangerous out there

273
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:46,176
An Asian man I met said he was going to try and help her but then he got hit by a car right in front of me

274
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
An Asian man

275
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Wait

276
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,296
You said 10 Mile was Japanese didn't you

277
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,368
But there's no way it could be the same person could it

278
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,416
Where are they I've got to help them

279
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
The man who hired me

280
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,520
On the phone

281
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,872
I heard him say that I'm going to burn the entire town tomorrow

282
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,552
Please you must help me

283
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
My baby

284
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,904
I don't want my baby to die

285
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
That's easy

286
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
Who is it

287
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
Professor guidlitz has asked me to bring you some fruit

288
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
Thank you very much

289
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
The professor also asked me to deliver a message

290
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,664
General vote will be here shortly and would like to meet with you

291
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,504
You mean the man in the photograph with my brother

292
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
That's right

293
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,112
General wolf is the person who knows Johann better than anyone

294
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,696
Probably even more than you do even though you're his twin sister

295
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
That's what Professor Gilead said

296
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,680
No don't go dying on me just yet

297
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,240
General Volks going to be here in a minute

298
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,104
And I want him to see what a wonderful job I've done of capturing you alive

299
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
Well if you say

300
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,784
That's General to you do you understand excuse me sir

301
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,136
We've assembled our members in the arson teams ready to set fire to the Turkish quarter

302
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,696
Shall we continue with the plan is scheduled

303
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
Yes proceed with the itinerary

304
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,584
I'm looking forward to dinner with a view of a beautiful creams in the sky

305
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,192
Be sure everything stays on schedule otherwise my perfect dinner will be ruin

306
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,056
And tell them that if anything goes wrong forgiveness will come at a very high price

307
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
Yes sir

308
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
He won't do it

309
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,176
Johan isn't going to lead you

310
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,808
He'll never be able to convince Johann to lead your organization are you out of your mind

311
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:08,256
Johan doesn't share your simple-minded views on racial Purity he's not just an ignorant bigot like all of you

312
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,352
He's different don't you see he looks down on all Humanity

313
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
Silence

314
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
Well well what do we have here

315
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,784
Hey get this gentleman a drink on me I'm thinking the usual

316
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
Right away

317
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Well

318
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,480
Not bad for a little guy that kid's going to be serious trouble when he grows up

319
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
That was disgusting

320
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
How can they drink that stuff

321
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
This is 10 ms Jack

322
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,312
Where are you

323
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,344
Everything will be all right just calm down

324
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
I want to help you get out of here but

325
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
I can't really do anything right now

326
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:46,048
I'm going to sneak out of here and I warn everybody in your neighborhood

327
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
What's the name of the street

328
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
And what's your name

329
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,360
I don't want you to worry about anything okay

330
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,432
Promise you your baby is going to be just fine

331
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,224
I'm going to save you too

332
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
Hang in there

333
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
I forgot to ask you a name

334
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Nina

335
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,488
And when this is over I hope we get to know each other better

336
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,888
I've had so many bad things happen to me since I came to Germany

337
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,152
I forgot to ask you what's your baby's name

338
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
Hey I say

339
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
Are you there

340
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,184
What's happening

341
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,584
Leave her alone

342
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:03,520
Tell me is the man sitting in that chair Dr Tema very own hand

343
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
So where is General wolf

344
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,128
General wolf is waiting

345
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,920
Will be taking the doctor to him

346
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,088
No wait what do you mean but I wanted to show General wolf my prize catch and then finish him off myself

347
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,392
So what do you want me to do with this kid

348
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:26,816
I found them walking around downstairs looking for Tenma it's a friend of yours

349
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,864
No of course not

350
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
Metro has nothing to do with this just let him go

351
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:37,568
You don't really expect me to take a filthy Street agent like this to General wolf do you

352
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:44,480
Dispose of him you heard me finish him off go ahead got the little bread

353
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,552
Already he bothers me yes sir

354
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
Stop no

355
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:14,688
One of my men

356
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:19,040
My apologies doctor please forgive us for the rude treatment you've received

357
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:25,440
It's very important to General wolf that you be treated as his guest

358
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Poor I say

359
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Please

360
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,808
Help me escape

361
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,136
I have to warn the other so my baby will die too

362
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,976
We are

363
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
Isn't that the

364
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
Yes we are I say

365
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
We are friends

366
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,224
What happened here

367
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,224
Everybody's dead

368
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,368
We should be arriving at General Volks Mansion momentarily

369
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:05,280
Tell me is Nina going to be there yes you can rest assured she is all so considered to be a special guest

370
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:11,680
List of General wolf what about the Turkish lady the baby's mom I don't know we don't know anything at all

371
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:18,080
We simply follow orders and nothing else

372
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:24,480
Burn Tonight We got to go back we have to let them know where the lady who gave me dinner last night and the baby are going to die

373
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:30,880
We're all going to die be that as it may young man I can't let you go we must take

374
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:36,256
The general Volks mansion

375
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:42,656
Think you can make it to the Turkish quarter on your own

376
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:46,496
I'll be there soon but right now it's important that I go with these men

377
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
But

378
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:53,920
You can do it I know you can if you go right now you'll be able to save everyone on Calvin Street go on

379
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,576
From here you should be able to get to the city in 30 minutes

380
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:08,768
I apologize but I had to do that I had no choice

381
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:15,168
Now I know you trusted me enough to give me back my gun and I may have just broken that trust but it didn't seem like you were going to stop

382
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:21,568
It's fine I'm sure General wolf will be pleased to know that you don't just carry a gun around

383
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:26,688
For show and that you're not afraid to use it when needed

384
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:38,464
If you would please follow me where's Nina I want to see her she is here isn't she

385
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
Pat

386
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:45,888
Before we do anything else we must see General wolf and Professor gilitz I just need to know for myself that she's safe

387
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,960
Professor against his

388
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:56,640
And it's not just katelets all of these men have

389
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,480
Also been killed we've disposed of the bodies

390
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
Everything's been taken care of

391
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:08,928
What about Nina when we first arrived with General volt we search the entire Mansion she was

392
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,464
Nowhere to be found

393
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,024
Your doctor tenmark corre

394
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,704
Wait do I know you

395
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,104
You wouldn't recognize me even if you saw my face

396
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,528
I don't recognize me but people call me for both

397
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:40,928
That means that you you don't look anything like the picture from 10 years ago

398
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:47,328
That's because

399
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
Fear has aged

400
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:55,520
Sir please hurry can't you go any faster you crazy

401
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,920
Pushing 200 here must be broken there's no way I'm going to make

402
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,480
Take it in time

403
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:09,344
I think people's names are very interesting mysterious

404
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,672
All the places I've been throughout my life

405
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
Everybody has referred to me

406
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
On the other hand

407
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,144
Every time I encounter someone new

408
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,216
I must tell them that my name is

409
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,008
I wonder

410
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
How can they really know that is

411
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,384
What's there to prove that I really am

412
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:36,480
You're the one who found Johan and his sister isn't that right

413
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,016
I did

414
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,064
It's happened 12 years ago

415
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,952
And that's when he was sent to 511 kinderheim they were going to tournament to a super soldier weren't they

416
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,512
But you had bigger plans for him

417
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
That's correct

418
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
He was supposed to become

419
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:58,496
Hot country safer before it's downfall and now you're trying to make sure he becomes the next Adolf Hitler so that he

420
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,312
Can lead the ultranationalist isn't that your plan

421
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:12,576
At the moment I'm only part of this organization because it benefits me

422
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,672
I did hear that the others are trying to make him into another

423
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,232
I think it's a stupid

424
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:27,424
Imagine if a man like Hitler was able to take things as far as he did

425
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,216
Johan could do more

426
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
Yes

427
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,616
I was the one who gave him the name Johann

428
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,248
We found the twins wondering near the check border

429
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,368
They had managed to evade the heavy security patrol somehow

430
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,184
They were dead on their feet

431
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:54,816
Malnourished to almost frozen to death

432
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,912
When we finally arrived the two of them simply coll

433
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,032
They both would have perished if we hadn't found them when we did

434
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
I too know what it's like to have saved Johannes life

435
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:17,344
When he became Consciousness I asked him a simple question

436
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,416
How do you feel I

437
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,744
And do you know what his reply was

438
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,024
He said

439
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,328
You will know very soon

440
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:34,752
I know there's no more proof I really

441
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:41,408
All the people who knew me have disappeared my wife

442
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:45,248
Children siblings relatives friends

443
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,552
Everybody from my life

444
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:54,208
Is dead all of them died one by one I have your heart

445
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:54,976
For

446
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:03,424
The money I brought with me back for me is Germany is the only proof I have

447
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,472
Good morning name is

448
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:12,128
Because of your heart I am a stranger to all you will

449
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
Very soon

450
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,992
No I understand what he

451
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,576
Loneliness

452
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:24,928
Take a look at this doctor

453
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:32,096
Come to the abandoned warehouse of hilden and Engels company in rombark

454
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
Johann was here this morning

455
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:41,056
He came here to slaughter he let's send his men yet

456
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,152
Other person who knew me has been murdered

457
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,552
I imagine Nina must have seen this and gone there

458
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
For

459
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,416
Please kill him my back of you

460
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,072
Calm down kid what are you talking about

461
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:10,496
Calvin street is going to burn tonight we have to hurry and tell everyone I can't believe this

462
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
This is amazing it must be my lucky day

463
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,384
This is great now I can grab that rug during the fire

464
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,736
What it's score how can you think that way

465
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:27,136
Keep it down you little brat if you tell anyone about this I swear out hey let me go

466
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:33,536
Kid I'm not just talking about all those Turks okay if any of the right Wingers find out what we know we're dead

467
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:38,912
What you didn't notice all the guys with the freaking she wants the good tattoos around here

468
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:50,432
One

469
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:53,760
What question was the Turkish woman being held hostage in there

470
00:40:54,016 --> 00:41:00,160
We found a dead woman on the third floor based on what we saw I don't think Johan killed her look like it was the work

471
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:06,560
Professor gelitzman well General wolf do you

472
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:12,960
Really think you'll be able to kill Johan I don't know however he still has time

473
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:19,360
Maybe able to

474
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:43,680
What is this supposed to mean

475
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
She has a baby back there in the new Nazis are planning to burn the town

476
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:06,463
The Turkish woman was found dead up on the third floor

477
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:15,935
We are approaching the meeting place where Johan will be expecting you I'm not sure what will happen there

478
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:22,335
You do know how to use that gun right Calvin Street Frankfort now

479
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:28,735
My plans have changed why the sudden change of heart what about killing Johan I'll deal with him later now

480
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:35,135
Do as I say General wolf will be disappointed to hear this news he personally requested that you kill Johan

481
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:41,535
Believed you with a man for the job I don't care I don't take requests from anyone I'm going to

482
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:46,399
I killed Johann of my own accord now hurry up and get to Calvin Street

483
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:53,823
All ignition points are ready to go sir

484
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,871
Awaiting your orders to proceed

485
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
Well done

486
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:01,247
Time to celebrate our superiority with a little Firepower

487
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
Now what are we going to do with them these two are an insult to our race

488
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:15,071
This place is going to burn anyway leave them for the flames

489
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,703
Oh come on little one don't cry

490
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,287
Your mom is coming back real soon

491
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,759
I can't believe you're still alive

492
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,063
How'd you find me

493
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,415
It's all thanks to Dieter he told me that you lived in this building

494
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Where is Teeter

495
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,327
Didn't he come by

496
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Where do you go

497
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
Hey have you seen Aisha

498
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,823
He needs her he misses his mom a lot

499
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
It can't

500
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,063
It's not possible I don't believe it

501
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,463
What about this poor little child he's too young to be without a mother what am I going to do what do I do

502
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,279
She's the last

503
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,095
There mustn't be any more victims

504
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,679
I need to see the leaders of the Turkish quarter now

505
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,127
So what does everyone think

506
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
Set the town on fire huh

507
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,943
Not likely

508
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,527
We are rumors about the right wing extremists all the time

509
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,343
We can't overreact every time they threaten us

510
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:46,975
What's even more suspicious to me is this Japanese guy Waltzing in here though he says his life is

511
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:54,143
What's the matter with all of you I say it's dead don't you get it she was killed because she tried to warn all of us about this Danger

512
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,239
I wonder about that he was a prostitute like you right

513
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:02,079
You women go off with Germans all the time and end up missing

514
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
That's nothing new

515
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,663
You may call us Turks look bad

516
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,479
How do we really know whose kid that is anyway

517
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,623
You all know how hard it is to make a living you should know better than to act like this

518
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,159
If you want to live

519
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,207
You've got to listen to me

520
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:23,839
Forget it do what you want you can burn and go to hell for all I care

521
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,655
No we just one second

522
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
Are you suggesting Patrol groups

523
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:36,127
Maybe we should do is this Japanese man says we have nothing to lose Mr Denny's

524
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
Are you really going to listen to some Asian we don't know

525
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:45,599
He might be suspicious but there are certainly plenty of trustworthy Japanese people

526
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
In the world

527
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,927
General Logie for example

528
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
General Noki

529
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,511
You mean you don't know about him

530
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:59,167
General know he was a brave Japanese man who saved the Turkish navy when they were lost in the Pacific years

531
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
Years ago

532
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,055
Go ahead and gather all our man immediately

533
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:11,711
It looks so delicious let's dig in

534
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,783
Sally no need to be in such a hurry ladies

535
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,807
Take your

536
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,159
We wouldn't want to finish eating before the entertainment

537
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:25,535
I planned it so by the time the main course comes around the show will be reaching its climax

538
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:30,911
In the meantime let's enjoy the 76 Chateau Le Tour I saved especially for this night

539
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,823
The first dish we will indulge in is my

540
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,383
Raw Flounder with caviar

541
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,991
And does the feast begin

542
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,343
Voila the first fire

543
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,391
What a wonderful start

544
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,719
But like I told you that's still just an appetizer

545
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,767
Where is the main course

546
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,839
Remember what I said don't be impatient

547
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:04,447
If you Savor your dinner my show will be something you'll truly enjoy

548
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:11,103
Oh yeah because I don't know we need more fire extinguishers

549
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:23,903
Save the women and children what a lovely surprise and

550
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
What do we owe this honor

551
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,719
Don't even try it

552
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:30,815
Or kiss your boss goodbye dangerous thing away

553
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,631
Why don't we enjoy this meal together

554
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,983
Unfortunately it seems your appetizer is fizzling out

555
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,079
Don't worry that was just the beginning

556
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
This is your favorite right

557
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,247
Sorry about that

558
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,319
Don't be so contrary my dear

559
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,855
You see after all

560
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
This is a great celebration

561
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,439
In honor of your

562
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:00,511
Listen to me Johan doesn't want any of this

563
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,095
And tell me how can you be so

564
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:09,727
I saw it with my own eyes I followed his messages I know what he wants

565
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,543
Johan doesn't care about your plans

566
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,871
What exactly did you see

567
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:24,575
He doesn't want any of this don't you understand okay

568
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:29,183
Relax calm down just take it easy because of you

569
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,743
I won't let anybody else die tonight

570
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:38,143
So where's the main course what part of town are you going to sit on fire

571
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:44,543
Take

572
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:50,943
I hope you had any luck finding Dieter someone

573
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,343
Told me they saw a kid who looked like him near the park around noon

574
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
No just

575
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,943
Continue with my dinner is planned that girl sure is something I suppose it must run in the

576
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:29,343
The look she had in her eyes she was really going to

577
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:35,743
It's a good thing she didn't realize how close I was to giving her the actual location of the

578
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,815
Main course well shall we bring out the next dish

579
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,399
No make me some underwear first

580
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:49,311
A scary girl isn't she

581
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:26,431
Are you going to be just fine everything's okay all right thanks for getting

582
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:30,783
How did the two of you end up here anyway

583
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:35,647
You want to know what happened lady this bread almost got me killed

584
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,695
Forget this

585
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,487
I'm getting the hell out of here

586
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:44,863
If that was the smallest fire those skinheads said I wouldn't be a bit surprised

587
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,727
I grew up in this neighborhood I know the place like the back of my hand

588
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:53,823
If I wanted to burn down the town this wouldn't be the spot believe you me

589
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,919
This town ain't out of the woods just yet

590
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,367
There were three other fires up wind that were all so put out

591
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,671
We can't thank you enough for your help

592
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
Right everyone

593
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,351
Our next step is to take care of the injured

594
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,935
No I won't have any more victims not one more

595
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,495
Wait what are you talking about

596
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,543
Well the wind's going to change direction

597
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:31,199
It always happens every night around this time the wind just stops and it starts blowing towards town from where the

598
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
The wind

599
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:47,839
And now time for the main

600
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,119
To be served

601
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
You see them running away

602
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,287
Allow me to buy this round

603
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,895
That should take care of it thanks for patching me up doctor

604
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,431
Let me buy you a drink

605
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,759
What are you talking about you have to take it easy for a while

606
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,831
Oh come on loosen up Dr right

607
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:15,231
That's right it's thanks to you we were able to put out those fires and save the neighborhood I bet those Neon

608
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,703
No doubt they are that'll teach him never underestimate that text what are they tendon

609
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,519
All the other injured people

610
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:33,919
Hey doctor Tenma take a break and relax come on why don't you have a drink with us

611
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,223
Not until everyone's taken care of

612
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,575
If all of the fires up until now we're just diversions

613
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:46,719
Where do you think they're going to light the real fire how the hell would I know who cares about this stupid town anyway

614
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:53,119
Besides there's something much more important on my mind that I got to take care of wait I need you to tell me

615
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:58,495
And I need you to tell me now where would you start the real fire get your hands off of me

616
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,823
Like I already told you the wind's going to come from the river

617
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:05,919
The abandoned Factory down there would be a perfect place for a fire

618
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:10,015
If I'm not mistaken there should still be a bunch of chemicals in the warehouse

619
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:16,159
Long

620
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:22,559
Something I can sink my teeth into yeah this is going to be

621
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:31,519
We're right on schedule the celebration of the

622
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,919
The race is about to begin

623
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:57,119
It's you why did you follow me because I have to put out the fire I made a promise to

624
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:12,735
Is it it's the warehouse

625
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:19,135
Thank goodness looks like they haven't found this place yet these are all filled with chemicals

626
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:25,535
If all of this were to go up it'd be hopeless it'd be nothing left of the town

627
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:31,935
Check this place no matter what I'm not going to let those horrible people burn it down

628
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,823
What the heck is this

629
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:46,015
Smells like Castle

630
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,367
It looks like what's there

631
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,671
It's all right I'm fine

632
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:57,279
Hey you can walk on my own let's get you to a shelter so I can have a closer look at it

633
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,399
Hey twisted my ankle it probably happened when I was trying to get away from the fire

634
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:09,567
Now that I finally got this rug who gives a damn about this stinking town

635
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,943
I bet I can probably get $800,000 marks for this baby no a million

636
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:26,719
What happened to Dieter couldn't say he's probably where is he where did he go what happened to him

637
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:30,815
Last I saw he was going to the abandoned warehouse by the river

638
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,351
Why there

639
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,911
The wind's going to blow in from the river soon

640
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,263
So if the chemicals in that warehouse are set on fire it's all over for this town

641
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:47,711
This is what I was talking about

642
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:54,111
Tell everyone to evacuate from the Riverside shelters right away you're going to take me there

643
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999
Who is

644
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
Who's back there

645
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,503
Please don't move

646
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,039
Can it be true

647
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:27,135
Are you really Johan's sister

648
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:30,463
Once I sent this trail of gasoline on fire

649
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,535
This Warehouse is going to go up in an instant

650
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:39,935
I'm going to shoot you in the head before that happens I can fire quicker than you can flick that lighter and I'm not afraid to do it

651
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:44,287
And what if you miss I haven't skipped a day of training in 6 months straight

652
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,079
So I know

653
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,615
I can hit you from here

654
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,895
You don't frighten me

655
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:52,735
Don't you know this is a celebration of the master race

656
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,783
This is our big welcome for Johan

657
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,855
But Johan doesn't want any of the things you want

658
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:02,463
Yes it's true that he was recently seen here in Frankfurt

659
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:07,071
The only reason he came was to kill one of your leaders and all of his subordinates

660
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,631
He left a message behind you know

661
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,423
What message

662
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,007
Listen to me Johan is not the person you think he is

663
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,287
The truth

664
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,871
Is much more complex than that what are you trying to say

665
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
It's worse

666
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,455
It must be terrifying for him

667
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:30,111
He's suffering he's an anguish and teetering on the edge of despair

668
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:36,511
You know I'm not so sure it's such a good idea to be making enemies of these guys which way to the warehouse

669
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:42,911
I didn't sign on for all of this I'm going to call it a day see you

670
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:49,311
The hell do you think you're going are you just going to let date or die like that tell me where the warehouse

671
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:55,711
Let me go you choking me you told me about your friend you said that his name is

672
00:57:55,967 --> 00:58:01,599
Right would you believe that I know a man whose name is Tenma also for real

673
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,903
Is your timer Really Brave too

674
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:08,255
Yes but he must never fire a gun not if I can do it for him

675
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:14,655
I don't want him to kill anyone he's a good man killing people is always wrong you understand

676
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,703
Even if they're the bad guys

677
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,775
Right don't ever do what I'm about to do

678
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:27,199
Close your eyes don't look don't shoot

679
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:46,399
Quick I can put up the fire

680
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,159
1 million marks

681
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,511
Nina

682
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,495
Damn it all the cops are coming

683
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:27,359
Get out go I'll take care of things here there's a boat over by the river

684
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,663
Please tell me you have to leave now

00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,927

01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:31,871
I'm heading there now the night I shot my brother

693
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:38,271
Now I understand

694
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:44,671
He's not alone there are two of them inside

695
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:57,471
That's why

696
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,079
It wasn't your fault you didn't do anything wrong

697
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,967
I must

698
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,783
I have no other choice

699
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:17,183
I have to shoot you hun again

700
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,887
Hey wait up

701
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,191
What the hell are we doing here anyway

702
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,239
Come on let's get out of here

703
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,311
There's no use for this guy

704
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,871
I guess I'll be starving and broke forever

705
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,687
If only I still had that

706
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
Damn it

707
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,879
The hell's that supposed to be

708
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,487
Message

709
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:06,591
The monster inside me

710
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,663
About to explode

711
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,855
Let's see if I got this straight

712
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:24,511
So you told us when you arrived at the warehouse you witnessed the Asian man in the arsonist engaging in

713
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
Verbal argument

714
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:29,631
According to your statement on it as soon as the Asian man saw you there he quickly fled

715
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,959
So Ms Liebert is that exactly how you saw it

716
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,495
Answer

717
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,847
Well it's good that Firebug ended up turning himself in

718
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:43,967
You confess that he's a right-wing extremist said he was celebrating his people when he let the fire

719
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,807
Anyway Ms Liebert your records clean so that's all we need from you today

720
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,855
We do appreciate your cooperation

721
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:53,439
So then you're saying that I can go home now detect

722
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,975
Yes ma'am

723
01:02:59,327 --> 01:02:59,839
Oh

724
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,607
Hold on

725
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:06,751
There's one thing I forgot to ask about the townsfolk refer to the Asian man you mentioned is Dr Tenma

726
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,543
Ms Lieber

727
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,615
You wouldn't happen to know anything else about this guy would you

728
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,967
No I don't know anything about him

729
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,623
Tell me what are you thinking

730
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:27,999
I'd say from the way Ms Liebert was dressed she might just be a high-class call girl

731
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,791
That isn't what I meant

732
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,119
I'm talking about Dr Tim

733
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:39,007
When we first spoke to the church from that District all of them referred to our Asian guys Dr Tenma

734
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:44,639
But as soon as we told them the doctor was under investigation and suspected to be a serial killer

735
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:49,247
They got real tight lift all of the sudden none of them knew who he was

736
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:01,535
They told me I'm responsible for you now

737
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,839
Mr Russo

738
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:10,751
Yeah it's so great to see you I was worried about you when

739
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:28,671
Now that's more like it

740
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:34,303
There now you look more like the honor I've always known I like you better in casual clothes

741
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:40,959
Come on sit down and eat I ordered what you like enjoy

742
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,239
So aren't you going to eat

743
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:47,103
No thanks dear I've already eaten I'll just have me some coffee

744
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,943
Go on dig in thank you

745
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:57,343
I am pretty hungry

746
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:07,839
What's so funny

747
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:17,567
Well that's what tastes best I say coffee isn't any good at all if it isn't sweet

748
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:25,759
It's good to see you can smile

749
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,343
It's good to see you can smile

750
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,535
I know you're in the middle of a big job interview and up to now you've looked quite serious

751
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:41,375
But your smiled when you saw me put all that sugar in my coffee

752
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,935
Your names on

753
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,727

754
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
So

755
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,615
Well Ms leebert the job's yours

756
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,919
Don't start today

757
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:59,039
Having a young lady like you waiting tables in my Cafe might give my business quite a boost

758
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
Except what

759
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,647
Do me a favor

760
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,951
Show off that smile a little more all right

761
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,767
When you smile it'll make everyone feel good

762
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,583
Thank you so much for the job

763
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,375

01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:19,775
Chances are you may not have to this is an Italian restaurant in a small town

Okay hey Russo come on you got to tell us how you trick this cutie into working here

789

I didn't have to trick her guess I was just my charming so

790
01:08:54,143 --> 01:09:00,287
Hey Anna if you're free tonight how about you let me take you out to a real restaurant it'll be fun

01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:06,687
Hold on just forget about trying to make time with my Anna I'd hate to have to hurt you oh boy listen to the

792
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:13,087
Cry Baby Ross so everybody suddenly acting all tough hey where do you get a load of this last week he was at my house watch

793
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:19,487
Watching a TV Movie Falling like a baby

794
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:23,583
Another order of squidding risotto

795
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,055
Summertime is playing across the street

796
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:38,431
That old movie house is screening summertime see you there

797
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:46,623
What a city Frankfurt has

798
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:51,999
So many great old movie theaters that movie was on TV just last week

799
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,559
That one really brings me to tears

800
01:09:55,071 --> 01:10:00,191
Have you ever seen summertime it's touching

801
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:04,543
The whole thing takes place in Italy actually in the city of Venice

802
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:10,943
Folks don't know the history of Venice it was a port city back in medieval days and everyone called it the city of

803
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:19,135
The entire city of Venice was originally built on a lagoon there are these canals that run through

804
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
The whole thing

805
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:24,255
I'd really like to go see it with you someday it's just beautiful

806
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,351
It sounds to me like you've been there before I have

807
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:35,007
The film soundtrack is great music it's very well composed I bet you've heard it's theme song I'd say

808
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,079
Most folks have heard it it was a popular very well-known song

809
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,871
Tell me how does it go

810
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,175
Let's see

811
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:55,743
Hey I know let's go across the street and see it right now we've missed some but they'll still let us in

812
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:04,191
Some other time it is kind of late and you're still eating

813
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,983
Sorry

814
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,039
Well I'm back

815
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,319
Great

816
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,855
So how was your break

817
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,463
Oh can I scrub that for you no thanks I can handle it

818
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:32,863
I appreciate you letting me take off a few hours from work every afternoon it's always

819
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,911
Flow around this time of the day

820
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,751
And I don't want to be nosy but

821
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,335
Where do you go everyday

822
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:50,271
Hey forget I asked it's your private time it's none of my

823
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:56,159
Business where you go

824
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,999
Oh learning to shoot

825
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,303
At Mr venkles firing range

826
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,375
You're learning at wrinkles Place huh

827
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,447
He's good people

828
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:26,111
Tell me Mr Russo have you ever shot a gun before

829
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:34,303
Me shooting guns no way honestly I get all nervous just looking at them

830
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,935
Here you go sir enjoy thank you very much

831
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:27,455
How do I do this time take a taste

832
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:32,063
No you should try it

833
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,559
Tell me what's it taste like

834
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:48,959
Like there's some garlic olive oil parsley and not much else

835
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:54,079
You're a gun right that just means you're having learned how to make it proper

836
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,407
This cooking stuff

837
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:59,967
Anything worth learning takes practice

838
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:14,303
I'm all done with the bathroom Mr Rosso I'm heading for bed now so

839
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:31,455
When I was younger I never realized that movies like this existed

840
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,999
Mr Rosso

841
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,815
Movies have always affected you deeply

842
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,095
That's true

843
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:53,215
When I was younger I always wanted to watch movies but with work I never had the time to

844
01:15:54,495 --> 01:16:00,639
Back then I ate a lot of fabulous meals but to be really honest I never felt any of them had any tast

845
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
Flavor

846
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:04,735
I didn't even appreciate the taste of sugar then

847
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,527
Really is that the truth

848
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,367
You know my past

849
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:13,951
Isn't that right Anna

850
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:19,583
Well after you left I checked up on you and I know what happened

851
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:29,055
You really need a Fortner

852
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:32,895
And you disappeared 2 years ago after your parents were murdered

853
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:40,063
Exactly what were you looking for me to do what are you looking

854
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:46,463
Looking for me to do a hit or did you want me to teach you to kill

855
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,327
I guess I wanted to learn from you that was it

856
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:56,959
So how did you find out about me and what I did

857
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:03,359
From one of my professors at law school he had done research on you and all the cases you were involved in

858
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,663
The Ristorante Nino case

859
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,455
Osaka Milano case

860
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,759
A sub 18 murder case

861
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:13,855
You were called into court to testify in all three of those murder cases

862
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,903
And in each of those cases

863
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,999
All charges were dropped due to a complete lack of evidence

864
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:27,423
However my professor came up with a theory about it that made sense there was only one conclusion

865
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:33,823
A world class Hitman committed all three of the murders and

866
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,359
You were that man

867
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:57,887
I suppose you want to know how many people I killed

868
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,751
To be honest with you I can't even remember

869
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,591
I was never a good kid

870
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:10,175
And before I knew what was what I was in way over my head

871
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,479
Robbery blackmail

872
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,271
If you can name it then I did it

873
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,343
And eventually I became a hitman

874
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:23,999
I rewarded Myself by eating very well

875
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:35,775
I never had any feelings about it it was just my job

876
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:48,575
Just wondering I

877
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:54,975
Doing what I always did waiting to kill some faceless guy

878
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:14,175
It was sunny and he was

879
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:22,623
I've been doing it so long I was numb I didn't know how many I killed or who was next

880
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:25,951
I had him as good as Dad

881
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:32,351
He had ordered a coffee and as I watched he started putting sugar in it

882
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:38,751
One spoonful two spoonfuls

883
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:45,151
Four after

884
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:51,551
5th Spoonful they stopped black moment started me finally tasting the

885
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:57,951
I drink when I saw how he was

886
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:04,095
Doing that coffee I couldn't do it

887
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,287
That was the day I put my gun down for good

888
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,968
That part of my life is done

889
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:23,552
I know I can't kill people and steal their Simple Pleasures

890
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:31,488
After all the time we spent together I don't get it you never asked me to teach you how to kill someone

891
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,584
I decided

892
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:40,192
I decided that getting you involved wouldn't be right

893
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,768
Do you really have to go Nina

894
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
Goodby

895
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,896
Thank you for everything Mr Rosso

896
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,968
You should know killing is easier than you think

897
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:32,160
You just have to forget how sweet the sugar is
