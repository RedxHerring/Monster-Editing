1
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,752
No class

2
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:17,152
I want you to tell me what was the basis for the ruling the judge made in regards to the 19

3
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
CH Stuttgart case

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,392
Oh boy what is this silence why are we some kind of a monastery Mr eimer

5
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
I'd like to hear your answer if you have one

6
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
Well sir that is to say I anyone is there anyone

7
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,520
This room who can break this silence

8
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,968
So The Chronic light coming is here at last

9
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,528
You're 13 minutes tardy

10
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:58,624
Send your part-time pizza delivery job kept you off late busy today

11
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,696
I'm sorry Professor chronic

12
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
Let me ask you a question before you sit down do you have enough strength left to tell me the basis for the ruling

13
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
1968 Stuttgart case

14
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
Well

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
The defense claim

16
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,384
But the kidnapping was a sham

17
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,200
And the victim's death had been to the poisoning

18
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,832
After an investigation into the crime scene it was found that the victim's death had been accidental

19
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
And that there was no motive

20
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
So

21
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,464
Since the crime couldn't be proven to be an intentional murder

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,536
I believe a sentence of 15 years was handed down

23
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
Very good

24
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,472
You can take your seat Nina for tonight

25
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
Yes professor

26
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
Wow good job Nina

27
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
If no one had been able to give him the answer I have no doubt that kronecker would have probably demanded we ride a 50-page report

28
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
50 pages if we were lucky

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
I'll have to treat Our Savior Nina to something to eat

30
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,568
What are you say Nina a nice meal Just the Two of Us

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,688
Oh I'm sorry Peter but I have a club meeting today bye

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,344
She turned you down again hey Peter how many times was that

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,744
Come on shut up as if one of you losers could actually score date with her

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
I give

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
Oh my gosh if I'm late with my deliveries the manager is going to be furious

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,072
Hi I'm home

37
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:21,472
Boy am I hungry oh my the neighbors can probably hear you you are such a child go

38
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
Wash your hands de

39
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
Yes ma'am

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
Hey Mom you dyed your hair

41
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
What do you think

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
At your age

43
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
I don't think you should be dying your hair such a bright color

44
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,832
I don't agree with you dad I think mom looks great

45
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,392
Looks like she's going to some costume parade

46
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
It's nice to know mom is still young

47
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
Hi Dad

48
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:51,936
Oh and that reminds me speaking of costumes I saw some kids dressed up from head to toe today

49
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,520
Oh yes today is supposed to be the same Hadrian costume parade

50
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:01,664
I wish I had dressed up like that when I was a little girl they were so adorable

51
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
Yeah you did dress up in a costume once

52
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:11,136
Isn't that right dear that's right I completely forgotten really

53
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
Let's see it's around here

54
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,791
Oh look here it is you are so cute

55
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Yes I did

56
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
You are so excited and made such a fuss

57
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,055
Isn't that right dear yeah I remember

58
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
Costume parade

59
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
Distance spring

60
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,631
I forlornly wait for a spring that will never come

61
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Hannah

62
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
When you get over your break up already

63
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,431
I shall send you the most beautiful flowers

64
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,503
I was born to smother you with flowers

65
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
That's so beautiful

66
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Wow

67
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
I wonder who sent this

68
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,767
I'm very impressed with you Peter

69
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
So

70
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
How have you been Nina

71
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Well

72
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,423
I've been very well lately Dr guid

73
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
That's good to hear

74
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,591
But of course I could tell just by the look on your face when you came into this session that you were doing well

75
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
So

76
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,199
Tell me are you still having that nightmare

77
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,527
The one about the monster emerging from the darkness

78
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
No

79
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,647
I've been sleeping very well I've been so busy I don't have time to dream

80
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,487
I wonder why I was plagued by such a dream night after night

81
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,815
It's common for students to feel fear and anxiety

82
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,655
Expectations of the future mix up with other insecurities

83
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,239
People end up confused losing sight of who they are

84
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,615
But who you are is something you can spend your whole life trying to grasp and never figure out completely

85
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,943
We're always projecting and trying to look into the future

86
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,783
We spend our whole lives looking for the answers and we do the best we can

87
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,831
Right and that's what I'm doing

88
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,135
I want to become a federal prosecutor

89
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
That's very good

90
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,487
All right I think that brings us to the end of our session

91
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
Bye and thank you doctor

92
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Nina fortun

93
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
Such a cheerful girl

94
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
I can't help thinking that she's overcompensating or running from something overwhelmingly dark

95
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
What do you mean what

96
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,903
Don't act so innocent what in the world are you going on about

97
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
I was born to smother you with flowers

98
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,375
I would never have guessed in a million years you had such talent for writing poetry I don't know what you're talking about

99
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:06,495
I wouldn't be able to come up with really stuff like that even if I stood on my head

100
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
Then who was it

101
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,127
I only give my email address to friends and no one else

102
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Beats me

103
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
Damn it what this means is some Suave poetry guys honing in on my girl

104
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
How could it be

105
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,047
This was a bizarre murder that took place in Munich

106
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
After shooting the parents to death

107
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,191
The perpetrators strangled there to children with a rope

108
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Grizzly really

109
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
No

110
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
I would like you to explain the verdict

111
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,895
Using the records from all of the hearings

112
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
Nina fortun

113
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,087
What do you not understand the question

114
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
No

115
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
The trial was focused mainly

116
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
On the cold-blooded murder of an entire family

117
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
The evidence so not even Nina

118
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:17,919
Has all the answers huh

119
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:24,319
Nina and what's wrong Nina

120
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Are you all right

121
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
You want to go see the nurse

122
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
I'm all right

123
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
I just felt a little ill that's all

124
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
I was just

125
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
Listening to the professor

126
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,311
You mean that question about that murdered family

127
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
Is that it

128
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
I thought you were awfully brave but I guess

129
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
You're pretty sensitive too

130
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,111
Did you watch a horror movie that totally scared you when you were a kid or something

131
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,695
I know exactly what that counselor Dr guidel would say

132
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,023
If you get back to the root of it I think that you'll find

133
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,095
It was nothing significant now go back to your childhood

134
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
Am I right

135
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
That's it

136
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
I have no memories

137
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
I remember nothing before the age of 10

138
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,583
Where are my memories

139
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
My childhood memories

140
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Yes

141
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,551
Those two were indeed a very nice couple

142
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
To think that they died in such a way

143
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Children

144
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,071
Now that you mentioned it yes there was a son his name was Michael I do believe

145
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
He was there for a year or two

146
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
Let's see a boy

147
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Do you remember if there was a boy

148
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Yes there was

149
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,335
Wasn't his name Michael he was 14 give or take

150
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
Michael you say

151
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
Yeah I think I remember him

152
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
But

153
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Why

154
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
Who are you the police

155
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
Michael Redman

156
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,415
I remember him vaguely but he was a student in my classroom

157
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:43,583
He didn't leave much of an impression I'm embarrassed to say it but honestly I don't remember him very well

158
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
I'm not sure if he had any friends

159
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,727
You see there are no records left from then

160
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,311
Everything went up in a fire about 6 years ago now

161
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,991
There definitely was a boy named Michael living here

162
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,391
And Michael's real name is

163
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,791
You hun huh yes there was a time when I went by that name

164
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:20,191
Are you what does it matter what's the use he's a serial killer

165
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,591
In order of twin siblings that's all there is to it nothing else

166
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,431
What am I doing

167
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,343
Twins

168
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
Where did his twin sister go I will pick you up very soon

169
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Who is this

170
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
A child

171
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,959
Oh yes there was a boy about 7 or 8 years ago and Mrs hyena had taken a boy

172
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
In before they were killed

173
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
And what was he like

174
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
What was he like

175
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
That was quite a long time ago

176
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,711
And I think he only really lived with them for about a year or so

177
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:10,111
I honestly don't remember anything about him wait do you remember if this boy had a sister no only

178
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,511
Me the boy listen I just want to forget about what happened to that poor couple after all those horrible things happened

179
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
I almost moved away

180
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
I remember that boy very well

181
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
Why don't you come up

182
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
I was about to have some tea

183
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
Come in have a seat

184
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
Yes thank you

185
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,767
I was wondering just have a seat

186
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
Go ahead absentee

187
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
Thank you sir

188
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
You're a doctor right

189
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
That boy was the one who told me you are a doctor Tenma

190
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,663
He's coming to pick you up

191
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,735
Who is he I have no idea who he is

192
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
It was just an anonymous email

193
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
Aw you look so happy

194
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:50,719
You're not thinking this is Prince Charming on a white charger or a knight in shining armor coming for you are you

195
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
Why are you jealous

196
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,095
There you go Nina daydreaming again

197
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,935
It said I was born to smother you with flowers

198
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
Come on that's so corny how many boys do you know who write like that

199
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
Hold on wait

200
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,663
There is a new guy in our class you know who I'm talking about

201
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
Oh I've seen him

202
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,343
He's the guy who sits quietly in that legendary Seton room 12 where you're bound to be called by the instructor

203
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,951
But strangely enough he's never called on that's right and you want to know what else

204
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,535
He is always staring at Nina the entire class

205
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
He's the one what do you mean

206
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,167
Come on you know Prince Charming who else

207
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,383
All I know is that boy was extremely grateful to you yes Dr tema

208
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,503
He told me more than once it because you saved his life you meant more to him than his parents

209
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,807
What name did he go by then

210
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
Fronts

211
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,903
Then what he did tell me it wasn't his real name

212
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,279
If he opened up enough to tell you that much it means he must have really trusted you

213
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,423
He just showed up one day out of nowhere really

214
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,519
Mr and Mrs heinek who lived across the hall took him in

215
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
He lived with him for about a year

216
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
No actually it was it was a 14 months to be precise from March

217
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,319
1987 to April 1988

218
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,903
And then one day out of the blue he suddenly vanished it

219
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,975
It really was very bright that boy

220
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
Very well mannered

221
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
Did he visit you in your apartment very often

222
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Everyday

223
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,703
I live alone so I always welcome to company

224
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
He said in that chair

225
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
And would spend most of his time studying

226
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,455
He was able to master the English and French that I taught him in no time

227
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,575
By the time he disappeared he was completely fluent in both languages

228
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,391
He was only 12 years old

229
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,535
Can you tell me if there's anything else you remember about him anything

230
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,607
You like my War Stories War Stories

231
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
During World War II

232
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
I was on the crew of a U-Boat the boy's favorite store it was about the time we

233
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,895
Attacked by a destroyer of the Allied Forces

234
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
We were the depth of 120 M that's when we were attacked by the enemy we had suffered

235
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
We just kept going we all waited and tears inside that creaking boat enduring

236
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
An hour after hour

237
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,375
We had to endure that hell for the day and a half

238
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,287
Any ordinary child would have probably looked at this as another adventure story

239
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,687
That boy was different what he was most interested in was my description of

240
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
Sia yes ultimate fear that reaction of people on the verge of death

241
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:03,487
Fascinated him that was all he was interested in he toyed with fear

242
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,887
So

243
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:16,287
What was the expression on his face as he listened he probably had a dream in his eye

244
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,687
Smile I imagine imagine well I cannot see Dr timma

245
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087
So no I don't know the boys real name nor obviously do I have any idea

246
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:35,487
Looks like for that matter earlier you suggested the boy trusted me because he told me

247
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:41,887
Wasn't his real name I can assure you that he doesn't trust anyone there's only one

248
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,287
Always trusted in his life and that's his sister listen I need to help

249
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:54,687
Looking for that sister he said he would go get her when she turns 20

250
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,551
In Heidelberg

251
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
See you later

252
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,927
Be careful on your scooter honey

253
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
I will

254
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Bye see you later Daddy

255
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
And drive safely okay

256
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
The time has come

257
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Has

258
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
I know

259
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:35,135
Hold on a second I'm not sure I can do this what are you talking about you wanted to

260
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:41,535
Don't mess it up you're about to meet Prince Charming

261
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,935
Later wait Clara

262
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,335
How could they do this behind my back

263
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,735
It's him here we go

264
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,535
Hi how do you do your Nina Fortuner right oh good

265
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
Yeah my name is out of huberman

266
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,167
Can you hear me

267
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,895
And you've been wearing that same shirt for half a week

268
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,271
Quit nagging me will you

269
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
You have a visitor in the reception area

270
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
All right I'm going home

271
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:16,511
Listen you're going to have to make your own coffee okay

272
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,119
He hasn't had a bath either you'll like him he smells almost as bad as you do

273
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,679
Give it a rest

274
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
Yeah well whatever

275
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,591
Whose fault is it that I haven't been able to take a bath anyway

276
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,503
She's completely oblivious to the fact that it's cuz of me that we all still have work

277
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,063
Work even though this paper has no future

278
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
No hard is that to figure out

279
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
Sorry to keep you waiting

280
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,535
Hello my name is Tim masser

281
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
And I've come here to ask you for your help

282
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
She was right

283
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
He certainly looks filthy

284
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,287
I see so you're a doctor huh

285
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
Well you don't look like one

286
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
Let me get this straight

287
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,455
I just want to make sure that we're on the same page here

288
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,111
So what you're saying is that the infamous serial killer who's been executing middle-aged couples throughout Germany has his next Target

289
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Heidelberg

290
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
This particular couple haven't adopted daughter and you're saying that when that girl turns 20 the killer will come to

291
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Take her away

292
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,888
And when he does show up the foster parents are going to be killed

293
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,800
And you have no idea who that girl or her parents are but you want to save them

294
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
If that's not delusional I don't know what is I'm not joking

295
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
About this you have to believe me

296
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
What a load of hooey

297
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
Not even a third rate tabloid would buy that story look I didn't come here to sell you a story after the

298
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
Twins Escape they disappeared

299
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,704
It was at least 6 months that went by before the brother was seen in Munich so what's your point huh I

300
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,288
Believe that after leaving the hospital those children must have come here

301
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,128
To Heidelberg together you know this is just your theory

302
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
And then the two of them were raised by the twin sisters current foster parents but the brother ran away from home after

303
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,344
Short period leaving the sister behind

304
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,904
Why don't you write a novel

305
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:25,024
Probably won't sell though wait maybe the couple reported a missing child with the police

306
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,864
Or there might be a newspaper article about it from 9 years ago

307
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:34,240
All I'm asking is to look through your archives from the past 9 years I'm begging you

308
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
Wait please

309
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,712
There mustn't be any more victims The Killing has to stop

310
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
Listen to me

311
00:22:53,952 --> 00:23:00,096
The boss is allergic to technology

312
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:06,496
Reduced versions as well as the original archives from 9 years ago

313
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,104
And the rest of these are the articles that never did make it to print

314
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,504
Thank you very much so said some sort of Japanese bow

315
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,904
Well domo arigato let me say this this doesn't mean that I believe you I just don't have time

316
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,304
Listen show yourself out when you're done looking you got that

317
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,704
God why do I always have to deal with the weirdos

318
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,104
Please please let me find it

319
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
Good morning Nina

320
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,088
Good morning

321
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:59,488
You're looking much better I'm so glad I was really scared when you fainted like that you know I guess

322
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
I really didn't like the boy we hooked you up with huh no that's not it at all I just felt sick all of a

323
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,032
I need to apologize to him I'll never mind you don't have to worry about him trust me

324
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
I found out he wasn't your prince charming on a white horse after all yeah we asked

325
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,016
And he said he didn't know anything at all about those email messages

326
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Really

327
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:30,464
So you're saying that you fainted right after you saw this particular boy at your campus huh

328
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
Well what did this fellow look like

329
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,888
I only saw him for a second so I'm not really sure

330
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,472
And do you remember exactly what you felt at the moment when you saw him

331
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,544
I remember I felt nostalgic

332
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
Maybe not

333
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
I don't know

334
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,456
How to explain it

335
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
Go on

336
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,720
Just take it easy Don't force yourself

337
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
Absolute evil

338
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
I don't know how to put it but

339
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,192
It felt just like when I used to have that nightmare

340
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,336
Absolute evil eh it sounds more like it has to do with your religious beliefs

341
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,176
I don't think so I'm not really want to go to church regularly

342
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,040
I think if I see this young man again it might help to clarify things for me

343
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,136
You're thinking this might help you recover your memory is that it

344
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,232
I suppose that's one way to go about it

345
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,072
But I don't think you should allow this to disturb the peace you now have

346
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:43,168
It's important you continue to focus on your future and the road ahead

347
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
Don't worry

348
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,592
Just work up a sweat doing your Aikido and your anxiety should disappear

349
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,552
Hey mower so did you pull another all nighter

350
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,856
Yeah by the way

351
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,976
I'm just wondering were you the one who told that person he could use the file room

352
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
That weird guy

353
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
Yeah

354
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
I asked him what he was doing there and he said you would give him permission to look through the archives well you mean he's still in there

355
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,848
Hey you time to hit the road

356
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
Hey

357
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
Are you all right

358
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
Come on heat up

359
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
Thank you

360
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
Good isn't it

361
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
I always come here for breakfast

362
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,920
So don't you ever eat at home then

363
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
What about your family

364
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,736
Haven't got one

365
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,064
My wife walked out on me a while ago

366
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,464
I was always too busy with the work and before I knew it my wife left with our daughter and moved back with her parents

367
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,096
Do you ever think about trying to patch things up with her

368
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,752
Why would I do that she's the one who walked out on me why should I have to be the one to go after her

369
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,104
Well it just seems like you regretted spending so much time at work

370
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
That's complete nonsense

371
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,064
Work is priority number one you hear any woman who can't understand such a simple fact is welcome to leave whenever she wants

372
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
Sorry about that I didn't mean to pry

373
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
That's right

374
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
None of your business

375
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,256
Oh another thing please do forgive me

376
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:50,656
But you smoke too much as a doctor I recommend you cut back I told you already it's none of your business you're

377
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
Beginning to sound just like that wife of mine

378
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,544
Well what's so bad about that it means she cares about your health

379
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,480
Just mind your own damn business

380
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
Is that Nina's birthday present

381
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,904
Yes I was finally able to finish it

382
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,000
Goodness I remember when her sweaters used to be this tiny

383
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,328
Honey do we really have to tell her

384
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,888
Why not just leave it alone

385
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
You're right

386
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,032
There's no point in telling her that now

387
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,080
Nina's our daughter

388
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
That's all there is to it

389
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,944
I'm home

390
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
Welcome back

391
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,040
I am so hungry

392
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,024
All I have to do is focus on my future yeah maybe Dr guidel is right after all

393
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,832
See you tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. at Heidelberg Castle for your birthday

Staring at newspaper clippings with you for 2 days

396
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
I admire your gumption but

397
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
Don't you think it's about time you gave up

398
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
Hey Doc

399
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920

And I say if

401
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,296
I were to ask my wife to come home again

402
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,624
Do you really think she would give it another go

403
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
If you kick the habit one day

404
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
What is it

405
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
Found it

406
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:06,592
11-year-old boy goes missing there's a possibility the child has been abducted but there have been no Ransom

407
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:12,992
Man's made as of yet address 16 Necker Street someone named Fortuner filed a missing person

408
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:18,880

413
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928

00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
I just finished up at work

416
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,072

417
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,144

418
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168

420
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
Was that Nina dear

421

422
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,920
She's meeting a friend before coming home

423
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,968
I'm wondering who this friend is

424
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,528
Nina's a big girl now

425
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,856
Maybe this will help me

426
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
To remember things

427
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,792
I want to know

428
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
Well I really am

429
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:38,752
So dark what are you going to do if this girl is at the fortuner's residence whatever's going

430
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:45,152
Going on one thing's for sure they're in danger so I'll call the police and see if they can send over a car

431
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
And you think the police are just going to show up relax nothing's happened yet doctor but if we wait till then

432
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:57,952
And it'll be too late look nothing's going to happen come on this is all in your head

433
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
Hey Duck listen up I know what I'm talking about I actually went to the crime scene of the fourth middle-aged couple murdered

434
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:10,752
Cone there was something unusual about those crimes no motive

435
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:17,152
No Vengeance no bitterness nothing yeah it just seemed like whoever did this

436
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:23,552
Where to kill for killing sake I've been a reporter for a long time something tells me

437
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:29,952
Pay off base this time around duck honestly do you really think a 20 year old kid could be such a cold-blooded

438
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:36,352
Killer there's no way a kid would do something like that it's something a whole lot worse

439
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:42,752
How could it be any worse hell that's just it I have a hard time finding the words

440
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:49,152
Describe that case

441
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:55,552
Whenever I tried to describe it the whole thing just sounds so corny but the truth is how was the devil's work

442
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,952
One thing's for certain doc if I had half a chance I'd snuff that guy

443
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:08,352

It was me I was the one who brought your brother back to life

527
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:05,247
Instead the phone line has been cut we're getting out

529

00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,367
Good Lord

535
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,903

00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:59,519
They'll take care of the crime scene and we'll take you over to headquarters for questioning so we can file a report on this

541
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,663
So are you the daughter of the victims

00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,855
I'm sorry for your loss

543
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:20,255
I'm assuming neither of you saw the Intruder then

544
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:26,655
To think something like that could happen in such a peaceful town

545
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:33,055
Pardon my asking sir but where do you come from are you Chinese and no sir I'm Japanese my name is Kenzo tema

Can you tell me where we're headed officer the police station remember but wait I don't understand

553
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:24,255
But who could have called the

554
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:30,655
There were no Sirens when they first came

555
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:37,055
And they took us away before making sure the backup arrived at the scene but

556
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:43,455
Those badges those badges did look real

557
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,855
Excuse me

558
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
Police checkpoint

00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631

568
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:50,527
Say detective what's up are these two in some kind of trouble

569
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,343
Trouble not at all it's nothing don't worry

570
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
What's going on here

571
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,719
I seem like real detectives

572
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
What about that blood

573
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
Who could have called them

574
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,399
There's Sirens weren't even on

575
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
What should we do

576
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,127
Hey what's wrong Dr Tina are you two okay

577
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,951
How do you know who I am

578
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,119
I found a grocery store nearby

579
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,423
I also got you some dry clothes

580
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,727
There's bread sausage and cheese

581
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,799
And I feel this thermos up with hot coffee too

582
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,479
You probably don't have much of an appetite but you really should eat

583
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,279
You're shivering

584
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,583
You should change out of those wet clothes

585
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
A

586
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
People were dead

587
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,991
My brother and I

588
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,015
We're walking

589
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
It was like

590
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,903
We are all alone in the world

591
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,791
Where were you when all of this happened can you remember anything else

592
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
We crossed the border

593
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,423
Uncle and auntie helped

594
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,983
They were so kind to

595
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,311
And my brother said

596
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,615
I have a good plan

597
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
Soon after that

598
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,807
My uncle and my dear auntie were both

599
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,927
Anyone who is ever good to us died

600
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
Without fail

601
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,023
All of them

602
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,327
But then one day

603
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,631
One day I discovered the reason why

604
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,935
Rainy day

605
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,007
You're talking about the incident with Mr and Mrs Liebert

606
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,079
My brother did it he shut them

607
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,383
My brother

608
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,919
He murdered them

609
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:05,855
He's the one who did all this my brother murdered them all

610
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,767
So I picked up the gun with both my hand

611
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,095
And then I I aimed it right at my brother

612
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,655
And that's when he

613
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,703
He was smiling

614
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,359
After you shoot me make sure that you throw the gun out the window

615
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,431
And he told me to aim for his head

616
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,271
So

617
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,319
I shot him like he said

618
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,903
I aim for his head like he told me

619
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,463
Why did you save him

620
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:55,263
If you hadn't saved your mom and dad would still be alive and wouldn't

621
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:01,663
Why did you have to say that

622
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,135
Stay here I'm going to the police

623
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,463
If those detectives last night were real

624
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,863
It means that some members of the police force are linked to Gohan if so we can't just wait

625
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Wait here like this

626
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:30,847
Nina I need you to listen to me I know that Johan is going to come after you if anyone comes

627
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,407
I was looking for you just hide

628
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,575
Why don't you have some food drink some hot coffee and then try to get a couple hours of rest

629
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:44,159
One step at a time that's how we'll get through all this

630
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:50,559
You're alive you must think about the future

631
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,607
Your future

632
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:59,007
Were there any clues left by the Killer is there any connection to the serial murders through

633
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:05,407
About Germany like I said we're doing everything we can to investigate this case but I can't

634
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:11,807
And make any comments or talk about details

635
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:18,207
This time or is she presumed dead as well we're trying to figure out her whereabouts why was that newspaper reporter with them Mr Ma

636
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:31,007
Who is it he sounds suspicious quick question Chief is this murder at all related to the one that took place

637
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:37,407
I said Heidelberg Castle around the same time so he was killing joke that's

638
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:43,807
It's all for now we'll release additional details in due time

639
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:50,207
Do you like one more question excuse me sir of course we

What I can't hear you we're really busy in here

645
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:31,423
Just final Japanese

646
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:37,823
I'm bringing an important witness to your office at

647
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,591
5:00

648
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:43,455
But you must not tell the police

649
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,479
Hello

650
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,831
If I can't trust the police only they can help Nina now

651
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,255
Western power

652
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:01,887
I'm sorry but you just can't come in here without permission he's right

653
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:06,239
Besides the bka is only working on the serial murders of the middle-aged couples

654
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:10,591
All that you're going to find in this room is material for the murder of the castle inspector long gay

655
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,127
Sir

656
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,455
Please forgive me

657
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,599
I was just a bit curious but the crime you're investigating in this one happened at the same time Detective

658
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,647
I mean it couldn't have been the same murder

659
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,183
So I see

660
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,255
It appears that this man had been tied up

661
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:32,351
You didn't happen to find a rope or anything nearby did you

662
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,375
No

663
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,727
Seems the body had already been untied by the time the police arrived on the scene

664
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
I see

665
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
Yes

666
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,743
There are four possible routes of Escape From The Scene he also had to stay well out of sight

667
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:06,143
How crowded was the area where he'd come out and how much light was there

668
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,743
Here it is

669
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:38,143
Nina it's me Tema I'm back Nina you can come out now

670
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:42,751
It's all right hey Nina

671
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
Oh no

672
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
Nina

673
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,943
Nina

674
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,991
Where are you

675
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,551

676
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,511
He came for you

677
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,559
Disney Nina

678
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,167
I never should have left you here all alone

679
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:36,255
Doctor tena

680
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:41,119
I don't blame you for saving my brother's life anymore

681
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,447
You did what you had to do as a doctor

682
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
It wasn't your fault

683
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,287
Please eat the sandwiches

684
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,615
Get some rest too

685
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
Please live on

686
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:59,039
And continue to save as many people as you are able to

687
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,855
Nina Fortner

688
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,663
Nina what are you planning to do are you going to kill

689
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:32,063
Your brother second time I did it I brought him back

690
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:38,463
Back to life that monster it was me

691
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,303
I brought him back to life

692
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:56,127
There are a lot of blood vessels in this arterial venous malformation

693
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,687
Cutting all arteries

694
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,991
And now the veins

695
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,855
Extraction of the night is just complete

696
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,191
That went very well yes as usual

697
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,983
He's remarkably quick with the clipping

698
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,775
An amazing operation

699
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:30,431
Doctor Tema how is it possible that even after a long break the work of a genius like you only gets better and better

700
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,991
It's over

701
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,367
Never mind it is an important

702
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:23,679
You better make me happy Kenzo cuz hardship doesn't suit

703
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,215
Please

704
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,519
Sir Madam is resting at the moment

705
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,799
I won't need much

706
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,847
Overtime this shouldn't take

707
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,199
You really need to make an appointment with Madam

708
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,503
What's all the racket

709
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,831
I'm terribly sorry to bother you mad

710
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,903
But there's a police officer here

711
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,487
Miss Ava Heine

712
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,535
It's been a while hasn't it

713
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,839
And how are you supposed to be

714
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,887
I worked on your father's case

715
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,935
Exactly nine years ago

716
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,751
I'm inspector Lungi of the bka

717
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,799
Loon gay

718
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,847
Oh I see

719
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,663
You may leave us holes

720
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:44,575
I do remember you all too well

721
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:54,815
And you were that good for nothing detective you couldn't even close my father's case so tell me what on Earth do you want from me now

722
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,351
I'm quite impressed

723
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:01,215
You've been able to maintain this residence exactly the same even after your father's death

724
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:06,591
Actually it appears that the decor might have gotten even more extravagant than before

725
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:13,247
So then if you come to see how much money I've made from The Inheritance my father left me and all my divorce settlements

726
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:18,623
As you can see detective I live in Absolute Comfort

727
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:23,743
If you see anything you like please feel free to take it with you

728
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:29,375
As long as I have my liquor by my side I'm fine

729
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:33,727
I've come today because there is something I'd like to show you

730
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,543
Here take a look at this necktie

731
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,871
A necktie does it look familiar

732
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,943
Perhaps you don't remember

733
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,503
It's a design from 9 years ago

734
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,807
It has a very simple print

735
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,855
But if you look at it carefully

736
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
It's a Wonderful piece

737
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,951
With an extremely elaborate weave

738
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,023
So what what about it

739
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:01,631
Tracing it back was quite a task after all it was purchased 9 years ago

740
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:08,287
But luckily this was a limited edition offering especially made for a particular stores higher-end

741
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Science

742
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,383
And your name was on that list Miss Ava Heine

743
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,735
So what exactly is your point

744
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,503
You see

745
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:21,599
I was wondering if you might have purchased this and given it to someone as a gift

746
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:26,207
This necktie is a key piece of evidence and another murder case

747
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,255
A murder

748
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,911
Who knows

749
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:40,031
I've given gifts to so many men I couldn't possibly keep track of them all now could I

750
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:45,407
They're not interested in me anyway the only thing thereafter is my money

751
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,711
Please try to remember

752
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:53,343
I told you I don't remember these men are all after my money

753
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,183
There isn't a single person who truly loves me for who I am

754
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:03,583
That's why I always stick it to them when it's time for the divorce settlement I did not tell all three of them

755
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
Damn Bast

756
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,167
Do you want something too

757
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,447
You want something

758
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
Just tell me

759
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,287
Michelle pay a high price for it

760
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,383
I'll be back ma'am

761
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,455
If you remember anything please give me a call

762
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:23,551
Next time you stop by detective be sure to bring me something to drink

763
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
Excuse me

764
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:15,519
Dr Norton you're looking very handsome this evening thank you you're looking especially beautiful tonight

765
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:34,719
House have my car ready

766
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:42,655
Well Mr Hess you're certainly looking better today

767
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:47,007
At this rate I'm guessing you should be able to go home sometime later this week all right

768
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:50,335
Thank you very much Dr Timmy you did a great job

769
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:56,735
By the way my daughter is getting married next month do you think I'll be able to attend her wedding yes that should be fine

770
01:05:56,991 --> 01:06:00,575
You just have to promise me that you won't get too wild at the reception

771
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,367
Thanks doctor

772
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,903
I had resigned myself

773
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,975
To not going but thanks to you

774
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,791
Hey come on it's because you toughed it out

775
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:15,423
With you looking after me I feel as though I'll even live to see my grandchildren get married

776
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:22,591
You truly are a wonderful doctor I really hope they keep you with this Hospital forever

777
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,687
Excuse me Dr tema

778
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,967
You have a visitor

779
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:32,831
Oh I'm doing my rounds right now tell them I'm too busy at the moment would you please

780
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,111
Okay but

781
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,959
It's been a while hasn't it Kenzo

782
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,007
That ass

783
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,103
Both of us

784
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,151
Have gone through so much

785
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,295
You look worn out you're much thinner

786
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,575
I guess

787
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,391
I hear that you took some vacation time

788
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,487
Well I think that's great you should take a break every once in awhile

789
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,791
He always wore such a workaholic

790
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,887
Seems like you've lost a little wait yourself

791
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,983
I've had a rough couple of years

792
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,287
I'm sure you've heard all the rumors

793
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
I've heard a few

794
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,063
Spring

795
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,599
You remember

796
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:42,463
Almost 10 years ago how the two of us would often go out for a drive

797
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,255
We were so young

798
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:48,607
It was this time of the year when you tried to swim in that River

799
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,167
I panicked and tried to stop you

800
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,263
But you insisted and you just

801
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,431
Luck Eva I can't deal with this now

802
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,967
Cancel

803
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,063
I want to start over

804
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:14,463
After three failed marriages I finally realized

805
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,535
That the only one who ever truly loved me

806
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,559
Was you

807
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,607
It was you Kenzo

808
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,447
That was a long time ago

809
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:35,199
Please cancel

810
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:39,807
I want you to know that I'm very flattered Ava but there's no going back

811
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
Goodbye

812
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:47,231
Please cancel I kept quiet I didn't say a word the police came to my house and asked about your time

813
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:53,631
It seems to me that necktie of yours has gotten you in some kind of trouble I'm

814
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:57,215
Absolutely positive that's the one I gave you as a gift when we were together

815
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:01,567
If you do as I say I'll keep quiet about it I promise you

816
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,967
There's something very important that only I can accomplish

817
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:33,567
I'll tell the police about your time I'll tell them everything

818
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:39,967
You hear me I'll tell them how you killed my father 9 years ago you killed him

819
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,927
Oh I see

820
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:55,327
Let's bring Dr 10 my in for an interrogation right away

821
01:09:55,583 --> 01:10:01,727
That's not what I'm referring to I'm talking about the killing at

822
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:08,127
Cooper Castle thank you very much for your Cooper

823
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:14,527
This could prove to be very helpful in solving several of our open cases

824
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,879
Resignation

825
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,695
But what is the meaning of this doctor ten

826
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:25,791
I'm very sorry director but I've already made up my mind about this

827
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:32,447
There have been various odd rumors going around about you recently but I want to be clear I don't believe

828
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
Leave any of

829
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,007
Please think this over you

830
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,103
Hey wait

831
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,151

Excuse me the police

01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:53,599
Get out of the way you people are interfering with the police like hell doctor would never be capable of killing anyone

839
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:06,399
Anything wrong though go to jail he would never do anything like that

840
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:12,799
Who is this

841
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:19,199

Why are you all bundled up on a hot summer day like this aren't you broiling huh you're reading an old paper
