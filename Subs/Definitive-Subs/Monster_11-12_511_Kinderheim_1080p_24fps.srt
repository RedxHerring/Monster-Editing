1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:05,888
Well Well you certainly have found an excellent piece of property

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:12,288
It's only a 20 minute drive to the center of Berlin perfectly situated in a convenient

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,568
Lovely neighborhood

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:19,712
It's rare to find a unique property of such caliber especially on the east side

5
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
I Can Only Imagine

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
If I'm not mistaken wasn't this the residence of Mr Liebert the former head of Commerce of East Germany

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,328
You Don't Know Her buyer you just came to investigate Mr Liebert is that all

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,936
Please forgive me but I just need some information

9
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,312
I don't know anything about an official who died almost 10 years ago

10
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
Apparently Mr Liebert and his wife adopted fraternal twins during the time that they were here I told you I don't know

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,528
Anything well who owns the property

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Can you direct me to them

13
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Listen a lot of the property in former East Germany used to be owned by Jews who had to flee during the Nazi regime

14
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,120
In some cases the government ended up borrowing land from people on the west side or in other countries

15
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,704
The owner of this property is overseas besides

16
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:18,336
My company is a Westside real estate firm that entered the Eastern Market after the wall hell

17
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,944
We don't know anything about the past now if you could please hurry and leave I'm locking up

18
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,504
Isn't there anyone who might remember

19
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,320
Could there possibly be someone who knew the lieberts

20
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:33,696
It's like I already told you this was a residential area where many high-ranking officials live

21
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:39,840
Most of them fled soon after the wall came down especially the officials from the ministry of the interior

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
Come to think of it

23
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:49,824
An ex-official from the East German Department of Commerce lives about 10 houses away

24
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah I remember Mr Liebert

25
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
I'll never understand why you decided to take such a risk if only he had waited just a little longer until East German

26
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Collapsed

27
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,928
It makes you wonder why you went to a free country only to be killed in the end

28
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
It's a damn shame really

29
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
Do you remember if Mr Liebert had children twins perhaps did he have twins you say

30
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
Oh yes that's right

31
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,288
Mr Liebert adopted those twins from The Orphanage

32
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
Are you sure

33
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
That's right those two are such cute kids

34
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,456
Mr Liebert always did talk about wanting children

35
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
Which orphanage was it

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
Which one was it

37
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
511

38
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,744
Yes that's right I believe they came from 511 kinderheim

39
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
I'm sorry

40
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
511 kinderheim

41
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:28,191
They're planning on turning this old orphanage into a supermarket sometime soon

42
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:34,079
About time thank goodness they're finally going to destroy this creepy building

43
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,735
Excuse me ma'am by any chance do you know anyone from this place

44
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
The orphanage

45
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
Everyone from there is long since gone

46
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,183
I really prefer not to talk about it

47
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
It was such a tragedy

48
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
But if you want to find out more about it

49
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
There's a former official from the old Ministry of welfare named Hartman over on 47th Street

50
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Hello there

51
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,255
Do you know if a man named Hartman lives around here

52
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
Wait what's wrong you're injured

53
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
Let me take a look

54
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
Don't be afraid I'm not going to hurt you

55
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
You reinjured an old wound

56
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
It's infected but this should help

57
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Attabo

58
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,295
I know this stings but it'll help you get better

59
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
There you go all done

60
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Be careful okay

61
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
You might get hurt again

62
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
Heart mon

63
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
After the fall of East Germany

64
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,447
I became the foster parent to all those kids you see photographed up on the wall

65
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,103
Foster parent yes well it just means that I took care of them until they were adopted or eventually able to go off

66
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Up on their own

67
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,991
The boy in the middle was adopted by the president of an accessories company

68
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
And the last one on the left

69
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
Is enlisted in the army

70
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,743
I still have one left in my care right now it must be hard work for you to tell the truth I wouldn't call

71
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Work

72
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
As the district official for the ministry of welfare I worked for many years dealing with orphans and I was Adam

73
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
Currently against the way the government handled them

74
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,151
After the fall of socialism I thought I'd try doing things my own way

75
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
I couldn't do any worse

76
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,039
Of course it isn't easy and I don't have many resources

77
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,647
But it's far better than the way they were living in that orphanage if you can call it that

78
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
The ministry of the interior and the ministry of welfare ran 511 kinderheim as a special

79
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,959
Well all these German orphanages were pretty severe places to be

80
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,055
But these special orphanages

81
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
We're particularly notorious

82
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,431
It wasn't just an institution for children with nowhere to go

83
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
It was the place where children of criminals and political prisoners are suspected dissidents were sent disc

84
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:01,439
Elimination and inhumane cruelty were part of everyday life for the children there

85
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,559
Those poor unfortunates were defenseless and couldn't do anything about their situation

86
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,215
Ironically it was a contradictory clash between socialism and total

87
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
The government claim they were reeducating them to be good citizens but in actuality behind closed doors

88
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:26,527
Wasn't away from the public eye those helpless children were treated like criminals even worse than criminals

89
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,111
The director and instructors were absolutely terrible

90
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,255
The worst of the bunch would confiscate care packages sent to the children and sell them for their own profit

91
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,071
Who then were the real criminals I ask you

92
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,703
Fear and violence rule the daily lives of those poor children and those special orphanages

93
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
You can't raise normal people that way

94
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
And then one day

95
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,711
That incident happened incident what exactly do you mean by that

96
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,831
Well when you came here you said that you wanted to ask me about the twins didn't you

97
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,903
Yes that's right can you tell me anything at all about them

98
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,303
I don't know much about the girl except that she was left at an orphanage in a different District but the boy

99
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
I'll always remember the brother Johan

100
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:19,519
Johan yes please tell me whatever there is to know

101
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
What happened they kept everyone

102
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
From finding out

103
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
The East German government placed a strict gag order on it well it is in the past

104
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
Also I suppose it's all right I guess there's no harm in talking to you about the incident so what are you talking

105
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,327
Talking about I need to know

106
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
What's your hun too

107
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
I didn't uprising

108
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
I'm home

109
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Diet

110
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
We have company

111
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
Come here and say hello to him why don't you

112
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
Dieter

113
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
Where are your manners

114
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:11,743
Well are you going to greet the man or not oh it's okay we already met earlier out in front of the building

115
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
Remember

116
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
Please continue Mr Hartman

117
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
I'd like to hear more

118
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,471
No I'm sorry I can't not in front of the child

119
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Understood

120
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,359
Well it's late can we continue this another time

121
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Peter

122
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
Maybe you'd like to stay and have dinner with us

123
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
Sure if you don't mind

124
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Mr Ten

125
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:52,959
You say that you're a freelance journalist does that mean you're going to write an article about the things we've been talking about

126
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Eventually

127
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
When you do write your article

128
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
Please be sure to emphasize this

129
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,223
The moral development of a child all depends on the adult that raises him

130
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,831
It is essential that we encourage every child to follow the proper path

131
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
If we do

132
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,975
They'll be able to achieve their dreams and have a happy life

133
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Dreams

134
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Hey diet

135
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
What are your dreams

136
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
A soccer ball

137
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
I want a soccer ball

138
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799

Thank you for dinner I was hoping we could continue our conversation another time of course I am sorry

140
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
Maybe we couldn't finish it up tonight

141
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
I'll be back

142
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
Perhaps I can come by tomorrow

143
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Well did

144
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
Hello I'm sorry may I still make a purchase

145
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807

146
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
It's me Tim

147
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135

Mr Hartman Mr Hartman what's wrong please open up

149
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
Mr Hartman

150
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,215
Mr Denmark

151
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,079
Teacher what happened to him he was playing

152
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895

So hard man call an ambulance quick all right

What are all these bruises

160
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
Does this hurt

161
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
What about here

162
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
Two of your ribs are fractured

163
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
And also

164
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:43,711
Your shoulder is dislocated how did you get this injury from falling off a chair

165
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:50,111
The ambulance is on the way and should be here soon so everything's going to be all right good

166
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,463
But where these bruises come from I said everything's all right

167
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,863
You can leave now Mr tinma but your hands just now it was like you're examining him

168
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
It's as if you are a doctor well 10 Ma I thought I heard that

169
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
Somewhere before you are a doctor aren't you the one wanted for murder

170
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
These bruises just how did he get these bruises all over

171
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
You shouldn't worry about the boy you've got your own problems don't you the police

00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
What's it matter to you

175
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,031
I mean you're the one who's wanted for murder doctor

176
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
You're very short tempered just like a fugitive

177
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
You did this to him didn't you did what what do you mean you're the one who's been abusing

178
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,231
Why I'd never do such a thing to an innocent child

179
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
Right Dieter wait

180
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:12,031
What are you doing to the hospital first murder and now kidnapping

181
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
Don't move the police will catch you eventually

182
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
It's okay to

183
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:31,231
We'll be at the hospital soon I'm scared I'm scared of the hospital there's nothing to be afraid

184
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:37,631
The doctors will take good care of you but Mr Harmon is always the one who took care of me every

185
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,215
Time I got hurt before

186
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
What are you telling me

187
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,895
You're completely covered in scars and bruises and you've never been to a hospital

188
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
I'm scared

189
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,295
The world is full of bad things that's why I have to become stronger

190
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,135
If I'm going to fight all the bad things I have to become

191
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,719
Stronger is that what heart mom told you

192
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
The world is dark

193
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
The Futures bleak

194
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
And that isn't true

195
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
The world's not a dark place that's a lie

196
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
Really

197
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Yes really

198
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Oh I almost forgot

199
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
This soccer ball is for you

200
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
Tomorrow will be a good day

201
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
I promise

202
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,327
I'm sorry for coming so late thank you nurse

203
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,447
But the ER is pretty busy at the moment it might end up being a while before we can treat him

204
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
I can't move him up at all

205
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,567
There is a very big accident I'm sorry

206
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,407
So we need to ask the truck driver about the circumstances of the accident

207
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,967
You broke both his legs but he can still talk any

208
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
We have to treat him first

209
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,575
You can question him after we're done

210
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,927
All right then we'll wait right here until he's ready I see

211
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:11,327
I'll be back in 2 hours please just do what you can to take care of the boy

212
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
And whatever you do please be sure not to let anyone else take him away I will be coming back to get him

213
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:24,127
I owe you one is the accident site cleaned up yet no

214
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,527
Traffic still backed up okay what should I do now

215
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,927
First what to do with Dieter even if I call the police I can't go with him

216
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:43,327
I don't know much about the girl except that she was left at an orphan

217
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
Mention a different District

218
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
A different orphanage wait that's it

219
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,271
There's a child that you want me to take in

220
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,087
Well are you the child's parent

221
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
What are you doing coming here at this hour I'm sorry I know it's a strange request but this child needs you

222
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,815
Look I understand that the child is being abused

223
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
But if I don't know who you are then how can I

224
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:24,031
Well I I just I can't take in a child from a suspicious person who won't even identify himself

225
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Wait

226
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,175
Did Anna Liebert live here with you with this orphanage by any chance

227
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
Hold on a second

228
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
Are you saying that you know Anna Liebert

229
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
That's right

230
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
So you do remember Anna

231
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,695
Yes of course I do

232
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,023
How is Anna is she doing well for herself

233
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
Yes

234
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,887
She's currently taking classes at Heidelberg University

235
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,959
Really then I guess she's doing very well

236
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
Thought it was such a nice girl

237
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,847
I heard she was adopted by Mr Liebert of the Commerce Ministry

238
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,407
Along with her twin brother

239
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,735
What was his name again Johan

240
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:11,135
That was it his name was Johan they were truly very close I felt so sorry for them when they had to be separated but they

241
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
They had to be placed in different orphanages

242
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
Before the two of them arrived here they only had each other they were truly alone in this world

243
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,471
They were found walking hand in hand near the border of Czechoslovakia

244
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Just the two of them

245
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,919
Shivering all alone in the cold at first Mr Liebert was only going to adopt

246
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,783
Johann but Johan wouldn't go anywhere without his sister there was no separating them

247
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,391
Thankfully Anna was able to live a happy life because of her brother

248
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:49,791
I heard that the conditions and the orphanages in East Germany were pretty terrible not all orphanages were like

249
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
511 kinderheim

250
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:05,919
Anger deer the bathroom

251
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
The other way

252
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599
Down the hall okay

253
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:20,000
It's all right it's all right there's nothing to be afraid of now you can go to the bathroom by yourself

254
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,400
Can't you

255
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800
These poor children have never really felt the love of a parent in order to

256
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,128
To develop as a person the only thing you need is love

257
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:42,528
The orphanages of the East Side were truly horrible places for the children to grow up in everything was so

258
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,928
So impersonal even this place was only known by the number 47 you'd better believe we did everything

259
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:55,328
We could do within our power so that we wouldn't be controlled by the government we weren't going to be

260
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:01,728
Another 511 kinderheim it was a special orphanage controlled by the ministry of

261
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,824
Fair and the ministry of the Interior do you know what that means

262
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
No

263
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:13,760
The reality was it was a Ministry of the Interiors Pet Project East Germany was using

264
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:20,160
Thing that place for experimentation on the children

265
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
Experimentation

266
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,472
They were running a project that would turn the children into perfect soldiers

267
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,640
Mental reconstruction they made the children form factions to observe the aggression the fighting

268
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:47,040
I hate that resulted it was an experiment to claw every last bit of compassion out of those

269
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:53,440
Children and see what remained can you imagine what kind of

270
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,744
Adults those children grew up to be

271
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:01,632
And now the problem is there's no way to prove that anything like that ever went on

272
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:07,264
Any type of data or secret records all those documents were burned before the wall fell

273
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,848
Everyone who had anything at all to do with the project

274
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
Fled the country

275
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
However

276
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,504
I've heard rumors of someone who remain

277
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,296
He managed to clean his records

278
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:24,416
He stayed even though he was the last person in the world who deserved a second chance

279
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,584
He was the man who was in charge of overseeing the Abomination that was 511 kinderheim

280
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
And even though he was actually a pediatric psychiatrist closely affiliated with the ministry of the interior

281
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Police

282
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,872
The man's real title was that of a district official with the ministry of welfare

283
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
A district official

284
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,224
History of welfare

285
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,672
Inga are you all done in the bathroom

286
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
Sweet dreams honey

287
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
All right

288
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
Play

289
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
Good night

290
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,448
They were careful to cover everything up

291
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
Especially after that

292
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
Incident incident

293
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Tell me

294
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,896
I need to know what exactly happened at 511 kinderheim

295
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
I've said too much already

296
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
Such horrible

297
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,856
But I have to know you must tell me what happened there please

298
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
Where's my soccer ball

299
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
Where is it do you know where my soccer ball went to

300
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
Here you go

301
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
I have it right here

302
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,016
But you got to hold off on soccer until your wounds heal all right

303
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,856
Batman who brought you in earlier said he was going to pick you up soon

304
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,160
You just get some rest until then

305
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,048
I don't know what really happened there

306
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
No one

307
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:12,704
The East German government at the time placed a strict gag order on the event

308
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:18,336
It all began with the mysterious death of the director of 511 kinderheim

309
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:24,480
Soon after there was a power struggle among the instructors there as to who would succeed him

310
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,344
The place was thrown into Anarchy it was utter chaos

311
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,952
They couldn't even control the children it was every man for himself

312
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:40,352
It's a miracle Johan made it out of their alive then what what exactly happened at

313
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:46,752
511 kinderheim everybody there died what all of the instructors and

314
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:53,152
Every last orphan except Johan those people massacred each other

315
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:05,952
The world's not a dark place that's a lie tomorrow

316
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:12,352
I will be a good day I promise

317
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:37,952
Excuse me Mr Hartman but aren't we going to

318
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,352
Go home now no we're taking a little detour

319
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:50,752
Back there

320
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:03,552
Each other come on now be a good boy

321
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
What do you mean

322
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:22,496
I told you not to let Peter leave with anyone until I came back didn't I did was that person was the

323
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Child's Foster father

324
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,872
And let me tell you he was very much a gentleman

325
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,920
Unlike you obviously

326
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,576
Look I'm sorry but that man I wouldn't worry

327
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:43,232
That boy seemed very happy to be going with him

328
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:49,632
Dana

329
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,536
They're not back yet

330
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,240
Hartman's Library

331
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,480
These photos were taking a different times

332
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,784
But they were all shot at the same location

333
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
So what am I looking at

334
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,096
Yohan

335
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:30,752
Who's the man in the photo next to

336
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,712
Yes that's it every single one of these photographs was taken at 511 kinderheim

337
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:46,112
And it looks like they were taking over 10 years ago

338
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,696
All of the instructors and every last orphan except Johan

339
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,768
Those people massacred each other

340
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:59,168
Dita could

341
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,568
Another

342
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,880
Just hold on Peter I'm coming

343
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,608
This child is blind to what I show him

344
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
Hot mom

345
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,448
He can't see it

346
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,032
He can't even comprehend what Johan saw

347
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,336
He's not like him

348
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
It's no good it is failed again

349
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,368
This boy is no Johan

350
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:03,840
Every single one of them died here did you know that

351
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:10,240
10 years ago

352
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
The instructors and the orphans all 50 people died

353
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:23,040
Johann is not here just watching it

354
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:29,440
All happen you just sat here and watched everything

355
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:42,240
You didn't lift a finger you just watch

356
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:55,040
I had to know his secret so I ask

357
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,440
Johan what he done and this was how he answered he

358
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:07,840
The piece of oil soap cloth Into the Fire like this

359
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:19,360
Do you get it do you know what he meant by that

360
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:25,760
I simply added a bit of fuel to the hatred born when people come together

361
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
It was easy

362
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
That's what he told me

363
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,184
Only 10 years old and he said that

364
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,024
And he did it with almost no effort at all

365
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,352
He was able to make 50 people kill each other

366
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
Without even moving a finger

367
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
It was you

368
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:50,592
It was you and your damned experiments that Twisted Johann into what he is

369
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,408
So you think it was us

370
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
I'm sorry

371
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,992
It wasn't us at all

372
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
We didn't make him that way

373
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,416
It's true that 511 kinderheim was an experimental project

374
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:09,024
Specifically created to transform orphans into perfect soldiers

375
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,632
Thinking back on it now it really was only a little experiment

376
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
As for Johan

377
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
He's no Soldier

378
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
Not at all

379
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
He was better

380
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:27,456
He was a natural born leader of men someone who was meant to stand at the very top of the world

381
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:31,040
There's no way we could have ever created such a work of art

382
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,880
He was beyond human from the beginning

383
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
A veritable monster

384
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
Johann made a prediction

385
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,376
He predicted that mankind would end up hating itself into Oblivion

386
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,216
And what do you think Johan's goal was

387
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,544
Do you want to know what he told me

388
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,408
He said he wanted to be the last person left in this world

389
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
He did

390
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:12,000
My poor teacher

391
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:18,400
The future is dark you must try harder to become

392
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:24,800
More like Johan it's a pity

393
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:31,200
Why are you such a failure

394
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:37,600
Why can't you be more like your house tell me why

395
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:44,000
Drop the gun or I'll shoot don't you lay a finger on him hard man get

396
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
This is our problem it's none of your business just leave

397
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:56,800
Come down from there sorry Dr Tim that's right

398
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:03,200
You were wanting to know more about Johan what were you planning to do

399
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:09,600
When you find Johann are you going to try and kill him that will

400
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:14,464
Possible don't look so mad

401
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,864
I'm going to let you in on a little secret but in exchange once you hear it you must leave immediately

402
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,664
You

403
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
Search out a general wolf he's the one who first discovered Johann and his abilities

404
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,464
I'm sure he's still alive somewhere so is he the man in the photograph the one in your study

405
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,792
General both the man standing next to Johan

406
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:56,448
He's the one who brought Johan to us he should be able to tell you something now

407
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
Get going

408
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,104
You can come with me or stay here

409
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,920
But you have to decide for yourself

410
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:12,320
There's nothing to worry about if heart mom does anything to try and stop

411
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:18,720
If you want to shoot him

412
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:25,120
Listen to me the choices her own nobody else can make

413
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,472
For you

414
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:36,896
Go ahead tell the doctor there's no way you leave me now would you you can't live without me

415
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,224
Because you're my child teacher

416
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,880
Now you see how it is Doctor tenba

417
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
You can leave

418
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,672
Where are you going it's all right it's okay

419
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,744

420
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,656
Teacher come back here my dear little detail

421
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:37,056
You really think you can live without me no time

422
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,640
I love you so much Peter

423
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,248
The world is dark

424
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,320
The future is bleached the time

425
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,208
It's not true 10 minutes told me

426
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,768
Tomorrow will be a good day

427
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,680
Because he's wrong be brave

428
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:10,080
Don't be afraid

429
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,880
Feeders fly

430
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,504
Get on the bus here and take it to Conan Street

431
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
You got that

432
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,112
The orphanage is there by the bus stop

433
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,208
When you get there I want you to give this letter to Elna Tice

434
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,256
She runs the orphanage

435
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,072
I know she may look scary but she's a nice lady

436
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
Be a good boy okay

437
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,960
I can't stay in this town anymore

438
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,080
So I guess this is goodbye the bus will be along in a few minutes

439
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,360
Take care dear

440
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:22,272
Keep up the soccer practice

441
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:33,024
I'm sorry

442
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,560
You can't come with me

443
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,840
Here

444
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,728

00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,288

446
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
