Hey so what do you think of our boss anyway the ever mysterious Hans gay York shuval

23
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
I was looking for work and the money was good honestly that's all I

24
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
I needed to know

25
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
Are you saying you've never heard the rumors about him

26
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:47,840
He works the stock market like a marionette one phone call from him leaves Banks across Germany quaking in their boots

27
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
Of Bavaria he has no family no close friends

28
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,336
It's just him and his money his fortune keeps growing and growing every year

29
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
On Earth is he spend it on anyway

30
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Who knows

31
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,224
I didn't even get to the weird part yet

32
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,808
Other nickname is the vampire of Bavaria

33
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
How come

34
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:15,232
Just as the clock strikes 2:00 a.m. shoe volts manservant loads him into a car like

35
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
I've seen it myself

36
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
It's like something out of a horror movie

37
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
Maybe he's getting some air

38
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,495
I'll find out soon enough what else you've all up to

39
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,799
What do you mean you're going to find out

40
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
It's for my research paper silly

41
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,479
Mental activities of medieval and present-day Financial figures of Bavaria

42
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
I lucked out

43
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
So you look me up cuz he yelled at me is that it

44
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,975
Just your name and your major I'm not a snoop

45
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,047
Anyway I wouldn't lose any sleep over him chewing you out

46
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
He yells at all the guys who read to him

47
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Yeah

48
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
Well I guess it's a good thing I'm used to getting yelled at

49
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
What do you mean

50
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,127
It's just I spent a lot of time in foster homes some of them weren't so nice

51
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,735
So that's why there's no record of you in any of the local high schools

52
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,295
You looked up more than my major in name

53
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
It's got to be rough

54
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
Growing up without your real parents like that

55
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
The truth is

56
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,535
I came to Munich for school because I thought maybe I could find my mother

57
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
She's here in Munich

58
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
That's great

59
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Have you seen her yet

60
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
No

61
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,007
It wasn't meant to be

62
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
You just throw in the towel

63
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:38,175
Hey you don't happen to know your mom's name well go ahead

64
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,527
It wasn't meant to be okay

65
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
If you don't we both know I'm going to look her up anyway

66
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Mar

67
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
Her name is Margo Langer

68
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,327
Silly you have her full name and you were ready to give up like that find her

69
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
What are you waiting for

70
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679

74
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
At full stride

75
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
Passion Electric

We are reading pains me

79
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
Why didn't you explain Carl

80
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
If only I had known

81
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
Now I understand why you gave up looking

82
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
I'm so sorry for your Los

83
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015

00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,159
Carl if there's anything I can do just ask me that's sweet of you but

86

I'm fine

87
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Hey Lott

88
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,911
You said you wanted to figure out where shoe Vault goes at night

89
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
You're going to follow him right

90
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
Would you mind if I came along for the ride

91
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
No not at all

92
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,407
Sure does beat sneaking through the darkness by myself

93
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,111
I'm telling you it's true our supernatural phenomena research group is finally hit Pay Dirt

94
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
There is no way

95
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
In any case

96
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839
Listen up Bishop gropius one of the founders of our school wrote this poem in the year 1502 that much

97
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
Already know for sure

98
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
Now consider the following verse

99
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
On the second to the last big year

100
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,055
The boy of Thursday will arrive upon the land

101
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
And the book shall go up in flames

102
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,943
The entire world will be shrouded in sorrow crazy huh

103
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
So it's spooky what's your point again

104
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Don't you get it guys

00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,135
Look it says right here the second to the last big year

What year is it 1996 right

107
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
So that means this is the year

108
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
How do you figure

109
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
Listen The Big Year means leap year

110
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,191
And the only leap years left in this Century are this year and the year

111
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,543
He will arrive upon the land and the book should go up in flames

112
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,943
The part about the books in this land means that this University will go up in Flames okay then who is this

113
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Thursday huh

114
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
Thursday

115
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
Well let's see

116
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
Don't understand comes from the word donor

117
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
Yeah and donor means Thunder

118
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
The god of thunder

119
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
You lost your damn mind hey this is going to be the front page story of our next newsletter it's no laughing matter

121
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:47,359

And this is what we find out

123
00:08:54,271 --> 00:09:00,415
There he goes

00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:06,815
Okay be careful I want to see

00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,151
Hey maybe this isn't such a good idea

127
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,759
You're probably right this is no place for a girl you should go home

128
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
Only beautiful things are deserving of my love

129
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
I need to know

130
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,279

131
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679

00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:53,151
If you're looking for some fun you came knocking on the

Why does he come here to see you in the middle of the night like he does

141
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
It's simple kid I make him feel better

142
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,183
But not in the way you're thinking just cuz he's up at this hour doesn't mean he's up at this hour if you catch my

143
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
He brings me money scads of it

144
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
And why shouldn't he

145
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:50,239
When I finally went to shoe volt and told him who I was he broke down crying and apologized on the spot

146
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,103
I had his son and he threw me out on the street like I was a piece of trash

147
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
Wait so

148
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,223
Carl is she saying that you're hunchew about son

149
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
How would you know you liar

150
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
How dare you

00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,135
How dare you pretend to be Margo Langer

152
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,999
The real one was all over the papers a year ago former prostitute

153
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,887
Former prostitute Margo Langer murdered police say killer still at Large

154
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
The woman you call yourself is already dead

155
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
How could any human being stoop so low

156
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
You're using my dead mother's name to guilt shoes all that of his money and he's falling for it

157
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:35,295
Shoe ball knows the score

158
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,671
Well he knows I'm not the real thing but he still gives me money hand over fist

159
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:47,071
All the money in the world can't buy him forgiveness from the real Margo Langer that ship is sailed guess

160
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,423
I understand is the next best thing money money

161
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,983
That's all the bastards been living for

162
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,823
And the only way he knows how to say sorry

163
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,199
Don't look so terry-eyed kid you know Saint yourself

Take a good look at him

166
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
If you're going to play the long lost Sun card better do it while we can change his will what are you giving me

167
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Agree for being an imposter

00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Excuse me if I don't take your word for it

173
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
For the record I think you're both full of it so this other guy who is he another student

00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,543
A bunch of you take turns reading books to shuvall the different boy every day of the week ain't that right

175
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,175
You've got that in common Kyle he's the Thursday boy

176
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,783
You're his real son

177
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
What's the point

178
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,415
I was passed along from foster home to foster home from most of my life

179
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,231
Usually sending me from bad to worse

180
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,095
But I finally ended up with a couple who loved me as though I were there very own

181
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
They're everything I ever could have wanted

182
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,775
But they're being so wonderful made me want to meet my biological father even more

183
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:36,127
I thought that if I could see what a sad little man he was with my own eyes

184
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,943
I could finally return my foster parents love

185
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
That's all

186
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
I was trying to do

187
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Hey look

188
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
Tell me something

189
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,791
Have you ever seen this Thursday boy that's one day of the week I always have off from work

190
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,143
But this one Thursday I wanted to grab something I'd forgotten

191
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,471
And he was there reading right tell me what he looked like

192
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Let me think

193
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,103
I want to say he had blonde hair and a very beautiful face

194
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Who is he

195
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,463
Someone in this University

196
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,023
Is pretending to be me

197
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
Carl are you listening to me this is important take this money

00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823

Name is hanske York isn't it who told you that old Mrs Bella from across the street

203
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
My dad's Rich isn't he she said he abandoned us how come you would do something like that

204
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
He didn't abandon us Carl

205
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
I'll just go where he is and you can find us there no you can't so when can I see him

206
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
Oh Carl when you're all grown up you can meet your father if you want

207
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
Hate him if he turns you away please bye

208
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:50,271
Because Mommy doesn't hate him even now

209
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:03,071
Keep this with you always it was a gift from your father on the day you were born

210
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
Carl I know who he is

211
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,079
Earth to Carl I know who the Thursday boy is

212
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,711
His name is Edmund foreign he's a philosophy major

213
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:26,111
I'm sure he's the guy we're looking for he reads books to shove all the Mansion every Thursday

214
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,743
Edmond Farrah get ready

215
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:38,143
You should be coming out of that lecture hall any second hey

216
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,239
Hey you wouldn't happen to know Edmund foreign would you

217
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Hey guys is Edmund here

218
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Who had been foreign

219
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663
I think he was a no-show today

220
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
There you go

221
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,903
Okay so he dodged the bullet today

222
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
But seriously

223
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,511
It's only a matter of time before we give that fraud what's coming to him

224
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,839
No imposter's going to cheat you out of shoe balls inheritance

225
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
It's not about the money

226
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:16,287
I couldn't care less if I see any part of his fortune no if they want to Rob

227
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
Duvet blind they can go right ahead

228
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Who cares

229
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Then why

230
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
Because

231
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
Because I can't stand the thought of this bastard far and pretending to be my mother's son there's no forgiving something like that

232
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,399
With the pedals of your silk flower swaying in the breeze The Cry of the Mockingbird rang through my heart

233
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
You haven't told me to stop reading yet

234
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:59,807
Why is that sir I berate you all the time why do you insist on

235
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Coming back

236
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,463
Here's the money that good that isn't why

237
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,863
With all due respect sir it's nothing like that

238
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,935
Is money the only incentive to do something in your world

239
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,519
In my world or any other

240
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
What are they like

241
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,127
Your parents

242
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,991
Actually I was raised by a series of foster families

243
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
Forgive me for praying

244
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,367
Would you meet your Rio parents if you could

245
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Well sir

246
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:46,399
Actually I'm yes this young man who reads to me just may be the one I've waited

247
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,495
It doesn't seem to be after my money

248
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Who is

249
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Never mind

250
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
I'm talking to myself

251
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,663
It's time we called it a day Norman

252
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
Oh one more thing regarding your Latin boy

253
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
It is much improved

254
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
Well thank you very much sir

255
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,103
Looks like Edmond Barnes playing hooky today too

256
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,455
Pictures laid up in bed with a bad cold or something like that

257
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,015
Tomorrow's Thursday he'll be there

258
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:40,415
He'll be at the mansion in so will I bust him as

259
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,719
Baker he is right in front of you right

260
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
That's awesome

261
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,863
Let's go get them already

262
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
I don't know sign of

263
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
It was supposed to be here an hour ago

264
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,335
If you were sick and stuck in bed at least then we would know where to find him

265
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Hey

266
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
I want to barge into his room and confront him there

267
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Hold on

268
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,527
Don't tell me you looked up Florence address

269
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
202

270
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,463
204 jackpot

271
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Here we go

272
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
It's been so Grim around here

273
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,383
The whole school's talking about what happened to Edmund foreign

274
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,551
The school paper actually printed a suicide note didn't they

275
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,879
I can no longer continue to deceive

276
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,952
So that's what it was about

277
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
I guess so

278
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:24,352
Spending all that time with you all to acting like his son maybe the guilt just blindsided

279
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,984
If you known he was going to grow a conscience he'd have been better off not trying in the first place

280
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,432
Yesterday must have been tough

281
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
Hey

282
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,480
Don't you know it

283
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,088
Since we're the ones who discovered the body the police held us for questioning all day

284
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,160
Well I didn't end up reading today after all

285
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,464
Mr shoevall is taking the news very hard

286
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
Hey I'm being rude

287
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,888
This is Carl he's the Friday reader a pleasure to meet you the same here

288
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
I'm call Norman from the economics Department I'm Johan Liebert I study in the School of Law

289
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,456
And you haven't touched a drink since is that correct

290
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,272
Absolutely not even a drop

291
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:20,672
Well that's very good but you have to continue to stay away from booze to give yourself the chance to start over there's

292
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:25,280
No way I'm going to drink as long as I report to you once a week I don't want to incur your Wrath

293
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:31,680
Hey I just the thought of it makes me afraid what are you talking about I always conduct myself in a very calm Prof

294
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,008
Professional manner I was kidding I don't have time to drink anyway

295
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,848
I got my first big case since becoming a private investigator

296
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,896
Well that's very good news

297
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Dr rifine

298
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
How would you judge this fellow

299
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
What do you mean

300
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,904
But using your knowledge of physiotomy I thought maybe you could tell me what kind of young man appears in this Photograph I

301
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
Practice physiotomy

302
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:58,304
Richard I'm afraid you're mistaking me for some kind of quack fortune teller a weirdo psychic

303
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
But you have a well acknowledged reputation

304
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,960
You're able to predict someone's behavioral traits from just a single glance right

305
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,568
That's the result of many years of accumulating information from observing patients

306
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:14,688
Then can you use all of those years of acquired wisdom to tell me if this guy looks like a con man

307
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Con man

308
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,552
That's not possible

309
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
A man with a face like his couldn't fool anyone

310
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
Even if you tried some kind of con he'd be easily found out

311
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
Ah

312
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,536
What are the odds that he commit suicide

313
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
Absolutely none at all

314
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,656
People with faces like his would never kill themselves

315
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,752
Well I must say doctor your observation seem to be pretty convincing

316
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
Then give me quite a lot to think about

317
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
And they're based on experience

318
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:47,456
So who hired you if you don't mind my asking Hans gay York shoe Von

319
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:54,112
You're working for shoebox I take it you know who he is am I right yes I'm quite familiar

320
00:23:54,368 --> 00:24:00,256
Here with him he's the wealthy vampire of Bavaria wow that immensely Rich gentleman is my client

321
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,072
The young man in the photograph is Edmund fahren

322
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:09,472
And in person at her who actually passed himself off as shoe volts son for a while you event

323
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:15,872
Actually gave himself away not really Mr Cheval bought every detail of his deception it

324
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
Isn't your typical run of the mill scam artist you know

325
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
I myself had a lot of trouble figuring out it was a complete fraud even though some pieces of the my

326
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:30,976
About I'm still remain how did foreign know so much about shoe volts missing son where do you get the information

327
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:36,096
Supplied it the only way is to go straight to the source and demand that foreign tell you

328
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,936
Yep normally I would but the boy committed suicide

329
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
They say

330
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:48,128
Come on now Martin think of it as a

331
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:54,528
Favor for an old friend at least let me take a look at the suicide note huh the handwriting's been analyzed

332
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,928
How to doubt the kid wrote it himself okay look you're an outsider now Richard I can't justify bending the rules

333
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,768
The two kids who found the body Carl Neumann and Loda Frank

334
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,352
Didn't they work at the same part time job as I've been Farin

335
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:13,216
They were just friends that's all well maybe they weren't such good friends

336
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
So how you doing anyway

337
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:21,408
Is it the same old grind yeah you know how it is we never have enough Personnel in fact I've had no time to

338
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:26,272
The rest since I took over your position so thanks a bunch Richard

339
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:31,392
Slowpoke Martin has become one of the big shots now you don't get to call me that anymore

340
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,816
When you have my boss anymore so I don't have to put up with your Wise Cracks oh come on Martin you just don't get it do you

341
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,376
You have no idea how much trouble you put us through

342
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,448
Believe me it was no picnic cleaning up your mess

343
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,896
Now if you'll excuse me I haven't got time to waste on simple suicides I'm a very busy investigator with

344
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,688
Important criminal cases

345
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,296
Yeah I want to check out the crime scene

346
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,112
I presume everything's been preserved right

347
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:06,976
I already gave the go ahead to have it cleared out since it's been determined that there was no crime

348
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,560
They'll be removing all of the deceased effects sometime today

349
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:16,960
Damn it when did Slowpoke Martin become so efficient

350
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:29,760
They're supposed to be arriving anytime now to take everything away don't worry I won't be more than a couple of

351
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,488
Most of hung is real from this pipe in the ceiling

352
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,888
It appears that he wrote a suicide note of this desk

353
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288
Here's a paper he was in the middle of writing the birth of tragedy process

354
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,688
Reality World Views on psychology far for the course for our philosoph

355
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:05,088
These must be the materials he was using for his paper

356
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:11,488
Caesar's gallic Wars now what was he doing with this book seems

357
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
Place Spanish or it could be Latin I can't read a word of it

358
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
This is the only passage underlined in the book

359
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,848
Up here it is room 204

360
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
YouTube

361
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
Better go down and get a bunch of boxes

362
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
Okay

363
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
Start with the books

364
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,040
It's going to take a while

365
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:39,392
Hey don't work too hard guys hey what should we do with this desk

366
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,208
Let's just leave it there all right

367
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Yeah

368
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,984
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your former neighbor

369
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,384
I have nothing more to say just leave me alone hold on I'm not with the local police I'm a private investigator I

370
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,784
Sure who you are Mister you're bothering me and I have a paper due tomorrow but I haven't been able to get it finished because of all the questioning and

371
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,600
Motion going on next door all right I'll be quick

372
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:15,232
Just one question then would you happen to know if these two were close friends of Edmund foreign

373
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:21,632
Couldn't say I'm too busy to hang out watching everybody around here but as far as I know that guy didn't seem to have

374
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:28,032
Any friends I ever saw really I've said enough go away hold on a second just one more little thing

375
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:34,432
Ah come on now what could you translate this passage for me the part that's underlined in red ink

376
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,064
This is just ridiculous it's going to be your fault if I flunked my class

377
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
Believe I'm doing this for you

378
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
And I appreciate it

379
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,512
It says I can no longer continue

380
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
To deceive

381
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:57,984
What was the last thing you said I don't know now if you don't mind I'm busy okay

382
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
So I can know

383
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,592
Longer continue to deceive

384
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
Where have I heard that before

385
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
You like coming here too

386
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,336
Hey

387
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:38,432
We met a few days ago Johan right why don't you come all the way up

388
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,016
You can get a much better view if you're standing up here at the very top

389
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
Right

390
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,048
Hey thanks for the hand

391
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,472
Oh man kind of scary up here huh

392
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,520
It's not scary at all

393
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,712
Johan come down from there

394
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
Come on stop it

395
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,576
I'm serious you're going to fall

396
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,928
Do you come up here a lot

397
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,976
Yeah

398
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,840
Around this time the lights start coming on and the neighborhood looks beautiful

399
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
Family members are returning home

400
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,264
And the delicious smells of dinner begin filling the air

401
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,848
It's something I've wanted for a long time

402
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,896
Really yeah

403
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,992
I guess because I never really had anything like that when I was growing up

404
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,064
So tell me what's your family like

405
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
Got it

406
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,976
Not something you want to talk about

407
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
Wish I could say the same

408
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,352
Being bounced from one foster home to another made it important

409
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,424
If you don't mind I'd like to hear your story

410
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,240
Tell me everything you remember

411
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,688
This is just sloppy police work

412
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:20,576
I can no longer continue to deceive and those words are supposed to be proof he was writing a suicide note

413
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,256
That wasn't a suicide note foreign was just working on translating a Latin phrase from this book

414
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,448
So anyway that's my story

415
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,288
I wish you weren't so depressing but it's all true

416
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,944
It's very strange but I feel like I can talk to you about almost anything in the world

417
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
Tell me one with thing

418
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
That rich father of yours

419
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,904
Are you talking about uvald

420
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:18,176
Those tears in your eyes are you crying for me

421
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
Listen

422
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,648
You got to do something Carl

423
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:33,536
I'm there every day tending to housekeeping chores and I see changes in him that really have me worried

424
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:38,144
Ever since Edmund committed suicide Mr shoebold hasn't been eating very much

425
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,520
If he continues to starve himself he's going to end up dying too

426
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,872
Carl why don't you try telling him that you're a real son

427
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,664
What have you got to lose

428
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,504
I want him to get to know me first and then maybe shoovald will grow to like me

429
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,112
If I tell him the truth now he won't believe it because he just doesn't trust me yet

430
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:04,768
He could completely reject me and think that the only reason I'm coming forward is because I'm after his money

431
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,328
Seems like money means everything to him

432
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
That's all he knows

433
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,192
So how can he understand how I feel

434
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,592
Well we can't just do nothing your father is in a deep depression and we have to come up with a way to get him

435
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,712
I see you're worried about him

436
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,528
But don't know what to do

437
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,856
I have an idea that I think might work

438
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,584
I can no longer continue to deceive

439
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,680
Edmund wrote these words but they weren't meant to be a suicide note

440
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,240
In his dorm room I found this Latin book

441
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,664
Caesar's gallic Wars and he was working on translating this underlined portion from it which means his death

442
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
Might not have been a suicide

443
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:00,832
I don't have conclusive proof it's just my gut feeling based on many years of police detective work

444
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
Have you been listening to a word I said

445
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Anything at all

446
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
No

447
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
Not really

448
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,032
It doesn't matter now

449
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,944
Don't say that it does matter you have to believe me if I'm right that Edmund didn't commit suicide

450
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,760
There's a possibility that your life's in danger

451
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
That dear lad

452
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:38,976
He was my son and I can't bring him back nothing matters

453
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:45,376
I've already told you the facts everything about him including his birth was completely unrelated to you he was

454
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
That was a fake a con

455
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:53,312
I'll Grant you he wasn't a very good con and apparently he didn't make it a habit of fool people but

456
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,640
It's precisely what he did to you Mr scheuval he just saved you

457
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:03,296
I must ask you to leave now Mr schewold is tired and needs to rest

458
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,648
I'm not going to let this investigation end yet

459
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:12,768
And my decision has nothing to do with this being my first high profile Pi job

460
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680
I can feel it there is a far greater evil lurking somewhere behind this case

461
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,008
Sometimes in life

462
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
Even if we want to

463
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:32,992
There are things we can't do over and we can't ever make right

464
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:39,392
They're gone can't you understand that

465
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
Yes I understand

466
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,464
Only too well

467
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,536
This isn't over yet

468
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
Good day to you sir

469
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,520
A children's rights treaty

470
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Yes

471
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,944
I guess you could think of it as an international rights agreement to secure and protect the civil liberties of children in countries

472
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
All around the world

473
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,552
That's what I'm currently working on in my Law class anyway

474
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:13,952
But my volunteer job with the orphanage is completely unrelated to that project I do this because I know I can help

475
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
A difference in their lives

476
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
Hey guys

477
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,584
Can we get back to what we were discussing earlier

478
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,912
You said you've all went bankrupt three times in the past

479
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Yes

480
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
After each one of them

481
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,032
He would just disappear

482
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,872
And when he'd reappear he'd start from scratch

483
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,920
And work to regain his fortune

484
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,832
Mr scheuval told me during one of our Friday reading sessions how this experience re-energized him

485
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
Gave him new strain

486
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,952
Well did you ask him where he went when he disappeared each time

487
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
Yes

488
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,304
I think I get it your plan is to take him there am I right

489
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,120
Everybody has a place to go where they can feel good

490
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:58,496
For you Carl it's the rooftop of the University building where you go to watch all the city lights

491
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Mr Coons

492
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,784
I think there's something wrong with the bathroom sink it could be clogged

493
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,576
Do you mind taking a look please

494
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,648
There might be water dripping out of those pipes

495
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,680
Lota there's nothing wrong with the sink it's working

496
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,336
Open up come on open this door now

497
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
Stop playing around child

498
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:56,352
Open up this door now where are you going with Mr schumold open

499
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,384
Hey guys that's that mission accomplished all right let's go aren't you going to tell me where we're going

500
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,504
It's a surprise

501
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,976
Look lady I'm well aware that you're not the real Margo Langer

502
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,328
I just want information on Edmond Florida the boy who died recently

503
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,632
He came to see you not long ago didn't he

504
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,448
Foreign remind me which one he was

505
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
Which one

506
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,032
Apparently I'm very popular

507
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,616
I had two pairs of visitors each said he was shoe volt kid

508
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,408
Was he the blonde one

509
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,712
Or was he the one with the black hair

510
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
The black hair

511
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:51,392
Yeah the black haired one came with a girl isn't that funny I still can't believe it actually show up with a girl

512
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,696
Well in a place like black hair you say

513
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
Did the girl have glasses

514
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,816
I got photographs of them somewhere at least two

515
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,912
Yeah that's who I saw

516
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,704
You're positive about this

517
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:11,872
He said that he was hansgalaxivald's son

518
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
Are you sure this is the right spot yeah I'm absolutely certain it should be right around here

519
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:24,672
Had to tell me the name of the surprise

520
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:31,072
We brought you out to visit Ellenburg Webster

521
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:37,472
We were hoping this place would cheer you up I'm sorry

522
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,288
Just let me out of the car

523
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,480
Can you see the lake from here

524
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,112
Leaves here always gets so beautiful in the fall

525
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,952
Yeah very much so

526
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:13,568
Wait something

527
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,200
Is missing what happened to the wrens why don't I hear the chirping of the Reds

528
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:27,392
Yeah I know I'm so sorry this place has changed

529
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:31,232
They've turned it into a construction site you can't hear them Carl

530
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,096
If you listen very carefully you can make them out

531
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,680
Little birds delightfully chirping in the trees

532
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:51,200
Minneapolis have ripened and fall into the ground

533
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:10,912
And when you turn in this direction

534
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,496
He will see a spectacular sight

535
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:20,896
Autumn Leaves a blazing color in the afternoon sun reflected on the

536
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:24,992
On the surface of the water like in a huge mirror

537
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
You must see it

538
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,600
Don't you sir

539
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:36,000
It's hard to believe such wonders exist

540
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,800
I see it I can see

541
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,583
Back up a second I just remembered something

542
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,519
You told me that you had two pairs of visitors and you mentioned that the black haired boy brought a girl with him

543
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,335
So then that means the blonde brought someone

544
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,687
Oh yeah that's right he did have somebody with him

545
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:34,367
That kid kept mumbling his words I could barely understand what he was talking about

546
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,767
The gorgeous boy you came along with him and ended up doing the talking he was the one giving me the lowdown and

547
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
Play truth be told

548
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:51,007
If it's good looking pal would have turned around and claimed he was shoe vald Sun I wouldn't have had any trouble believing him

549
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:57,407
Who's the other guy tell me

550
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
You're looking very well

551
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
Thanks

552
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
And how's your job

553
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
Everything going smoothly

554
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
I'm happy you're doing well

555
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Is Rosemary all right

556
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
How she adjusting

557
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,911
She's doing fine

558
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,471
She's made a lot of new friends

559
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,007
That's terrific

560
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
Sounds like she's fitting in

561
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
Yeah that's really good news

562
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:34,015
She's becoming used to her new school I'm sorry it's getting to be quite late

563
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,807
But right now before I forget

564
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,135
I brought you some pictures their new ones of Rosemary

565
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,743
I prefer to see her in person

566
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
How about 2 days from now

567
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
We can meet here again

568
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,823
Fact is I'm completely sober

569
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,383
My life's back to normal again well

570
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,479
Actually this may be the first time my life's been truly normal

571
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,575
It's finally clear to me how much I've screwed up

572
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,463
I'm going to let her decide whether she wants to see you or not

573
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
Yeah

574
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,791
I'm really hoping she will

575
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,351
Richard I have to go now or I'll be late

576
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
Yes sir

577
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
Just more coffee

578
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,831
Dr rifine

579
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,879
What's your impression of this man

580
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,671
Tell me something Richard

581
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,743
Precisely why do you think you're here

582
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Well

583
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,607
You're here for counseling I asked a questions remember

584
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:28,191
And as I've told you before I'm a doctor not a fortune teller

585
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:32,287
Right you're inside comes from your years of experience with patience

586
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,615
So who's the boy in the photo this time

587
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
A person of interest in my case

588
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:44,319
He made the initial discovery of Edmond Farms body at the alleged suicide scene supposedly he's a friend of the

589
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,903
Deceased that's all I know well here's what I know Richard yeah

590
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
You're a dedicated workaholic

591
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:54,559
But you've got to learn to take time for yourself to relax I'm beginning to do just that

592
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,607
Will wonders never cease

593
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,911
And doctor I have news

594
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
About what

595
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
Rosemary

596
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,567
I might be able to see her very soon

597
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,871
Well you must be looking forward to that

598
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,431
Yeah but just remember

599
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
If you do get to see her

600
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:17,855
You can't get back the time you've lost you need to be emotionally prepared for changes in her

601
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
No matter what

602
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:22,975
And listen you must not touch a drop of alcohol am I clear

603
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:28,095
Don't worry I won't I suppose you're off to work on your case again yep

604
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
Don't leave yet

605
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:36,031
I think it's time to talk about the event that God you kicked off the police force tell me Richard what do you remember from that day

606
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
Well

607
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
I remember all of it

608
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,639
He was 16 years old

609
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,199
And a suspected murderer

610
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,783
I've been drinking on the job when I spotted him

611
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
My shot I'm dead

612
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,623
He died because I was drunk

613
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,903
You faced up to it

614
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,975
But that doesn't erase it it will always be there

615
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,791
And nothing can remove that memory from your head

616
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,095
So do you know what's important now

617
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,655
Giving myself permission to move on

618
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,447
That's correct

619
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,495
You may step to the Head of the Class

620
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:13,151
Do I get an A+ Professor not so fast I don't give out perfect scores easily I demand results and

621
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:18,271
Besides I'm not all that crazy about perfect patience they're boring frankly

622
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,223
Carl neum

623
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:56,575
A business admin student in the economics department at Munich University

624
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:02,719
Apparently he told that prostitute posing as Margo Langer that he too is shoe Vault real son

625
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,303
At this point I don't know whether he was telling the truth or not

626
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
However

627
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,143
I need to investigate that possibility

628
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
Yes

629
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,823
Excuse me I finished all the cleaning so I'll be going now

630
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
Yeah

631
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,383
Thanks for all your hard work

632
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,431
Cleaning for you is never hard work

633
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:28,319
It's pretty rare for a man living by himself to be so neat it makes my job here extremely Pleasant

634
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:32,415
Well lately I've been trying to clean up my act on all fronts

635
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,719
I couldn't help but notice

636
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,023
You've got a new picture of your daughter

637
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
Yes

638
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,095
I may be able to see her soon

639
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:44,703
Really that's just wonderful your daughter will be so delighted

640
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:50,335
Do you really think so of course what young girl wouldn't be happy to see her father

641
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
Yeah

642
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
It was a tough one

643
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,879
So were you able to turn your paper in on time

644
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,951
Carl nor

645
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,255
I can't figure you out

646
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,351
If you know for sure then why haven't you told shuvall that you're his son

647
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,727
Are you just another con man or are you the real deal

648
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
If you're legit

649
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,799
What is stopping you

650
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:27,711
Don't you realize that any parent would be overjoyed just to see their own child

651
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
I'm so sorry

652
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,759
She said

653
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,295
She doesn't want to see you

654
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
That's fine

655
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:17,887
She's made up her mind I didn't want to force her it's her decision hey that's okay

656
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,423
Don't worry about it

657
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
It's fine

658
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
I've got to go

659
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Yeah

660
00:51:55,007 --> 00:52:01,151
Yes

661
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:07,551
What can I get for you sir whiskey will do

662
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:20,351
Here you go

663
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:12,831
Then I'll just go where he is and you can find us there no you can't oh Carl

664
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,391
When you're all grown up you can meet your father if you want

665
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,951
Don't hate him if he turns you away

666
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:24,607
Promise me that no matter what because Mommy doesn't hate him

667
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:31,007
Keep this with you always it was a gift from your father on the day you were born

668
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:43,551
With none to admire them

669
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,367
The daffodils of Loris proudly bloom

670
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,415
With none to mind them

671
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,719
The Trees of Peoria Russell

672
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,559
The bloody tracks of the nameless man

673
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,119
That was wonderful

674
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:03,775
I must say Norman you come a long way and become an excellent reader

675
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,079
Thanks very much sir

676
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:12,479
I'm impressed by how much your Latin has improved in the short time you've been reading for me to be perfectly honest

677
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,271
I'm being tutored by someone

678
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,599
Well he certainly is an excellent teacher

679
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,647
Would he be anybody I know

680
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,671
Johan

681
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,719
Johan Liebert is my tutor

682
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,351
A proficient young man

683
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
Yes

684
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,167
And not only in Latin

685
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:38,591
He has an extensive knowledge of Law and economics and amazing aptitude in fact for whatever

686
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
Studies

687
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:43,967
He's a boy who's beautifully gifted at everything he's True Perfection

688
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,855
Mr Shoe V

689
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,927
What would you think if a boy like him

690
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,767
What if Yohan Liebert was actually your real son

691
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,591
Then he smiled

692
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,919
It was the first time I'd ever seen him smile

693
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,991
He made it clear

694
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,783
That you're worthy enough

695
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,575
To be his son Johan

696
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,135
To be honest I was jealous

697
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,975
No matter which way I looked at it you came off better than me

698
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,303
I'm ashamed to admit it but I do envy you

699
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,863
Why don't you just tell him

700
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,311
Come on Carl what have you got to lose go ahead and tell you his real son will you stop it

701
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,639
How many times must I tell you I have no intention of doing that

702
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,479
What would be the point if I did he would never believe me

703
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,759
And worse than that

704
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:54,367
Then he'll think of me as just another greedy Predator only interested in getting hold of his fortune

705
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,903
He'll despise me forever

706
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,487
How my mother lived her life until her death

707
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,559
And with everything I've gone through up till now

708
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
He knows nothing about me

709
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:08,447
And I won't stand for him thinking I'm after his fortune when he doesn't know a thing

710
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,079
That's exactly why you should go talk to him

711
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,151
You have to gain his Trust

712
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,711
Make him understand the truth about his son

713
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,759
He'll never believe that I miss son

714
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:25,599
Well don't you have something from your past that would prove it to him

715
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:30,463
Anything he might recognize or remember

716
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,511
You know something you both could recall

717
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
No

718
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,583
There's nothing

719
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,863
Far as I know

720
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
Think back

721
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,935
There must be something

722
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:45,055
I'm drawing a big blank it doesn't matter I don't want to tell him okay

723
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:50,431
If that's the case can you explain why you spend all that time having me tutor you in Latin

724
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,271
Wasn't it because you wanted to please him

725
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,343
Because you wanted to make him proud of you

726
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,975
I'm thinking that maybe

727
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,047
I should quit my job being his reader

728
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:07,839
Yeah

729
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,375
It's for the best

730
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,751
Thanks for all your concern I appreciate it

731
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,799
But I guess I'm done

732
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
Johan w

733
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,247
I feel you're entitled to know

734
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
The truth

735
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,367
I do have something that can prove who I am

736
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,183
Well what is it

737
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:36,255
It's dumb I don't know why I'm still holding on to it

738
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,815
I'm not going to convince him and I don't need to

739
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,399
My foster parents are coming to visit me next week

740
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,471
I've been fooling myself

741
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
I'm not the son he'd want to have

742
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,567
So I see

743
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:55,967
When your mind's made up it's important not to waver so for the time being Carl I think it would be a good idea

744
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,551
Idea to let me keep an eye on your proof

745
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,647
We're so happy to hear your studies are going well

746
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,183
Isn't that right mother

747
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:11,583
But I've been worried about you Carl I want to make sure you're eating right I'm always eating out

748
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,143
What's so I know I have to be careful not to gain any weight

749
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:20,543
Better stay away from your mother's cooking too but it's so delicious

750
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,359
Are you making a lot of new friends here

751
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:27,455
I've got some people I hang out with and can talk to you about anything terrific

752
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:33,087
It's always good to have friends yes that's very true and it looks to us like you're doing quite well

753
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,415
I'm extremely grateful to both of you

754
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,951
That I can even be here

755
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,023
Whoa what's this all of a sudden there's no need for thanks

756
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:45,631
For years I was shuttled from one foster home to another where no one cared about me

757
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:51,007
But you two have treated me with such kindness that's because you're a wonderful young man we both think so

758
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,543
That's right girl

759
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:56,127
Thank you for everything you've given me Mr and Mrs Lindner

760
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,527
Isn't it about time you stop calling us Mr and Mrs

761
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,391
We came here hoping that you would finally accept our offer

762
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,695
We know this is been hard for you

763
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,743
But now

764
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:15,839
With college treating you so well mother and I were wondering if you'd made up your mind

765
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,655
Have you decided to become our adopted son Carl

766
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,007
We believe in you and we want you to succeed

767
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,287
We trust you

768
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:27,615
Trust us don't you oh absolutely

769
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,431
We understand why you might still be a little hesit

770
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,503
There's a chance your real parents are still alive

771
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,063
No matter how much effort we make

772
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:40,415
We can never be your birth parents but maybe there's no maybe about it

773
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,487
Because the both of you

774
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,559
Or is real to me as my birth parents could ever be

775
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,471
Oh my

776
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,079
Let's have a toast

777
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,407
Feel like some expensive champagne son yeah

778
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:06,015
Waiter bring us to Champagne list we're celebrating today's a special day

779
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,863
Hello

780
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
Carl speaking

781
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,935
Hello Carl it's me

782
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,983
Do you know who this is

783
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
Mr shoe

784
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,335
That's correct

785
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,639
Now watch this I hear about you

786
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,663
Quitting your

787
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,967
Right sir

788
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,015
That's very disappointing

789
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:41,087
I'm sorry for any inconvenience this might cause

790
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,159
I just hate to see you abandon your lat

791
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,207
You put so much hard

792
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,023
Thank you for your concern sir

793
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,327
It really is a

794
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,399
I'm going to miss you you know

795
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,727
As a favor to me

796
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,263
If you don't mind

797
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,799
Would you read to me

798
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,335
One last time

799
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
Sure

800
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
It'll be my pleasure

801
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,711
How about the third chapter of

802
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,759
From EOS to lemnos

803
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,087
A splendid choice

804
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,879
That mysterious

805
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:18,719
Beckons for the death of even the god Phoebus

806
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,279
What other pleasure could there be

807
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,071
Than to wish death

808
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,143
Upon the Sons and Daughters of Cerberus

809
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Now

810
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,239
Move forward softly whisper Zeus

811
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,031
Move forward move on

812
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:36,127
And dance in the temple that belongs to the dark gods

813
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,479
The gods of Juno who dwell in the sea

814
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,503
The Earth

815
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,039
And the heavens

816
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:50,463
From the summit of the Parthenon steal the forbidden apple of Campania

817
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:53,791
And bring forth the apple and everything

818
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,351
Everything to save my soul

819
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,655
Bring

820
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
Everything

821
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:37,311
Mr schufaul

822
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,871
But but your phone call

823
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:43,199
Magnificent

824
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:48,063
So heartfelt and meaningful the best I've heard in my whole life

825
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:53,183
Why did you keep this from me is

826
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,463
Is that mine

827
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,047
This rabbit's foot holds so many memories

828
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,631
I gave it to Margo a long time ago

829
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,167
A good luck

830
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,983
I wanted to pass that luck to you

831
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,543
This is yours Carl

832
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,591
My son

833
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:15,455
I've put you through so much

834
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:25,183
Oh Father I found

835
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:31,583
My son

836
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:37,983
This is all thanks to one person

837
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:44,383
He told me about everything his help was invaluable so from

838
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,479
Now on you'll be working for me as my secretary

839
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:55,135
He is a young man who can be trusted

840
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,743
That's good enough

841
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:03,839
When you say that just what exactly do you mean Mr shoevald

842
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:08,703
I've decided that I've learned enough I am calling off the investigation

843
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:15,359
But sir we had a breakthrough and I'm close to another I checked out Carl Norman and one thing certain that boys

844
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:21,759
Real son I'm quite grateful to you for all you've done now hold on there's still more to be done

845
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:28,159
You're still the Edmund foreign it should have figure out Edmund pretended to be your son but some evidence I am covered seems to indicate that

846
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:34,559
He didn't really commit suicide if that's really the case someone else is pulling the strings and may have killed foreign it

847
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:45,567
Father I made some tea would you care for some yes I would

848
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,663
Oh good afternoon Detective

849
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:56,831
Would you care to join us no thank you I'll be going

850
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:00,671
Once again good work just send me your bill

851
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:07,327
Good day it sure looks nice outside it does oh and Johan's

852
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,095
As well

853
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:12,191
What a surprise so Johan's decided to visit

854
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:21,663
Shoe volt it always been known as a distrustful man with a sour disposition who

855
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:25,503
Soul when he found his son

856
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:32,927
Well that smile of his who would have guessed that people still call him the vampire of Bavaria

857
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:38,303
What a surprise so your heart's decided to visit

858
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,383
How cute

859
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,967
So you're trying to track down this puppy huh

860
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,503
What a job

861
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:03,647
My client told me her ex-husband basically dognapped a little fella

862
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:07,487
I guess disputes over pets can be just as bad as one's over kids

863
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,023
You're right about that

864
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,607
I think I left some wine if that's quite all right with you

865
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,447
Are you go ahead I'll be sticking with a sparkling water

866
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:23,103
I'm glad to hear you say that I know it works scarce at the moment but it's a good choice on your part not to Cloud your life with

867
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,431
Alcohol and I'm doing okay at least I'm not account

868
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,967
What do you mean

869
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,295
Are you saying there's something else in your life that's bothering you

870
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:36,159
Well I find that with all the free time I have now I end up rehashing things a lot

871
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,183
Such as

872
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:43,583
I spend hours and hours pouring over this personal notebook I have of unsolved crimes cases I never saw this

873
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
Detective

874
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,887
How interesting

875
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,959
So tell me when you look at it how do you feel

876
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,751
I feel frustrated

877
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,079
There were so many murder cases I wasn't able to solve

878
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:58,687
It haunts me to think of those vicious Killers still out there walking around in our world

879
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,247
They're free because of my incompetence

880
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,807
Even now I can't seem to catch them

881
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,855
You're being too hard on yourself

882
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:12,511
You could have caught them you had the skills to solve those cases but yourself critical nature was impeding you Richard

883
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,863
You got frustrated that you couldn't read these murderer's minds and that caused you pain

884
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,911
So I turned to alcohol

885
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,727
Sure of course you did gentlemen

886
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,263
Dinner is served

887
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,311
Oh good it's time to eat

888
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:34,527
Actually I think it would be in your best interest for you to keep trying

889
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:38,623
I would encourage you to keep looking at your old police notebook

890
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,647
But why

891
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,439
I'll just become angry again

892
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,231
Stop thinking that way

893
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,559
You have to analyze what you did in the past in a new light

894
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,119
Your mind is clearer now that should help

895
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:53,983
Let's be frank with each other we both know that you shot a young serial killer when you were drunk

896
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:58,335
And I must say you are facing the reality of what happened that night admirably

897
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:01,663
But now Richard you face a far greater challenge

898
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:04,735
Facing your thoughts when you pull that trigger

899
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,111
You're still haunted by that boy

900
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,927
You see him in your mind everyday don't you

901
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,535
When you brought everything to light

902
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,607
All those things festering under the surface

903
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,679
That boys ghost will finally move on

904
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,167
I see when I've brought everything to light huh

905
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:00,287
The home of murder case is a good place to start

906
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:05,151
The victim you I came home or had a long and steady career as an accountant

907
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:10,783
It was never involved in anything shady and had no enemies and when he was murdered

908
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,831
There were no signs of a robbery

909
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:19,999
Then there were those two voice of God cases the victims were a former housekeeper and a chauffeur

910
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:25,119
What connected those two killings was that the words I have heard the voice of God were left

911
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,959
Scrolled on a wall at both crime scenes

912
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,543
The door knock company president case

913
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:38,943
Little girl cuz one of the wealthiest businessmen in Bavaria and his body was discovered in the heart told for

914
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,063
And then there's the spirit a couple case

915
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,671
Both were forcibly drowned at their bodies washed up along the Eastern river later on

916
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:55,071
This one's still being investigated is one of a string of murders involving middle-aged couples and material witness in

917
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,911
Case disappeared Japanese Doctor Who's still on the Run

918
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:05,311
Oh man and more unsolved

919
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,871
Places I had the more booze I drank

920
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:14,271
Then it felt good but it's different now this is tough it

921
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:19,647
I was just like the doctor said so I'm sober my mind is clear and I'm feeling calm

922
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,327
Hold on a second come on think

923
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,375
Playing card Richard

924
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:01,887
So

925
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,959
You tried doing it again and what was the result

926
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,775
I did I looked at all my notes

927
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,079
And I thought of something new but then I

928
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:14,943
You saw that boy's ghost again and once that happened you lost your train of thought right

929
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,527
There's no need to worry

930
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:22,623
When you have an important thought like that sooner or later it will come back to you

931
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,327
What was it that I realized

932
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:36,959
An idea flash through my mind it felt like it was a key to solving one of those cases

933
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
Just My Imagination

934
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:56,415
Who's there

935
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:02,815
Show Yourself whoever you are I'll catch you

936
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:09,215
This is like that time way back

937
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:15,615
I was running after that punk just like this I chased him down an alley

938
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:35,071
Sorry for coming here so late at night doc

939
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:40,959
Nonsense if you think you've figured things out and you're ready to share them go ahead then tell me everything

940
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:45,311
Back then I felt myself looking deep within that killer

941
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:49,407
That's when I knew it existed in this world

942
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:55,807
Later was true evil and once I saw it standing right there in front of me

943
01:12:56,063 --> 01:13:02,207
I shot and killed him that's good thank you for sharing Richard

944
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:08,607
By telling me this you're well in the road to recovery there's still more doctor it just came to me

945
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:15,007
That idea that it flashed through my mind before all those unsolved cases I

946
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,079
I've been working to solve separately I realized

947
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:23,199
They are actually one single case huh

948
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,063
Greetings my dear Dr Gillen

949
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:32,927
I'm writing to thank you for sending me a copy of your recently published book

950
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,231
Transcendental criminal psychology

951
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:41,631
I found your book informative and a very interesting read and it pleases me to see that a student of mine from Duss

952
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,911
Dolph University

953
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:47,007
Has now become a leading Authority in the field of criminal psychology

954
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,335
Now I have a question for you regarding another matter

955
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:56,735
You told me in a phone conversation that you conducted the lengthy interview with the serial murderer Peter Jurgens

956
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:03,135
After you spoke with him you told me that Jergens claim that a friend of is it encouraged him to murder the victims

957
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:07,487
Sadly my memory isn't what it used to be so could you please tell me again

958
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,839
What was the name of jurgen's friend who he said told him to kill

959
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:22,079
I'd appreciate that information as it may Aiden associate of mine

960
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,127
PS

961
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:30,783
As I mentioned earlier you were quite a student in college and excelled in my class and you had a fell

962
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,879
Colleague who was equally bright you often competed with him for the best marks

963
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:37,695
He graduated and became a neurosurgeon

964
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:42,303
At any rate it seems that he's become a suspect in a Multiple homicide case

965
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:46,911
With your expertise I'm hoping you could help me get a better picture of who he is

966
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,727
Please tell me everything you might know about him

967
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:56,383
What kind of person is he and where do you think he might be right now this Dr Tenma

968
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,223
I remember you you're a detective

969
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,271
It will I used to be

970
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,319
And now I'm a private investigator

971
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,903
I'm sorry to show up unannounced here at your door man

972
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,975
And I hate to bring up a subject I know must be painful

973
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
For you but

974
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,815
I'd appreciate it if I could ask you some questions again

975
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:21,215
Of course you can it's been 4 years since I last spoke to the police and it seems like they're done with their investigation

976
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
Mr

977
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,847
Yes I believe your mother was actually employed by

978
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,919
Wasn't she once the head housekeeper at his mansion

979
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:36,831
20 years ago

980
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,391
Well at that time she became very ill

981
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:43,743
And after her sickness she only worked close to home in the neighborhood

982
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:47,839
Was that it or could it be she had some problem with Mr Chev

983
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,887
No not at all

984
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:56,031
They were actually quite good friends she told me that she used to read poetry to Mr schewald when he was still able to see

985
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,591
My mother just loved reading poems to him

986
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,919
Come along

987
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,711
I want to show you something

988
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,343
Look how generous he was to her

989
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,671
I've kept all of them because they remind me of my dear Mother

990
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:19,839
Every one of those books are collections of poetry that were given to my mother as a thank you from Mr schupold

991
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:29,567
How are things change they had detective and the door knock company president cases now just a private

992
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:34,175
You worked as Mr gox Chief business liaison and personal secretary

993
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:37,247
I asked you once again did anyone hold a grudge against him

994
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,295
You mean did anyone hate him

995
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:43,391
Turned enough hours in the day to count all the people who despise him

996
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:50,047
In business Mr God was such a fierce adversary that he personally forced some of our competition to go bankrupt

997
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:54,655
But there was another powerful and well-known businessman in Bavaria wasn't there

998
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,215
How did Mr gauch feel about him

999
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,519
I take it you mean Mr Shoe volt

1000
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:05,407
Well they were lifelong rivals in business but of course you knew that right

1001
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,199
They knew each other very well

1002
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:12,575
When Mystic golf was still alive she was company went bankrupt two times

1003
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:18,719
That second bankruptcy happened when Mr gauch undercut two volts prices for the purpose of ruining him

1004
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:22,559
So what you're saying is the Mr gauch was consciously trying to crush him

1005
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:26,655
Mr schewald made certain we suffered serious losses too

1006
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,703
So then they both hated each other

1007
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
Of course

1008
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:35,103
A few times they happen to be at the same party and it looks could kill they both would have been dead

1009
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,431
Oh it was very tense they had explosive fights

1010
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,967
Like to Vipers

1011
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,527
But those snakes understood each other's every move

1012
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:47,135
Only those two tycoons could talk to each other on the same level

1013
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,439
I never felt like they were enemies

1014
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:53,023
This may sound weird but they were really more like friends

1015
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,903
Hey careful up there

1016
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:27,071
Oh yeah I knew Hans real well

1017
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:33,471
Poor Hans was one of those two people that ended up being victims in that awful voice of God murder case that Hans was

1018
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,263
A good guy he deserves better

1019
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:38,847
Just what is it that makes you say Hans was such a good guy

1020
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:42,175
He was nice always treated me to a drink or two

1021
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,247
Generous huh

1022
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,831
I heard that Hans used to work for Mr shoe ball as his driver

1023
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:54,463
He told me that but he worked at Shoe volts driver almost 30 years ago

1024
01:18:54,719 --> 01:19:00,863
Did Hans say why he stopped driving for Mr shoevald well that was around the time old company went bankrupt

1025
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:07,263
That's why he was fired huh so Hans never said that he and his boss didn't get along listen to me what I'm about to say

1026
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:13,663
Get along with anybody and everybody it was Hans he

1027
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:20,063
There's a prince even Rich bastards like that vampire of Bavaria shoe Vault he treated us

1028
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:26,463
Folks like kings and Hans always said he was the one who taught you about bird watching a time about bird

1029
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:32,607
He took him to the forest

1030
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,239
It's hard to believe that was 2 years ago

1031
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,055
But whenever I think of my dear husband

1032
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:46,687
I just can't understand why such a kind and wonderful man ended up being murdered

1033
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,223
It's unfair

1034
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,271
He died so horribly

1035
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,319
You have my sympathies

1036
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,599
Pardon my asking

1037
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,671
But I believe your husband grew up as an or

1038
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,303
Yes he lived in an orphanage till he was six then with different Foster families until he was 18

1039
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,607
After that he became an accountant

1040
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:10,239
Is it true Mr scheuvo the business tycoon asked your husband to be his corporate accountant

1041
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,287
He did many times

1042
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,336
But my husband always turned him down

1043
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:18,176
My husband was quite busy with work at the time but that wasn't why

1044
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:22,272
He said Mr scheuvald had a different set of financial principles

1045
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,344
When it came to money my husband was very honest

1046
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:29,184
Again thank you so much I appreciate the help

1047
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,720
My husband's killer

1048
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,000
Will he ever be caught

1049
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,792
I'll try my best

1050
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,072
If I can do it

1051
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,608
I swear I'll catch him

1052
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,632
Well then

1053
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,472
Yo one more thing

1054
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,240
Yes

1055
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:47,104
I forgot to ask you if you knew how your husband and Mr schuevault first met each other

1056
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,640
Oh that

1057
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,432
It seems they met in the forest

1058
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,712
The forest

1059
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:58,624
Yes they met in the forest back when Mr shoe ball could still see it was a total coincidence

1060
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,392
Place like that

1061
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:06,304
They were both their bird watching after they meant they went to the forest together all the time

1062
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,288
Bird watching

1063
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,592
More like a happy kid

1064
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:22,176
Red poetry to Mr shoe vald

1065
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,968
More like friends

1066
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:37,536
Hey buddy you okay yeah I'm fine thanks

1067
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,584
That guy was driving like an idiot

1068
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,400
From what I saw look more like he was trying to run you over

1069
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,080
Dr rakvine

1070
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:55,200
I've re-examined all the evidence and what I found out supports what I told you before

1071
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:58,528
Some of the key murder cases that I wasn't able to solve

1072
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:02,368
I'll point to one killer having just one motive

1073
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,976
There's the voice of God murder case

1074
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,792
And the door knock company president murder case

1075
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:12,096
The accountant murder case

1076
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,888
Look at the three of them

1077
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,680
They're all extremely different

1078
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:18,752
The methods in which they were committed for example

1079
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,312
And the victims were related to each other

1080
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,616
None of them even knew each other

1081
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,384
However

1082
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,712
I have discovered that all of them shared one common Bond

1083
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,552
There was a man who connected all the victims

1084
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,880
And because they knew him they were all murdered

1085
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:39,232
Every one of them was killed to further isolate Mr shoe

1086
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:48,192
There's also another Connection in these cases that's rather curious in the door knock company president case

1087
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:54,592
His secretary said there was a certain young man who was supposed to meet with Mr gauch right before he was murdered

1088
01:22:54,848 --> 01:23:00,992
And in the voice of God cases under I have heard the voice of God this name was scrawled there by the murderer

1089
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:07,648
And then there's the spirit a couple murder case since both of them drowned that case seem to be unrelated to the others

1090
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:14,304
But the name of the killer given by the Japanese Doctor Who was the only witness in that case was the same

1091
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,120
It was the same name in every case

1092
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,144
Yohan

1093
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:26,848
I've been in touch with the former student of mine who's now a renowned criminal psychologist he interviewed a murderer who claim

1094
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:33,248
And he committed his crimes on his friends orders in here he wrote that friend's name and the name that's in

1095
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:39,648
In this letter is Johan joh

1096
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:45,536
Is a common name but based on what you found it's also possible that all these cases could be related

1097
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:51,936
If by chance you're findings are true this Johan has been systematically murdering people for the past 4 years

1098
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:58,336
News I can't help but wonder why this man known as Johann is trying to force you've all into complete isolation

1099
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:04,736
Oddly enough Margo Langer the woman who bore you both suck conveniently died as well

1100
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:11,136
And there was that young student who was pretending to be shoe Ball's son he conveniently killed him

1101
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:17,536
Self as soon as he made his claim if Yohan really does exist I wonder where he is

1102
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:23,936
Right now perhaps he's close

1103
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:30,336
What a surprise so johans decided to visit

1104
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:36,736
Weather so beautiful

1105
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:43,136
Yes isn't it sir

1106
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,928
Right next to shoe volt

1107
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:05,408
Rainbow Ranger

1108
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:15,392
Hey that's not fair you're supposed to fall when I kick you

1109
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:21,792
My evil empire is going to take over the world you're puny little kick isn't enough to stop me

1110
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:28,192
The bad guys always losing the TV show don't you know anything hahaha well well how's

1111
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:34,592
How's the global domination coming along

1112
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:39,456
The big secret to breaking the rules is to make it look as though you're following them

1113
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:42,016
So what sort of plans do you have for the Earth

1114
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:48,416
Who knows why should I care I'm just going to destroy everything anyway

1115
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:54,816
A lot more fun than being a stupid hero yeah forget being a rainbow

1116
01:25:55,072 --> 01:26:01,216
Well guys shall we start making our way back

1117
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:07,616
Okay come on so did you have fun today

1118
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:14,016
Time to go home

1119
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:40,128
Finally starting to warm up a bit

1120
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
That's good

1121
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,176
I guess

1122
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:45,504
Has Rosemary you know

1123
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:51,136
Too busy romping around with her friends to get sick

1124
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:54,464
That's good she used to get those fevers like clockwork

1125
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:02,400
Hey remember that one time years ago rushing her to the doctor and the dead of night

1126
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:07,008
Household pictures you always keep them on you

1127
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:13,664
Of course I do I bet she's a lot bigger now they grow up so fast these photos of mine must be

1128
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,200
The ancient history

1129
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,224
But still

1130
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:22,624
No matter how grown up she gets I'll always know it's her the moment I'll rise mate She'll always be

1131
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:30,816
Oh almost forgot whenever she's ready please give Rosemary what's in the sandal up

1132
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:35,680
The newspaper clippings mostly and the official Internal Affairs report

1133
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:38,752
From when I shot that young man who killed all those people

1134
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:46,432
I'm not asking you to defend me

1135
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,712
You've done that enough

1136
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:51,040
I shouldn't have shot him and I'll be the first to say

1137
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,952
I just want our daughter to know to know the truth about her old man even if it's terrible

1138
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:05,888
I understand

1139
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:13,312
She said either way I'll ask her again if she

1140
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:19,712
To see you if she's okay with it then so am I really oh thank you

1141
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:26,112
Just give me a call at the latest time usually home by 9:00

1142
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:32,512
The old you again like that when you first made detect

1143
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:38,912
Remember that fire you had in your belly when you and I first met

1144
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:43,776
We both had it

1145
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:51,712
So what do you think if you enrolled today we can get you in at a lower premium the thing of it is we already

1146
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
Already have insurance

1147
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:57,600
We don't really need another policy let me just show you our rates Mr Liebert that's all I ask

1148
01:28:57,856 --> 01:29:00,416
The coverage we have right now is more than enough

1149
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:03,744
I couldn't afford a whole new policy at the moment anyway

1150
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:08,096
We've had our current one for 4 years ever since we moved into this neighborhood

1151
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,912
4 years huh where were you living before

1152
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,472
Well over near Manheim in Boone town

1153
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,776
Bruton how about that

1154
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:19,360
It's a nice area so are you folks from their originally

1155
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:22,432
Yeah we are and the nice is an understatement

1156
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:25,760
So do you folks have any kids

1157
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,808
He's attending the University of Munich

1158
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:34,208
Now that's what I like to hear as it turns out we're offering a new plan that's perfect for young adults hear me

1159
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,232
This won't take a minute

1160
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,840
Oh your son I presume

1161
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:43,168
Well he sure was a handsome baby what's his name

1162
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,984
His name is Johan would you like some tea

1163
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,288
Yeah don't go to any trouble on my account

1164
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,848
They must keep him pretty busy at school

1165
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,712
Seems like he hasn't called us in a long time boys get like that when they leave the nest

1166
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:58,784
Sounds like you speak from experience

1167
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,352
Hello Dr rifine

1168
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
I'm back

1169
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:16,960
Yeah I went to Johan's folks house

1170
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,240
That's the thing

1171
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,288
They were normal as could be

1172
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,824
Totally average

1173
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,872
So what do you make

1174
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,640
Richard

1175
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:30,272
Hello back in my detective days I probably would have said there's nothing fishier than normalcy

1176
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,808
Or something to that effect

1177
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,344
Now I just don't know

1178
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,368
Hard to tell

1179
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:37,952
At any rain I'm going to keep checking out the people around you hun

1180
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,048
Where's the flaw

1181
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,584
Nobody's that perfect

1182
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:52,800
You want to enjoyed a great reputation during his prep school days is grades were top-notch and is evaluations painting

1183
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:53,824
Is a model student

1184
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:36,064
The baby's face in the photo

1185
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:40,160
There's no way he grew up to look like you're on

1186
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:44,768
Here you go sir the birth certificate you asked about

1187
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
Thank you

1188
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:52,960
Johann Wilhelm Liebert date of birth

1189
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,288
9th of February 1976

1190
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:00,896
So it was definitely born in this town

1191
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:04,736
Everything here reads pretty legit

1192
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,904
Mr Hertz how many times do I have to tell you you cannot

1193
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:16,768
Not light up in here just give me an ashtray I promise I'll smoke it real quick no way

1194
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:21,888
And risk another fire like 4 years ago I am not replacing all those damn files again mister

1195
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:25,472
You had to recreate your files from scratch

1196
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:31,872
Well yeah we did have to ask people to resubmit their information it took a while but we're a small

1197
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:38,272
Town so we got all our ducks in a row again eventually

1198
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,696
Hey thank you so much for coming Dr Gillen

1199
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,232
Good to see you again

1200
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,536
It's been too long Dr reichvine

1201
01:32:55,936 --> 01:33:02,080
So I'm to understand that when Dr tenmark came to see you he was looking for a young man he called Johan

1202
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:05,664
That's right but there was no evidence with which to corroborate his story

1203
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:10,784
However if the young man in this photo is the friend who manipulated my current research subject

1204
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,624
When Peter Jurgens a serial killer into committing another murder

1205
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:18,464
Then Clues must exist that tie these three events together

1206
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,792
I'm counting on you Dr Gillen right

1207
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:24,864
I'll get clearance to interview Jurgens as soon as possible

1208
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:28,960
I'll let him see this Photograph and monitor any reactions

1209
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:32,032
If it might help prove 10 minutes innocence it's worth a try

1210
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:22,976
So he's dead

1211
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,256
That's right

1212
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:28,864
The real Johan Liebert who was born in Boone Town died when he was 2 years old

1213
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,144
Hold on

1214
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:36,800
You're saying the liebert's replaced their dead sun with someone else and after that fire destroyed the original records They

1215
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:39,872
Who's that chance to plug the other boy into that identity

1216
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:41,920
I'm afraid so if they did

1217
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:46,272
Then who's this young man masquerading is Johan Liebert alive and well

1218
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,064
Beneath the lies

1219
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,344
Who the hell is

1220
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,648
At any

1221
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:56,512
I did pass along Johan's photograph to Dr Gillen when he stopped in to see me

1222
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,608
Hopefully he'll get to interview that killer of his again sometime soon

1223
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:01,888
Now then

1224
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:04,960
How about dinner sorry but it's getting late

1225
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:10,592
Another time what's this you run around all day and now you're working through the night as well hard

1226
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,896
I'm expecting a very important phone call

1227
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,944
Cross your fingers

1228
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,248
There's a chance I may get to see Rosemary

1229
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,528
Really

1230
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,576
Don't worry I'm okay

1231
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:24,160
You're always telling me to focus on the road ahead aren't you

1232
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,720
Of course

1233
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,024
This is an important step in your recovery

1234
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:40,032
Yes hello

1235
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,408
Hi Daddy

1236
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,432
It's

1237
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,576
Hi Rosemary

1238
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:56,928
Daddy's fine

1239
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,488
Of course

1240
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,024
I'd love to see you

1241
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,328
You say when

1242
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,376
And I'll be there

1243
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,728
Mr Brown

1244
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,264
It's Johan

1245
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,384
Tell me you're against this young man

1246
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:18,432
Do you recognize him

1247
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:22,272
Maybe you've met him somewhere before

1248
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:26,880
I don't know him

1249
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,256
Best friend of yours Johan right

1250
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:36,352
You only know him through his letters you've never actually met him isn't that correct

1251
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,472
But Johan certainly seem to know a lot about you

1252
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,848
Could I borrow your pen for a moment

1253
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:47,872
What's

1254
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:53,504
I'm sorry you know the rules here prohibit me from giving you anything

1255
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,424
The park

1256
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,008
That's where I was

1257
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,312
Killed someone the day before

1258
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,896
I remember thinking I'm going to stop killing people

1259
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,944
I've had enough of office

1260
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,992
That's what I told myself

1261
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,040
He was there

1262
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:29,088
With a bunch of kids

1263
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:35,744
Wait hold on a second I should be recording this just start over again please

1264
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,144
Come with us come with us

1265
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:48,544
Come with us come with us comma

1266
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,904
What are you doing here

1267
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,208
We met at Mr schewald's estate

1268
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
Remember

1269
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,536
Johan Liebert sir

1270
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,888
I've been trying to get in touch with you but to no avail so

1271
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,680
I figured I'd drop by

1272
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:23,616
Yes

1273
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,432
Oh Dr Gillen it's you good

1274
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:30,784
So did anything interesting happen when you showed Jurgens that photograph of Johan

1275
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,648
Wait he's

1276
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,672
Correct

1277
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,464
I'm at the hospital right now

1278
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:41,024
The police still aren't done questioning me

1279
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,048
So I'm stuck here

1280
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,936
Listen we lost a vital witness tonight because I was careless and handed a psychopath of ballpoint pen

1281
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,496
But I do know one thing for sure

1282
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,288
Jergens committed suicide

1283
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,848
Because he saw that photograph of Johan

1284
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,432
I'll be over there as soon as I finished up with

1285
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,712
The police all right

1286
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,736
All right

1287
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:03,040
I'll give Richard a call and let him know

1288
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,184
He'd better be home

1289
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,168
The report for class huh

1290
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,448
That's right

1291
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,776
On the recent un convention on the rights of the child

1292
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:27,104
And if the treatment of juvenile offenders holds up

1293
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:31,712
Well how rude of me care for something to drink no thanks I'm fine

1294
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:35,040
That's right you do abstain from alcohol

1295
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,576
Yeah

1296
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:38,112
Probably for the best

1297
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,672
You did have quite a drinking problem

1298
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:44,512
I mean you were drunk when you shot that boy isn't that right

1299
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:46,304
Or so I've heard

1300
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,608
Yes I was

1301
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,144
Not that it matters

1302
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:56,032
What I did is unforgivable drunk or not I have a few questions about what happened if you don't mind

1303
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,848
Tell me about the victim

1304
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:01,152
Stefan Yos age 17

1305
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,480
Of what crimes did the child been accused

1306
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,528
Don't be so naive son

1307
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,320
Yours was a monster

1308
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:13,184
He was old enough to rape and murder nine women and almost killed two more

1309
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:18,048
So you executed him no I didn't pardon me

1310
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,328
Speaking of

1311
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,632
Article 40 of the UN convention

1312
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:26,240
States every child is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty according to the law

1313
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,544
Were you familiar with that

1314
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:33,664
Yes of course I was I used to work in juvenile detention

1315
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,200
And article 37

1316
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:41,600
The one that goes you cannot impose capital punishment or life imprisonment without possibility of release on any person

1317
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,904
Symbol of the age of 18 you know that one

1318
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:49,280
The convention Agreements are considered basic human rights for adults and children Al

1319
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:55,680
What kind of a fool do you take me for you really think I planned it all out in advance my shooting him was a drunken mistake

1320
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:59,008
Look I know that what I have done can never be undone all right

1321
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:03,360
And I accept the consequences of my actions

1322
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:08,224
I'm not trying to antagonize you I just want to cover my topic from every angle

1323
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:12,320
I'm very sorry sir I really should have used more tact

1324
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
Shall we walk

1325
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:15,392
The night am I doing some good

1326
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,000
I'd like to purchase the bottle please

1327
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,816
Just something to take the edge off of the night air

1328
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,632
Oh Dr Gillen

1329
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:27,936
I keep calling him but there's no answer

1330
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:35,360
You know Richard did say he might be getting to see Rosemary soon but this hardly seems the hour for a father-daughter reunion

1331
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:40,224
Well when you finally do get a hold of him let him know how dangerous that young man can be

1332
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:44,320
And tell him that I'm in route to his apartment

1333
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:48,160
Did you ever look into Stephanie's background

1334
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:54,560
Of course he grew up in an East German orphanage or something like that there's more to it than

1335
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:58,400
His crimes were to be expected

1336
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,936
If you knew his past

1337
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,496
To a child like Stephen

1338
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,800
That orphanage was hell on Earth

1339
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,360
He was a good boy

1340
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:11,968
But that didn't save him from the horror that might have even made it worse

1341
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:14,272
That orphanage devoured his mind

1342
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:16,576
And then picked its teeth with his soul

1343
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:22,464
The convention on the rights of children article 6 the right to life survival and development

1344
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:28,864
Article 8 preservation of identity Article 19 protection from abuse to Stefan these were

1345
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:35,264
So many fairy tales Eva there's no more fitting word for a place like that I can barely speak its name

1346
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,872
Allowed 511 kinderheim still sends a chill down my spine

1347
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,712
When will you be seeing your daughter

1348
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:46,272
What did you say

1349
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,064
How do you know about her

1350
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,136
Before you answer the door you were on the phone with her

1351
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,928
Isn't that so

1352
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,720
When do you see her

1353
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:56,000
Tomorrow maybe

1354
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,168
Enough talk

1355
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,704
What are you up to

1356
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:07,264
I'm just doing research for my report

1357
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:13,920
That's all no damn it I'm on to you kid you're going to tell me what you've got planned for shoe Vogue

1358
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,248
So who are you

1359
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:19,296
Who are you

1360
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:25,952
Tell me

1361
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:32,352
You got drunk and shot that boy to death that's what

1362
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:41,056
Plenty of people did see you drinking in a bar that day but that was after you'd already killed

1363
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,664
It's kind of odd Mr Brown

1364
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:52,320
I've researched this case exhaustively and try as I might I can't find a single person who saw you drinking before

1365
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:58,720
You murdered that young man not a one Mr Brown this charade has gone on long enough

1366
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:01,536
Will you really drunk when you pulled the trigger

1367
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,608
You are quite sober

1368
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:11,008
And you are calm you executed Stephen Yos and you knew exact

1369
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:17,408
Did I get it right

1370
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:23,808
I'll wake the mind when it wants to forget maybe you didn't forget

1371
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:30,208
Maybe you're lying is it a lie you tell everyone around you or perhaps a lie you tell yourself

1372
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:36,608
Were you absolutely certain he committed those crimes certain enough to put him down like a

1373
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:43,008
Dog you are guilty of murder do you think your lies can free you

1374
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:49,408
That

1375
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:55,808
Blood is on your hands how are you going to look Rosemary in the eye tomorrow isn't her daddy

1376
01:44:56,064 --> 01:45:02,208
