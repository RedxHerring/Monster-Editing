1
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
Outstanding yes his skills are truly unmatched the aneurysm was in such a delicate

2
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
Location

3
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,056
Yet he clipped it off so effortless

4
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824
ENT

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,896
Another perfect operation by the Peerless doctor

6
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,248
I was finally able to observe the genius surgeon at work for myself

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
No I couldn't have done it without your help

8
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
Thank you all very much

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
It's not midday already

10
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,768
Well you know that surgery did go on for almost six straight hours

11
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,584
We don't have any more patience today

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
You should go rest

13
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,864
Mommy where's Daddy what happened to Daddy

14
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Wake up sleepy head

15
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
It's time to wake up after 10 minutes

16
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
Looks like rolls have been rever

17
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,088
It should be a princess like me who's awoken with a gentle kiss

18
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,536
Well I guess you did forget about our date didn't you cancel

19
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,120
I didn't forget

20
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,448
Appeared before the Press yesterday along with his family

21
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
Appeared to be in fine spirits

22
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
The family will remain in dusseldor

23
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
For an unknown period of time

24
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,272
Before moving to a home provided by local government authorities

25
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
We'll be following this story

26
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
With great

27
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
Feel like I'm still so exhausted

28
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,536
Hey wake up look at the TV

29
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,352
But seems to be recovering well after undergoing surgery

30
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
Is holding a press conference now

31
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
We take you there live

32
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,384
Mr rosenbach's diagnosis showed a ruptured aneurysm in his cranial artery

33
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
The operation went smoothly

34
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
Including the successful clipping

35
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,040
Of the patient's cerebral hemorrhage

36
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,512
Yes well we will certainly do whatever is necessary for him to be able to sing again

37
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
Isn't that wonderful Kenzo

38
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
It wasn't even about me

39
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,736
It was all about your father

40
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:10,368
But it's only because you did such a wonderful job last night working as part of Father's team

41
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,928
I'm sure he appreciates all your hard work

42
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,512
Since you're the one responsible for raising the hospital's reputation

43
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,071
No I'm the one who should be grateful

44
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,935
I mean after all it is thanks to your father that I'm actually able to work here in Germany

45
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
Hang in there Kenzo

46
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
It won't be long before father becomes chairman of the board

47
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,711
Soon after that you'll become chief of surgery

48
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
And then Chief director

49
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,855
Which means I'll be the director's wife

50
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,695
You better make me happy Kenzo cuz hardship doesn't suit me

51
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
You still want to go out on that

52
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
I said we just

53
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
Blood pressure 128 over 64

54
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Spatula

55
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
I will now scrape the pyramus

56
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,183
As usual you did a magnificent job

57
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
Thank you very much

58
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,071
But it seems to me that your talents extend beyond the or

59
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
Well you're the head of neurosurgery it's such a young age

60
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,007
You've become the Golden Boy for both the director and the chief of surgery

61
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,359
And on top of that you've even captured the heart of the director's daughter

62
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,943
What exactly are you trying to say doctor sorry

63
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,087
I'm not suggesting you've done anything wrong here after all hospitals are ruled by politics

64
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,159
If he is using you then it must mean that you are gifted

65
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,743
When you do become successful don't forget about Good Old Becker

66
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,047
I'll buy you a drink next time

67
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
May I

68
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
Help you

69
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
Are you Dr Tim

70
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
I am

71
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
Give me back my husband

72
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
Me back my husband tell me just tell me what can you operate on

73
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,799
Who are you my husband was dying and he was brought to this emergency room first

74
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,639
He came in long before that stupid opera singer was here

75
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039
But you made him wait to be operated on everyone says you're supposed to be the best surgeon

76
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
This entire Hospital

77
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,839
I remember now yes sir you shouldn't be here right now

78
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
Doctor get over to or one immediately these are the directors orders doctor so please hurry

79
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
Why if you had operated on him he would have survive

80
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
Bring him back to me bring him back

81
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,879
And then my friend and I started fighting over that dress

82
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
It was the only one they had in that size can you believe that

83
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,279
But don't worry about it of course it was mine in the end

84
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Hey are you listening

85
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Is there something wrong

86
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
You seem distracted

87
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
I checked the records

88
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,127
And the surgeon who operated on the Turkish man was Dr Becker

89
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
Why are you still talking about that

90
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,271
If you look back over the charts they clearly show what happened

91
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
Becker took too long to treat that man I don't know but I think if I had performed the surgery on him I might have been able to

92
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Save his life

93
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,303
Do we have to talk about this at dinner

94
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,911
I was just following orders from the director when I performed surgery on that opera singer

95
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
I'm not responsible

96
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
Well am I

97
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
Well of course not

98
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
After all people's lives aren't created equal

99
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,583
Is that the house

100
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Yes

101
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
One of the neighbors called in

102
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
How many shots were fire

103
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Five or six sir

104
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
Who lives in this house

105
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Well it seems

106
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,967
It seems to be the residents of the Levert family who recently fled here from East Germany

107
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
This is going to turn into a big mess

108
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
One

109
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,991
Someone's there

110
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
There appears to be

111
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Survivor a girl

112
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,679
A man and a woman are dead a boy is in critical condition I repeat

113
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:49,567
One boy is in critical condition

114
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,647
A bullet to the head is that boy the only patient

115
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:10,047
Yes his parents were DOA it seems to have been a robbery all right then

116
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:16,447
I'm about 5 minutes out I should be there shortly

117
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847
Oh Father

118
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
Evening Dr heinemann

119
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,527
I'm terribly sorry for keeping your precious daughter out so late what are you talking about Tenma

120
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,343
It's all right Ava is your fiance isn't she

121
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,927
Now what are we all doing standing here come in have some tea

122
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,839
So tell me something have you notified your parents in Japan about your wedding date yet

123
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Yes sir

124
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,775
But my father runs a small Hospital back home so I'm not sure if he'll be able to take the time and come all the way out here to

125
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:58,175
Germany well wouldn't it be a good opportunity for him to take some time off and enjoy a Leisure trip overseas

126
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,991
They should come we're taking care of the expenses anyway

127
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
Thank you very much sir

128
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,367
I'm completely indebted to you for everything you've done for me

129
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,023
Did I ever tell you that when you first arrived here in Germany I thought you were a high school student

130
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,119
And now you're the best young doctor at Eisler Memorial Hospital

131
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
By the way Kenzo

132
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,311
I want to talk to you about your current research on cerebral vascular spasms and subarachnoid hemorrhages

133
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,407
Oh good I've been creating a model of a subarachnoid hemorrhage in a dog

134
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,223
I'm sorry but I'm going to have to cancel the project

135
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,855
I have been asked to speak at the next European medical convention

136
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,183
And of course that means preparing a sharp presentation

137
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,255
That's why I want to have you compile my manuscript

138
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
Sorry my research is very close to being completed I'm almost finished by the way Eva did I tell you what happened earlier

139
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,007
Later today

140
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,847
The suspicious group of civilians forced their way into the hospital

141
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,687
They were protesting the operation We performed on the opera singer

142
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:08,063
They claimed we pushed back the case of a Turkish man who'd arrived at the ER first

143
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
They got the whole thing wrong

144
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
That's not how it happened that Turkish man was operated on first there was not a thing wrong with our Pro

145
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Right Tim

146
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Yes

147
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,799
Apparently they think we're some kind of Charity or something

148
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,663
Our priority is to progress as medical Scholars before we save lives

149
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
Don't you agree

150
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,367
In any case I do want you to work on my manuscript

151
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,207
I have great expectations of you Doctor Tenma

152
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
I appreciate that sir

153
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
Where's the patient they just brought him in

154
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,655
How's he holding up

155
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
Blood pressure 72 over 50 his pulse is at 1:37 the bullet entered through his forehead

156
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,383
We need x-rays immediately yes doctor

157
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Who's this

158
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
She's the twin sister of the little boy we just brought in

159
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
Any injuries no

160
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,791
But she seems to have sustained a serious psychological shock

161
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,215
Yes what is it

162
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,175
Dr Ten

163
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,271
The boys x-rays in CT scans are ready

164
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,343
I understand I'll be there shortly

165
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,207
It entered the front of the head and stopped deep in the center of the brain

166
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
Yes

167
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
This one is definitely going to be difficult

168
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,143
The bullet is touching the left side of the middle cerebral artery

169
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Here

170
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Will you look at that

171
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
Dr Tema is absolutely right

172
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
This one won't be easy

173
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:42,431
If you jostle the bullet even the slightest bit then they artery could rupture and cause a massive hemor

174
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
Hey so I'm late talk to Becker you're supposed to be on dut

175
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
I don't understand how you could be so late

176
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,047
Will do a full frontal craniotomy and remove the bone fragments and contaminated brain matter

177
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,607
Then we'll remove the bullet very carefully

178
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,167
And lastly repair the arterial wall

179
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,567
But with a little hard work and some luck I'm certain that we can pull it off

180
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
Blood pressure 120 over

181
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
Pulse 92

182
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
He's looking good

183
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
The anesthesia is taking effect

184
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,767
Oh there you are doctor yes

185
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
You shouldn't be here

186
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,631
You're needed in operating room 1 immediately

187
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,751
It's critically urgent mayor rudiger has suffered a cerebral blood clot

188
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,919
He's being transported here by helicopter they're scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes then

189
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,039
I think the best thing is to contact Dr Boyer there's a chance his carotid artery is blocked

190
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,855
If that's the case we want you to operate on him

191
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,231
But sir I can't do that I was just about to begin surgery on that young boy

192
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
It's an order from the director

193
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
Hello this is Tim

194
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Hello tema

195
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
Take care of the mayor will you

196
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,663
I've contacted Dr Eisen and Dr Boyer

197
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
It'll be good to have that extra support

198
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
In case you

199
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,343
But Dr heinemann I was about to start another operation right now

200
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,647
Just let Dr Becker take over that

201
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:35,327
With all due respect sir the patient I'm about to operate on has a bullet up against his left middle cerebral

202
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,143
Ordering it could turn into a very complex surgery

203
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
But I am confident I can save him director

204
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
So I'm going to let Dr boy or take care of

205
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:52,223
I'm expecting you to do everything in your power to save the mayor

206
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
You need to understand something very important in the next review of medical facilities the mayor has promised our

207
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,207
Spittle a very generous increase in funds

208
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,767
We can't have him die just yet

209
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Do you understand

210
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,863
I'm expecting you will do this

211
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
I'm counting on you Doctor Tenma

212
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Yes sir

213
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:22,175
The mayor has just arrived on the heliport doctor

214
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,247
After the CT scans are done do the angiogram

215
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,391
We need to confirm where the arteries blocked

216
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,511
About time to get ready Dr timma

217
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
Yeah we're all counting on those brilliant skills of yours

218
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,007
Is something the matter doctor Tenma

219
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
I have

220
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,735
I have a surgery to perform in the other room

221
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:04,415
Hey where are you going Dr Tema but this is an order from the director

222
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,815
Mayor is having a CT scan done on him now doctors please report to the reading room on my way

223
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
Hang in there kid I'll save you no matter what

224
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
Blood pressure 120 over 80

225
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Pulse 92

226
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
I will begin extracting the bull

227
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
Bullet is extracted

228
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
Removal process is completed

229
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
It's a little early to be relieved

230
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,943
We must still reinforce the walls of the damaged blood vessels

231
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Right

232
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
80 Proline

233
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:53,215
His current blood pressure is 128 over 72 and his pulse is 88

234
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,543
It looks like he's still under the effects of the anesthesia

235
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,551
Live on kid

236
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,623
Survive and have a good life

237
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:17,279
Oh Dr Boyer how did everything go it looks

238
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,839
Looks like the procedure went smoothly on your side

239
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
Yes the surgery went well at least

240
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,215
The mayor wasn't so lucky

241
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,567
Really is that so

242
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,895
That's very unfortunate news

243
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,711
You act as though his dying has nothing to do with you

244
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,807
The truth is doctor that you're the one who abandoned our team

245
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
Just before surgery too

246
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:48,511
But wait that child was brought in before what does it matter is

247
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:54,911
Selfishly left us a man short we had to scramble to cover for you at the last minute and somebody died and then wait a minute just

248
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:01,311
Who sent the teamwork after 10 Mi you are aware that I followed the director's

249
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
And I clearly instructed you to perform that surgery on the mayor did I not however you chose to IGN

250
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
You decided to act on your own I've already given my

251
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Report to the director

252
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
You deeply regrets this incident

253
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,448
This will greatly affect our Hospital's reputation

254
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:33,312
You have only yourself to blame

255
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,944
So wait please wait

256
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
Doctor Tenma things are looking very good at the moment the boys blood pressure is 114 over

257
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
82 pulse 84 overall sir the boys vitals are very stable

258
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Well that's good to hear I just want to say Sir the operation was amazing

259
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,688
After collapsing on a holiday retreat

260
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
As soon as his sudden death was made public

261
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Life of the May

262
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,192
They are Road Acres cause of death was a cerebral infarction

263
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,520
Caused by severe infractions of the inner carotid artery

264
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:42,176
We certainly did everything we could for him but the condition caused intense swelling of the brain and it resulted in the

265
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Mayor's untimely death

266
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
A city official explained

267
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,904
I've got to get some sleep

268
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
Which took place late last night

269
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
Terrorist act against the

270
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
Who had recently fled here from the East

271
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
A full investigation is currently underway

272
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,296
The boy has not yet regained consciousness

273
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
And is still in critical condition

274
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
Now the weather

275
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
The whole country

276
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,024
It's a shame I wonder what it'll end up happening to the boy

277
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
On the way I'm just like him now

278
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,056
Mrs Reinhardt and ICU is complaining that she's having a hard time sleeping that said do you think we

279
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
We can give her something to help her sleep

280
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Doctor Tenma

281
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Are you listening to me

282
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:56,672
Oh I'm sorry yes in that case give a one house in tablet please that should help her get some sleep

283
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,328
What is with him today he's been spacing out all day

284
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,656
Hey

285
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,008
Dr Becker it's you Alex like you're going through a bit of a tough time there

286
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,080
Come on fish up have you heard anything from the director yet

287
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
I did try to warn you didn't I

288
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,016
I told you the hospital is ruled by politics

289
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:28,160
I knew what I was talking about and if you played your cards right I'm sure your future would have been smooth sailing

290
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:35,584
Oh well I guess what this means is you and I are on the same boat now my young friend

291
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,448
Come on 10 man don't be so depressed

292
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,520
I know you'll get a chance to redeem yourself sooner or later

293
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,640
What do you say we go get some drinks that'll put a smile on your face

294
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,272
Hold on a second nurse excuse me

295
00:24:54,528 --> 00:25:00,672
I still need to get a statement from the girl would I be able to go in and question her now

296
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
Time

297
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:05,280
That girl has disappeared from her room what did you say

298
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,680
Seems like she's always slipping out of her room and wandering all over the hospital

299
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:41,632
And so the reason that Eisler Memorial

300
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:46,752
Royal Hospital has proven to be the nation's leading medical facility is first and foremost

301
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:53,152
Because we're blessed to have excellent Personnel such as yourself and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank

302
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:59,552
Every single one of you for that unfortunately as you

303
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,624
Oh no just yesterday the mayor passed away in our Hospital

304
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,464
Of course as always we did our utmost to save his life

305
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,304
And because of that this Hospital's reputation remains intact

306
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,472
And I appreciation let's have a round of applause for Dr Boyer and Dr Isen who strive to the very end to

307
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
Try and save the mayor's life

308
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
I looked over your thesis young man you did an excellent job please keep up the

309
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,328
Good work all right

310
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,984
Excuse me

311
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,616
Oh yeah I'm so sorry I apologize for what happened sir

312
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,480
Now now don't worry my boy what's done is done

313
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
Director

314
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,344
You did what you thought was best you followed your heart

315
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,136
Why don't we just leave it at that

316
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,696
Thank you sir

317
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:15,072
Ladies and gentlemen may I have your attention please now a word from the head of neurosurgery

318
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:21,216
Please excuse me it looks like I'm being called up there no you're not Timba

319
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,896
Allow me to introduce the newly appointed Dr Boyer please make your way to the microph

320
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:35,296
Come on but so what does this mean if you wish to remain at this

321
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:41,696
Hospital you may do so but you'd better give up any dreams of furthering your status it's not possible for irrespons

322
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
Possible people such as yourself

323
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:51,168
I recognize your skill as a surgeon but that is it and you can forget about presenting any research papers at future

324
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Conferences

325
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:58,336
But sir please listen to me you decide to transfer to another hospital I have no intention of recommending

326
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,504
In other words it's useless for you to Harbor any Ambitions you have successfully tied The Noose around your own

327
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,424
Successful surgery requires teamwork it's only with everyone's help and cooperation that

328
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:43,648
Ava please you have to talk to your father for me

329
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:53,632
Spare me Kenzo You're such

330
00:28:53,888 --> 00:29:00,032
Fool

331
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
Dr Norton you're looking very handsome this evening thank you you're looking especially beautiful tonight

332
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,832
Yourself Ava

333
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
It's quite ironic really

334
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,272
I came to Germany after I discovered one of director heineman's papers

335
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,344
And as soon as I get here it takes me under his wing

336
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,952
So now it all makes sense that paper I was so impressed with

337
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:56,096
It was probably written by someone else someone he was grooming just like he'd been doing with me this whole time

338
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,448
I knew that he was really just using me

339
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,824
But I was hoping that when I'd reached a certain status I'd be able to make my own choices

340
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
With what I wanted to work on

341
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,760
Our priority is to progress as medical Scholars before we save lives don't you agree

342
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:20,160
That's not true her doctor's priority is disabled every can after all people's lives

343
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:32,960
He tells me there's a flaw in my character what about him he says he's a doctor but he's just a greedy Bast

344
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,288
Bastard

345
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,384
He'd be better off dead

346
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
I have to thank you

347
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,184
I have to thank you because you helped me open up my eyes as a doctor

348
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,072
So survive and live a good life after all I did throw away everything in order to save you

349
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:05,728
That's how far I went to give you your life back and I would do it again

350
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,504
You know your name don't you

351
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,552
Your name is Anna Liebert

352
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Isn't that right

353
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,840
I did try to warn you that all this was a bit too soon for her Detective

354
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,912
Isn't there anything we can do doctor

355
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,728
She saw her parents get shot to

356
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:44,384
She's fine physically and I think her trauma induced Amnesia is natural given the circumstances

357
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:48,992
Is there any chance you might be able to wait to get a statement from her after she gets better

358
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:54,624
Not really this is a very difficult case one of the victims was a former East German diplomat

359
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:59,232
If we're not able to solve this quickly the bka will be all over our back

360
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:03,584
Those guys always come here after the fact and try and steal the show from us

361
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
I haven't got time to take things easy

362
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
What if we do this yeah

363
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,824
We let her see her brother and then she'll probably be so relieved to see him that it might help her regain her memory

364
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:20,480
I cannot possibly agree to such a risky proposition that's completely out of the question besides I'm sure doctor Tenma would

365
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Never permit such a thing

366
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,832
He's in charge of Johann her twin brother

367
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
Sure feels like I'm getting a run around

368
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:40,960
Hey Dr Tenma you seem a little bit out of it you all right I mean you are looking awfully tired this morning

369
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,032
I've been so busy with emergency surgeries

370
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,592
Wow it seems like they've been working you to the Bone

371
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,896
Well ever since you were demoted from Chief

372
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,248
Well I don't mind really it actually makes me feel better

373
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
How are you really doing doctor

374
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,184
I'm sorry I've just been paged I need to go

375
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,536
Are you so sure it's a good idea to keep on going like this

376
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,096
Hard work won't get you anywhere

377
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
Look at this doctor Heineman

378
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,752
Look at all the gifts and letters of encouragement

379
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,336
Yes there are mountains of them in his sister's room as well

380
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:24,736
The media keeps reporting on the twins heartbreaking soda after losing their parents and how they're now on

381
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
Grown and this is what we get

382
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:33,440
As far as this hospital is concerned with no one alive to pay their medical expenses and nothing but an inconvenient

383
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,768
Now so their story is a pitiful one that works for us

384
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:43,168
It only means this hospital is garnering attention think about it a moment doctor these kids

385
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,984
Very valuable to us am I right or aren't I

386
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:52,896
Yes sir why don't we do this we'll give the media a photo of the siblings together

387
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:59,296
They'll probably be thrilled to have something like that yes that's something the media has been requesting for some time now

388
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:05,696
But the thing is just do it don't be naive it'll be a picture of the orphan sibling struggling bravely

389
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:12,096
Survive under the warm hearted care of our Hospital staff however the boys attending physician says

390
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,192
It is still too early to allow them to see each other who's on this case

391
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,776
It's Dr Tenma not anymore

392
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
What's that

393
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:25,920
There's no need to leave him in a position that's getting so much attention

394
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,248
Just take doctor 10 Mile off the case

395
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
Yes sir

396
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:40,256
This is a heartfelt gift from the citizens yeah why don't you have one thank you

397
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,984
You're looking well Mrs Hank

398
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,056
How do you feel I'm feeling quite well doctor

399
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:59,456
And I owe it all to you thanks will be removing your stitches very soon so it won't be long until you

400
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,272
You mean I'll be able to go home soon

401
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:08,160
That's right just make sure you follow my instructions all you have to do is rest

402
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:15,328
You still need regular doses of anti-convulsants and anti-hypertensives okay

403
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:21,728
Anna wake up

404
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:28,128
What happened to her we brought her in to see her brother and

405
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,528
She just she just started screaming and why did you do that

406
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:47,328
Dr timma take her back to a room doctor Boyer

407
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:53,728
Telling me what this is about and why the camera we wanted to commemorate the emotional meeting of the

408
00:35:53,984 --> 00:36:00,128
Twins and then release a picture to the media will allowed you to do such a thing I should have been consulted I'm the boys

409
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:06,528
You've been dismissed as the boys attending physician as of today he's

410
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:12,928
So I made my own judgment that it would be fine for the twins to see each other

411
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:20,096
Children were just following the

412
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:26,496
Disorders and I think it would be best for you not to fight him I seen this boy's life it's my duty to protect him until

413
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:30,848
Fully recovers well in that case just take a look

414
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:37,248
As soon as he saw his sister he reached

415
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,392
Down to her and began to cry you see he's regained Consciousness and is reacting normally to stimuli

416
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,208
Which means the surgery was a great success

417
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,048
So good job your work is done here

418
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,144
I'll get back to your post that's in order

419
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:10,528
So it was

420
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:16,928
Directors orders ha don't make me laugh we'll give us a damn about what the chief says bunch of

421
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:23,328
They're less for power and money screw them

422
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:36,128
I'm not wrong no matter what those bastards think of me

423
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Hello

424
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
Father I'm home

Are you in your room

427
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
Excuse me Dr Boyer are you still in a meeting at this time of night

428
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,584
Hello father are you sleeping already

429
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,168
I'm coming in

430
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,808
That bastard

431
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,624
Have a bastard be better off today

432
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,736
Hello sorry to bother you at this hour We're Here on Official Police business

433
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:20,064
Would you happen to be Dr tema

434
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,416
Can I help you pardon my asking

435
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
But were you home all last night

436
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
What

437
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,560
No I was out drinking until dawn

438
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,888
Why do you ask well sir Eisler Memorial Hospital

439
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:38,752
Battles director heinemann chief of surgery doctor oppenheim and Dr Boyer

440
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
They're All Dead

441
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,712
No one except the police are allowed to enter the scene of the crime

442
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:54,112
But you're interfering with the operation of this Hospital press is not allowed inside that patience in this kind of Chaos

443
00:39:54,368 --> 00:40:00,512
Can you tell us please was it an accident or was it murder three people died at the same time of course it was murder

444
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,912
Are you part of the hospital staff tell us would you happen to know anything about this internet out of my way let me through

445
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:13,312
Hey no one's allowed in I work here I'm Dr Kenzo Tenma come on step back

446
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,456
I'm sorry sir but I don't think this is the time to be

447
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,184
Calm down everyone is the emergency room running smoothly well actually we're swapped with the emergency cases right

448
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
No doctor

449
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:36,352
Two patients are waiting to be operated on all right then I'll see what I can do can you take care of the car accident victim with the

450
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:42,752
First I'll go look over the X-rays how about the other case the patient collapsed with a stroke

451
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
Doctor

452
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions

453
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,176
I don't have time for this I understand but this initial investigation is vital

454
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,528
Do you know of anyone who could have possibly held a grudge against the director and the others

455
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,088
A grudge doctor

456
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,392
Did someone come to mind no

457
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Sorry

458
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,744
We have a problem

459
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Those kids

460
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
The twins the boy and the girl

461
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,888
They're gone sir we can't find them anywhere

462
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:18,336
And is the little girl's bed empty is well nurse

463
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,736
What's going on what the hell is going on

464
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:36,256
In his Mercy he lent a hand to many who were ill and suffering we will

465
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:42,656
Always remember his Great accomplishments farewell Dr Heideman may you

466
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:49,056
Amen

467
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,455
Ava

468
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:01,855
I know it's difficult but please try to hold yourself

469
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,679
This whole funeral business is just too sad Dr timma

470
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
Yeah

471
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:23,359
Up until now she was fed with a silver spoon as the director's daughter but now suddenly she's just another ordinary person

472
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:28,991
That's got to be quite a big shock how can you say that right now sorry about that

473
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
Dr Tenma

474
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,159
I am inspector Vise Bob the nordheim westfallen police department

475
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
Thank you for your efforts this was such a tragedy

476
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
Yes let me introduce you

477
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,327
Dr tanma

478
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,911
I am inspector Lungi I'm here from the bka

479
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,983
I've heard about your amazing abilities

480
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
No

481
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,823
I still have a long ways to go

482
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,831
Do you have any leads at all to the children's whereabouts no but we have determined the cause of death for the

483
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,879
The director and the other two doctors

484
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,975
We have discovered traces of nitrate inside all three of their bodies

485
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,535
Please that's a muscle relaxant exactly

486
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,839
I see you're not a doctor for nothing

487
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,911
How could something like that end up and was candy

488
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
Candy

489
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:25,055
It turns out the same candy wrapper was found beside each of the bodies

490
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,383
The same substance was also found in each of their stomachs

491
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Tell me

492
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:35,807
Would you have any idea where they might have gotten this candy or something else of that sort

493
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,367
I wouldn't know where they got it from

494
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,439
If you don't mind me asking how was the search for the twins going

495
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:47,839
The bka is taking over jurisdiction on this particular case from the local authorities please don't worry

496
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:54,239
As it stands after investigating certain events we believe all this could be tied back to the moment the twins parents

497
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Was shot to death

498
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,615
First their parents defect from East Germany and are murdered soon after that

499
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:06,015
Then staff from the hospital where the children were treated are also murdered political terrorism may be a possib

500
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:12,415
Those children might hold a major key to this whole mystery they need protection please do

501
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,487
Your best to find them inspector we certainly will

502
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,815
Excuse us

503
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:26,239
Interesting a Japanese doctor demoted by the director

504
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:30,591
And then his engagement at the director's daughter broken right before the incident

505
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:35,455
But the man was in the bar drinking at the time the crime was committed it checks out

506
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
No

507
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,039
I still have a long ways to go

508
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:45,439
Dr Timo was actually quite modest about it when I commented on his well-recognized talents earlier

509
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,791
The police huh

510
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
What are they think in your suspect

511
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,399
There's enough evidence to implicate me

512
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,935
Nothing I can do about it

513
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
I don't worry about it

514
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,287
They were persistent when they questioned me too

515
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,127
God I'm so exhausted

516
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Once this whole thing gets settled

517
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,991
I think I'm going to go back to

518
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
And

519
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
I came to Germany to do research but

520
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,391
With everything that's happened I see again

521
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,743
Most important thing for a doctor is to save lives

522
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:26,143
Come on don't get all depressed on me now just tired

523
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:31,519
So so tired

524
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,799
Mr Buckner

525
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,591
You're making great progress

526
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,943
Thank you so very much Dr Tim I'm glad to hear it

527
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,503
Do you think I'll be able to work like I used to

528
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
Yes of course

529
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:47,903
Good because if I'm not there I'll have no choice but to close shop however

530
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,255
You mustn't overdo it and I'll stop by your restaurant for a drink after you released

531
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,815
Now that's just to make sure that you're not over working

532
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,887
See Dr Tim yes

533
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,447
I heard that you were leaving this Hospital

534
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
Is it true doctor

535
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
Don't quit

536
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,335
Please don't quit

537
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,407
Good doctors like you are so hard to find

538
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,223
Please stay please don't say you're quitting

539
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
Please

540
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,647
Mr

541
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,279
Doctor Tenma the chairman is asking for you

542
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:30,399
Right now he's in a meeting with the board discussing how to fill the open positions

543
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,239
Until now most of these posts were held by Dr heinemann's followers

544
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:40,639
Seems like they're going to be major changes for example the rumor is Dr eckner is being transferred to a small

545
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
I see

546
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,991
Chapter 10 now hold on

547
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:50,879
No matter what the chairman says please don't give up I want you to know we're all behind you

548
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,695
So please don't leave the hospital

549
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,143
Let me say this again

550
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
I'm performing so

551
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
And that's the reason

552
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,055
I'm making you chief of surgery

553
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:30,815
Oh God real life this is

554
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:43,615
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue but I'd heard you'd been appointed chief of surgery

555
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,663
I'm truly happy for you

556
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
Thank you Eva

557
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
Kenzo

558
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,807
That day at my father's funeral

559
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,879
I remember you were trying to comfort me weren't you

560
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,231
It made me happy

561
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,839
A lot of things happened between us but I'd like to start over

562
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
Cancel

563
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:20,479
Listen please forgive me I was wrong let's start over

564
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:37,631
Patient is hospitalized for a spinal cord tumor

565
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:44,031
His paralysis has accelerated I understand I'll do the operation myself excellent

566
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:49,407
Doctor I'm glad to hear that make the arrangements for the procedure right

567
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,807
I've had it with this damn flood

568
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,647
I thought the world would change when the Berlin Wall came down 6 years ago

569
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,927
And it did

570
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
The worst

571
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
It's true

572
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:08,351
They talk about a unified Europe but we just keep getting dumped with the bad

573
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,703
The rate of unsolved crimes is definitely on the rise

574
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,311
Inspector we have arrived sir

575
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,407
Both victims had their throat slit

576
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,943
It isn't pretty

577
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
Their identities

578
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,783
Mr and Mrs reichmann from Stitch Drive

579
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,575
They were murdered in their home

580
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,391
We believe they were hidden away in a closet

581
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,975
But we're washed out into the open because of the rising flood waters

582
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,047
Another middle-aged couple murdered for greed

583
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,399
In the past two years there have been four other similar cases across the country

584
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,447
All murder the same way

585
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,239
Probably the same Thief

586
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
No

587
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,335
It's too premature to call these simple robberies

588
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
Judging from the data

589
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,455
For some reason none of these couples seem to have had any children

590
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,271
Well this couple didn't seem to have any children either

591
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:01,343
Don't you think there are too many factors in common here

592
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,927
To make the Assumption this is just a simple robbery well sir

593
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:11,071
I'm just going by the fact that money and goods were taken from all the victims homes it was all of it totally a small amount

594
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,911
Although this would make sense if it were the work of a single perpetrator

595
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:21,311
Hold on you're suggesting there's more than one two of the homes in question had extremely strong locks and sophisticated

596
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Alarm systems

597
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:26,687
But the perpetrator bypass them and was able to enter without any trouble

598
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Also

599
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,783
None of the couple showed any signs of struggle before they were killed

600
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,087
And the neighbors did not hear a single sound

601
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,879
The time the incident took place

602
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:38,719
Don't you think these were orchestrated all too well for just one suspect

603
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,511
Yeah maybe

604
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
Do you know this man

605
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
No

606
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,887
Adolf Yonkers 32 years old

607
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,447
He's been arrested twice for larceny

608
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,775
In a robbery he's the one who Gets You Through the front door

609
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,567
In other words a lock pick

610
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
It turns out

611
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:59,199
He was spotted near the area and three of those four double murder cases

612
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,247
Then he's got to be the man right

613
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
Or not

614
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,063
It's too early

615
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
Well

616
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,415
In any case detective your job here is done

617
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,975
The bka will take it from here

618
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Sure

619
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
Oh well

620
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:25,567
It didn't fly after all sorry about that I've never flown a kite before in my life it was good you almost did it

621
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,383
Well doctor do tell how was your date last night

622
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:33,247
Oh well she seemed like a nice girl

623
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,831
She's the daughter of a director don't tell me you just had dinner and saw her home

624
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:42,975
Well actually there was an emergency call during dinner so I had to come back to the hospital hold on you did what

625
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:49,375
You'd better rethink that all work or no play doctrine you're going to lose a great catch and regret it

626
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,215
Do you hear me hey are you listening to a word I'm saying

627
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,799
Oh okay good morning doctor how are you

628
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,591
Is this yours Carl

629
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,383
My Grandpa gave it to me

630
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,199
But it won't fly I think it's broken

631
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,247
Maybe the alignment needs to be adjusted

632
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:11,135
Well doctor do you know how to fly a kite when I was a kid back in Japan I used to do this a lot

633
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,743
Hold it up in the air now all right you ready

634
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,815
How like this had a boy

635
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,863
Now here we

636
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,551
It's flying

637
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
All right

638
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,391
Oh man

639
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,439
If I were as smooth as that

640
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,767
I have at least five lovers hell maybe even 10

641
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,535
Seriously

642
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,095
That's so awesome Dr Tenma

643
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,399
Get better soon Carl

644
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,239
So that next time you can fly it yourself okay

645
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,759
Today's surgery is a paracellular meningioma extra patient

646
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,855
We'll proceed with a right tyrional approach yes

647
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,647
Everyone watch closely

648
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,463
The chief of surgery himself is heading up this one

649
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
Brilliant operation

650
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Just look at

651
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,351
That is hardly retracted the brain at all

652
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,423
He is truly a surgical genius

653
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,263
New residents should learn to treat the brain with such care

654
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:03,775
This is terrible and ambulance

655
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:08,127
I didn't do it this wasn't my fault

656
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:11,199
This guy ran into the street all of a sudden out of nowhere

657
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,015
Is this the patient

658
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,807
Yes

659
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:16,831
How is

660
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
Well

661
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
We tried

662
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,183
But there isn't much we can do

663
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,999
This man is material witness in a case

664
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:29,119
It's important that we get his testimony since it may help us solve a string of Serial murders doctor

665
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,679
We can't have him die on us

666
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,007
But inspector this patient isn't very critical condition

667
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,823
Really there's nothing else we can do for him here

668
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:42,431
However there's a top-notch neurosurgeon at Eisler Memorial Hospital

669
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,455
If he comes here

670
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,735
He might be able to do

671
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
Neuros

672
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,599
That would be Dr tinma

673
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:56,511
Thanks for coming all the way out here Dr Tim

674
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:00,607
What's his condition right now he is conscious but a bit delirious

675
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,655
Also one of his pupils is Dil

676
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,471
It's been a while hasn't it Dr Tenma

677
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,871
Sorry but do I know you from somewhere sir it was 9 years ago

678
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,175
The director's funeral remember

679
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:17,759
Oh yes you were from the bka inspector lunge

680
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:23,135
Please do be sure to perform a successful operation for the sake of the bka

681
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,439
The thing is Doctor

682
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:31,839
This patient has to survive he holds the key to solving a very important case

683
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,911
The sake of the police I do it for the sake of the patient

684
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:39,519
Fair enough doctor now if you'll excuse me I have an operation

685
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,127
I hear you've become the chief of surgery

686
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,663
Well no doctor

687
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,735
You certainly become very successful

688
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,271
Yes and what about it

689
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
Nothing

690
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:55,903
That's your age it's quite an accomplishment aren't you next in line to become the

691
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,719
I still have a long way to go

692
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:05,119
Those murders years ago at Eisler Memorial Hospital due to a lack of evidence that investigation has seen

693
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,655
Very little progress

694
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,727
The only clue we found was the poison candy

695
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,823
This suggests it was a calculated act on the part of the Killer

696
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,871
In that kind of crime

697
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,431
The killer always has something to gain

698
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,967
From the victim's death

699
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,015
What are you getting at inspector

700
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,807
Nothing forgive me

701
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,343
In my line of work

702
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,671
The mind doesn't stop I'm always thinking like this

703
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,463
In any case rest assured

704
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:35,071
Of all the cases I've ever handled throughout my career not one is gone unsolved

705
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,607
Not a single one

706
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:41,471
Well I'm glad to hear it

707
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,455
Will perform a craniotomy to remove the hematoma

708
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,783
If we don't hurry the brain hernia will worsen

709
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:01,439
After the Eisler Memorial Hospital murders

710
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,231
No matter which way I looked at it

711
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,559
One person had everything to gain from the incident

712
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,143
And that is you

713
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,679
Doctor Tenma

714
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,407
Thank you again for going to all this trouble driving all this way

715
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:27,807
No don't worry how is the patient responding well he is still conscious but is right people does remain Dil

716
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,367
He's also got Paralysis on the left side

717
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,927
But he has already started rehab hasn't he

718
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,975
The paralysis should go away

719
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:41,375
He's on the right track listen I think the police want to interrogate him as soon as possible but that's out of the question

720
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,703
But doctor that detective Loom gay is a very persistent man

721
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:48,031
Right now the patients recovery is all I'm worrying about

722
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,271
How are you feeling Mr Yonkers everything okay

723
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,087
So

724
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:04,415
Tell me Mr Yonkers are you able to recognize me

725
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,975
Do you see this finger I'm holding up

726
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,303
How about it

727
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,839
Can you talk to me today

728
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
What's that

729
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,335
I'm sorry

730
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,359
What did you say

731
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,503
Coming

732
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:33,087
Mr Yonkers what's coming

733
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,623
Coming

734
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:44,607
Monsters coming the monster

735
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,775
Yonkers

736
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,335
I know you're able to speak

737
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:59,455
You have been identified at the scene of the crime of four murderers

738
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,527
Involving middle-aged couples in the past two years

739
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,319
There's no point denying

740
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
What do you say

741
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:17,119
All right okay I guess we had better tell you that we already know that you are just a lock pick

742
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:23,775
You couldn't have possibly slit their throats in one single slash with such cold blooded Grace Yonkers no

743
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
That wasn't your work

744
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:29,151
Now that means there had to be other accomplices involved

745
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:34,015
And I'm thinking there would have had to have been at least three of you in order to do both

746
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,807
Open a strong lock

747
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,367
And murder a middle-aged couple

748
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,903
Without resistance

749
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,695
That sound about right

750
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:48,095
We're almost through compiling a list of suspects who we already know our skillful with knives it's only a matter of time

751
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,911
And before we're able to narrow it down to one name

752
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,239
Whether you decide to cooperate with us or not

753
00:59:56,031 --> 01:00:01,151
However I must confess that's not really what I wanted to ask you about

754
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:08,319
What I would really like to know Mr yunkers is why four couples from across Germany and every one of the couples

755
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
Middle-aged and without children money and items were stolen but we know the amounts were too small to just

756
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,279
Define murdering for a mere third of it

757
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,631
All right

758
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:28,031
So tell me are you up for some negotiation if you confess now we'll dismiss all charges against you

759
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:34,431
So tell me who is the person who hired you to do this

760
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:47,231
Mr Young Chris it's all right it's all right

761
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:53,631
I don't think so we're almost there get out of

762
01:00:53,887 --> 01:01:00,031
That's a doctor I'm ordering you

763
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:06,431
Very well but I'll be coming back at a later time and just to make sure he isn't poisoned or that he doesn't

764
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:12,831
Pier I will assign a guard to watch him closely that shouldn't strike you

765
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:19,231
They're always seems to be so much trouble happening all around you Dr Tenma

766
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:25,631
We'll keep in touch

767
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,455
Hey hold on where are you going

768
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,807
Just going out for a walk it's not supposed to leave the room without permission

769
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,623
Patients need to get fresh air every so often

770
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,671
We're just going out into the garden

771
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,975
You're welcome to come with us if you like officer

772
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,031
Very

773
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,079
It's nice and warm out here today

774
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,431
You are able to talk aren't you

775
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:16,319
It's afternoons like this one that make you happy to be alive you know

776
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:20,415
If it weren't for times like today I don't think I'd be able to go on

777
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:24,767
Especially when you're here constantly seeing people having to fight for their lives

778
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:30,911
That's why it's easier for some doctors to think about their money their research or getting promoted

779
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,983
I used to be one of those guys myself

780
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,079
I wanted to get promoted and do my own research

781
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:42,687
I was positive that being successful in surgery was the way to the top

782
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:48,575
But have to performing a surgery on a certain little boy and everything changed for me

783
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,647
He was the older of twin siblings

784
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,695
Been shot in the head

785
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,815
Saving his life reminded me why I had become a doctor in the first place

786
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,679
It reminded me that all human lives should be regarded as equal

787
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:07,007
And that a doctor's job is to save those lives

788
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,871
Thank you

789
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,039
People start over all the time

790
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,343
It's never too late believe me

791
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
You know something

792
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,167
You and I are very close in age

793
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
But you're almost like a father to me

794
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,567
Well it looks like I landed myself one big kid huh

795
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,895
This one time when I was a little boy

796
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,431
I wanted this clock

797
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
You

798
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,271
I'm sure you've seen those before

799
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:54,111
Kind of have a little Nutcracker figuring popping out of it every hour

800
01:03:55,135 --> 01:04:01,279
I would stare at it for a long time pressing my face against that display window at the store every afternoon

801
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,655
So I guess it's no surprise doctor that was the first lock I ever picked in my life

802
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,751
But I was caught in the act

803
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,543
And I never got that clock

804
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:18,175
However ever since that day picking locks sort of became my job

805
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,527
And it all started just because I wanted that stupid clock

806
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,367
Oh I wanted was that stupid clock

807
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,583
You should just tell them everything

808
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,655
Tell the police everything you know

809
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,447
Just make a fresh start of

810
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
Oh my

811
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,223
Who did it

812
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,807
Is it this monster

813
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,599
The one that you mentioned before

814
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:12,959
Do me a favor don't screw it up this time I went out of my way to set this one up for you

815
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:19,359
You know she's the daughter of a state legislator she is beautiful and intelligent all in one package in other words

816
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:25,759
Perfection well we'll see about that but you know what all kidding aside you're right

817
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:32,159
It is time for me to find someone of course I'm right the thing is that someone in your position

818
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:37,535
Is that a wife just seems like hey

819
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:45,215
I'm sure you've seen those before the kind that have a little Nutcracker figuring pop

820
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,751
But every hour

821
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:57,247
Excuse me about the clock in the window hey what's going on you're already late for your date what

822
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,807

Oh no

824
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:09,279
See see she left because you were late and it's all because you had to stop in that store

825
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:15,679
Oh too bad I'm sorry about that can you do me a favor and apologize for me

826
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:22,079
Oh wait hey turn my

Maybe if you give her a call right now she might come back

828
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:34,879
Who knows I want to stop by the hospital for a quick minute what at this hour

829
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:39,231
I've had it with you

830
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,735
Officer

831
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
Excuse me

832
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,551
Officer are you out there

833
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
Hello

834
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,767
I'm ready to confess but I prefer if Dr tenmo were present

835
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,119
Where you could have gone

836
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:34,271
Listen I know it's late but can I go see one of my patients

837
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,831
I found something special

838
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:57,055
Hey what's the matter are you all right

839
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:03,455
Instead

840
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:09,855
Mr Yonkers

841
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:29,055
Mr young girls

842
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:35,455
It's the last time there's some candy my patience disappearing

843
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:41,855
Just like 9 years ago

844
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:48,255
Mr Yonkers

845
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,919
Mr Yonkers

846
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,967
It's me

847
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,503
Dr tema

848
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,695
Stay away doctor

849
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,559
Let's go back to the hospital Mister Yonkers

850
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,351
Everything will be all right

851
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,703
Don't come any closer

852
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:36,127
I'm begging you please don't look at him

853
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:45,087
He's the one who killed my friends and I'll kill you too

854
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:55,327
Who are you oh God just run run away

855
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,167
Been a doctor

856
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:05,823
It's me 9 years ago

857
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:12,223
With my life

858
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:18,623
Have you forgotten already doctor about the twins

859
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,231
That's right

860
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,767
That twin

861
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,303
You remember

862
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:30,911
What do you think you're doing here Mr Jones is my patience let him go

863
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
What am I doing

864
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:44,991
In execution

865
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:53,695
We were hired by him he call us each time a large amount will be wired to our accounts after each job

866
01:10:53,951 --> 01:11:00,095
Stop why it seems like we're taking the money and split it we had it all figured out

867
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:06,495
The murder of those four middle-aged couples was ordered by it was you

868
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,311
The police started suspecting me and following me

869
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:15,711
He wanted to get rid of us listen to me the other two friends the Slayer and big boys have already

870
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:23,391
It means nothing to him

871
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,207
Johan don't do this

872
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,535
Mr gunquest doesn't know your identity but I do

873
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,839
How was your attending physician

874
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:36,191
You are so hun Liebert the Elder of fraternal twins

875
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,007
You are the son of Michael Liebert

876
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,799
Former advisor of Commerce

877
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,359
Who fled East Germany in 1986

878
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,663
Has a political Refugee to the West

879
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,967
If we know this much about you

880
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,015
You can't possibly Escape

881
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,319
Don't add your crimes Johan

882
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,879
Johan huh

883
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,951
Yes there was a time when I went by that name

884
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:05,887
But you know something doctor Johan isn't my real name what are you talking about

885
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:12,287
You must never know about my past not about those four couples

886
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:17,919
For the Liberty but you're different doctor

887
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:24,319
You cared for me and you restored me to life so I feel as though you're like a father to

888
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:30,719
Like a father truth is if it weren't for you I wouldn't be standing

889
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:37,119
Here right now

890
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:43,519
Why not because a human life is precious don't you see that

891
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,887
What are you laughing at

892
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:21,151
I heard you were promoted to chief of surgery soon after that incident

893
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,455
I'm really happy doctor

894
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,271
That you were promoted to that position

895
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,831
What are you trying to tell me

896
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:34,207
You are where you are today because the director and the others died right

897
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,023
I'm so glad I was able to help

898
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:43,423
That was a good thing

899
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,823
My God isn't that what you wanted Doctor that's what you said

900
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:56,223
Right after I regained Consciousness that's what you told me

901
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:02,623
That you hated them so much you wish they were dead all that I did was

902
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:09,023
To your wish doctor

903
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,823
God

904
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:47,423
I was supposed to

905
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,823
To die that night you're the one who resurrected me doctor

906
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:34,271
What a miserable downpour

907
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,831
I just spies the wet weather

908
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:41,183
All it does is wash away the crime scene evidence when you need it the most

909
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,231
Well wouldn't you agree

910
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
Dr timma

911
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:50,911
All right

912
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:53,983
To summarize what you told me so far

913
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,799
Just to make sure that we piece it all together

914
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:04,479
Back in 1986 Liebert a high government official escape from East Germany with his wife

915
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,247
Children

916
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:11,647
Right after they arrive the Liebert family was attacked the couple was killed in the twin brothers suffered a critical gunshot

917
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,671
Got wound to the Head

918
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,743
You were the surgeon in charge of his operation

919
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,303
And subsequently save the boy's life

920
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,911
But to everyone surprises fate would have it

921
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:29,311
The boy kills the director the chief of surgery and the head of neurosurgery with poison candy and then dis

922
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
Pierce

923
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:36,479
And last night after 9 long years out of the clear blue the Libra boy reappears and kills a state

924
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,295
Police officer with poison candy yet again

925
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:43,647
And right in front of your eyes he shoots Adolf Younkers your patient

926
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:50,303
He is none other than the very man that hired you and curse and two others to murder the four middle-aged couples across

927
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
Germany

928
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,607
And his name is

929
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,655
Johan Liebert

930
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,751
I believe that's the entire story isn't it

931
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,175
Yes

932
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,991
I think we're finished with the doctor he can go

933
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:20,255
I don't think that someone with Dr tennis credentials or in his position could be responsible for such a crime

934
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:26,655
He has an alibi for the time the policeman was killed and we didn't find any gunpowder residue on his hand

935
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,959
So much for key evidence

936
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:33,311
There go all of our leads to solving those murders of the four middle-aged

937
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,103
Inspector lung

938
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,943
Should we get started on this Johan Liebert for the time being
