Waste of my time you know that look who's talking to you

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:28,416
I've never been to a doctor in my entire life and I'm a healthy woman I'm very healthy Woman as a matter of fact

5
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,816
Now leave me alone

6
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
Yes what is it it's a drunk thing he got hit by a car out on the highway

7
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
Why when you left it was he still awake I'm not sure but some

8
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
I was treating them when I left somebody who just happened to be passing by I guess some

9
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,552
Nearby

10
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
So mind telling me what happened here oh he

11
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
Sister did he I'm so sorry I tried to stop him but he said he needed to take emergency measures because the patient

12
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
My choke to

13
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
Well who did he say he was

14
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,688
I don't know he never did tell me his name

15
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,760
Oh he did write something on the chart though

16
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,024
The patient kept pleading with me not to bring him to this Clinic because he said he had no money to pay for a doctor

17
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,352
Please take this to cover any medical expenses

18
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,192
Bastard who does he think he is

19
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,032
Doctor where you going this fella what did he look like

20
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
He was an Asian man and he had a little boy with him

21
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:01,088
Doctor what about Mr Fink there's nothing more I can do for him

22
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
Only took emergency measures to prevent choking yeah emergency measures my eyes that's stranger

23
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
Listen

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Dieter

You can't keep following me around like this it isn't going to work

26
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,520
I can never stay in just one place and you can't go to school like this

27
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,152
You won't make any friends and who is that

28
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,248
That isn't what I meant

29
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:11,648
Was it you well were you the one showing me up in my

30
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
Clinic

31
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,559
Keep your damn money maybe I'm just a country doctor but I take care of my own

32
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,143
I would never stoop so low as to charge that poor drunkard for treatment

33
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
Sir I just you're probably some big city doctor out on vacation I bet you're

00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,351
Guy who drinks too much we're looking for any Witnesses

00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
Good luck with that one

40
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
Oh hey there Dr Schumann

41
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
So how's things doing

42
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,151
Looks like he's going to pull through

43
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
I'm more worried about the bottle doing them in

44
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
And you are

45
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
Who am I

46
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Dr Chan

47
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
We're alumni from the same medical school he figured he dropped by The Village while he's on vacation

48
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Dr Chan

49
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Have you and I met somewhere before

50
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959
He took care of Fink actually since I was out making house calls

51
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
Good thing he was here yes sir speaking of house calls guess where I went again today where Heinz isn't it

52
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
Yes I'm talking about your mother Petra my mother

53
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
You need to tell her to come down to the clinic right away

54
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,647
There's no telling what may be wrong with her without a checkup there's no way she's too stubborn come on you know that

55
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,487
That woman won't listen to anybody

56
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Don't worry doc

57
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
Trust me mom's not going to die that easily what besides she raised me so what's left to do

58
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:04,287
When it's time she won't have any regrets what did you say bite your tongue

59
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,871
Petra has plenty of living to do do you hear me

60
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,319
Why did you lie to him

61
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,391
Because I never would have made it to think in time

62
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,999
No he'd be dead right now if you hadn't stepped in like you did

63
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
Thank you very much sir

64
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,399
You turned white as a sheet when you saw Heinz how come

65
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
Never mind

66
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,543
Least now I know you're not some hot shot doctor from the city

67
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
I'm in your debt sir I really do mean it

68
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,967
I don't know how I can ever pay you back is that so

69
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
Hop in the car I've got an idea

70
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,463
Your splint is misaligned I'll straighten it

71
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,863
This may hurt a bit but just hang in there

72
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
There you go I should do the trick don't let me cat

73
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
Since you not wearing that in the next two weeks hey Doc I made some smooth apple wine how about we drink to my new

74
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
I think that's an awful idea but I'll have a drink with you in the cast comes off

75
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
You should be fine 5 days and you can go back to the fields

76
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,863
Good news hi Mr Shawna why don't you take some potatoes we had a good crop this year

77
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:39,263
Afternoon with a truck

78
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,663
Thanks for the help my specialties internal medicine but I have to be a jack of all trades out here

79
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
I'm all the doctoring these folks get and there's only one of me it's wonderful

80
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
Tranquility is the one thing this place has in Spain no I didn't mean to land I mean

81
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,863
I mean how much you love all the people in this Village and at the same time how much they all seem to love you back

82
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
Love huh that ship sailed a long time ago

83
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,663
This is my job and that's why I do it well one last stop

84
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
You're a free man I save the best for last

85
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,463
Quit do you quit I don't even know the meaning of the word

86
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
How many times you come back just leave you quack

87
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:40,447
Like I'm talking to a mule mattress the mother of that officer who had you spooked

88
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
She collapsed 3 days ago working in the fields I talked her into coming down to the clinic but she changed her mind on the way

89
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,943
Stay over she's been holed up in there ever since that is worrisome

90
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
Not to butt in but do you mind if I try talking to her it's not going to make a look a difference

91
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
Don't tell me you're still standing out there you idiots

92
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,399
You have to come down she'll never come out if you keep yelling at her like that

93
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Understand the possibility of losing you

94
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:22,431
What I mean is I wouldn't have anyone to fight with anymore also I wouldn't be able to eat that gou

95
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,735
Clash of hers if that stubborn old thing passed on

96
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,087
Hey mister how come your face is red what did you say you little brat

97
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
Please miss Petra open the door

98
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,375
What did I say it's a waste of time

99
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
So tell me why do you hate doctors

100
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
Why do I hate doctors

101
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,031
I'll tell you why

102
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,615
You play God with people's lives that's why

103
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
God

104
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
So I wish

105
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
Sometimes I think it would be great if we were

106
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
And try our best but we make mistakes too

107
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Wouldn't it be great

108
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,999
If doctors could be perfect like God and just heal people

109
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:14,911
When I see my patience it's always the same on the inside I'm trembling like a leaf

110
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,983
Please miss Petra let me at least see you

111
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
Is that I'm smelling you're cooking up some goulash in here aren't you why you asking you like

112
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:46,911
Goulash or something I do but it seems that Dr Schumann is a particularly big fan of it at least

113
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:53,311
That's what he told me anyway well that's news to me I always make it for him and he eats it but he never says a word

114
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:59,711
He's very shy this looks really delicious my goodness my shoulders are so

115
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:06,111
And I still have a lot of food to prepare for tonight's dinner Miss Petra

116
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:12,511
Can you touch your chin down to your chest of course I can't easy enough to do watch

117
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,911
Let me just check something man

118
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,055
Four fingers wide oh nothing

119
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
How is she

120
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
It isn't good

121
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,343
A subarachnoid hemorrhage what did you say

122
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,719
Hey Hines the fax came in for a murder suspect make some copies

123
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,583
Is your mom okay I heard that she had a fading spell three days ago she's all right

124
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655
Yeah that tough old lady is going to outlive all of us

125
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,847
The first stroke occurred less than three days ago

126
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:05,247
We can still make it but we need to operate immediately can we get a helicopter here in time

127
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
Can you do it please if you can perform this operation

128
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
Then do it if you can't they're my feelings will have lost me the woman I love for a second

129
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,631
Time

130
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,103
Are you sure that it's Kensington positive all right he probably hasn't gone far set up checkpoints

131
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
Along the highway if we catch this guy it'll be big Hines yes sir prepare for emergency

132
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,903
Deployment great if things go well I'll get promoted

133
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,303
Have a call this is speaking

134
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,703
No the nurse from the clinic are you kidding me my mother collapsed again

135
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,847
God why didn't I drag her into town if they had checked her at the state hospital I wouldn't have come to this

136
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,967
You're the only one who can save her

137
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,367
Just as I suspected it's an aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery

138
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,719
We don't even have a surgical microscope or a cranial here

139
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,791
I can still do it as long as I have an aneurysm clip

140
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
No it's too difficult even for someone of your caliber

141
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
We've got no other option here

142
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,543
If the aneurysm ruptures I'm afraid she's not going to survive the night

143
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,383
It's my fault this is happening again

144
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:43,039
What are you talking about Dr Schumann those aren't the words of a man who single-handedly taken care of this entire town

145
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,623
I don't know what happened in the past but

146
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,743
You have to do the best job you can do right now that's all we as doctors can do

147
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Yeah

148
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Hey kid Dr schumann's inside isn't he he's operating

149
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:15,039
Why are they doing it here at this Clinic instead of taking her to the hospital in town hey don't worry

150
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,743
How's her blood pressure and pulse blood pressure

151
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,327
Propulses 88

152
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,727
Amazing he's so fast and efficient even without the benefit of a craniotone

153
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
What the hell are you doing we're operating on your mother isn't that

154
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,527
Obvious what are you doing with that gun put your hands up do it if he stops

155
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
He killed a man in Heidelberg and he's the prime suspect in

156
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,191
Cereal murders of those couples who would have thought that I'd find you here

157
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
Leave it to good old mom always looking for new ways to help out our boy now put your hands up Timba

158
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,919
If you don't I'll shoot like hell you will

159
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:20,319
This is a sterile operating room or it was until you came barging in do you want your mother to die of meningitis

160
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
Cuz it's very likely to happen if you keep standing there then stop the operation

161
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,351
If we don't save her now she dies

162
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
Now get out of here Hines no way I'm on to you just

163
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
Waiting on using my mom is a hostage so you can run away from here all right now please

164
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
Aneurysm clip in forceps now that's my mother on that table I won't

165
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:57,439
Did anyone hurt her yes Petra is your mother and you're her son

166
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
But what kind of sun have you been to her these past 5 years I know you didn't visit her once since you left for the city

167
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,935
Years later Petra sets out a dish for you

168
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
I should know I'm the one who eats it

169
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,311
Remember how delicious it is

170
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
He's giving it everything he's got so if you ever

171
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,831
I want to taste that goulash again you'll get out of here now

172
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,183
C10 was there so it's okay

173
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,399
Blood pressure 140 over 86 pulse 82

174
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Good

175
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
Her Vital Signs have stabilized

176
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,311
Why don't you get some rest Misty on you

177
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,127
God like you haven't I'll be just fine

178
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
Yes sir you did well today

179
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,271
Dr Tama you should get some rest too

180
00:16:54,527 --> 00:17:00,671
Don't worry about me I'm fine you're fine that was a grueling operation you must be dead on your feet I want

181
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Stay and make sure she pulls through

182
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,327
That way when Miss Petra has recovered enough you can go ahead and finally propose to her

183
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
What do you mean for pose

184
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
Hey I thought you were supposed to be asleep

185
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,591
I'm not sleeping not until I take him down to the station

186
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
What's he talking about anyway

187
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,247
You're not thinking about marrying my mom are you of course not

188
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Don't be stupid

189
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
Even if I did

190
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,695
I'm not the kind of man who's worthy of proposing to anyone

191
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,863
I used to work at the University Hospital didn't give a damn about any of my patients

192
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,655
All I cared about what a cliche

193
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,311
Well I moved up that damn ladder all right and ignored her like the wrong she was if

194
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,711
I had been a real doctor or showing her the least bit of attention I'd have known in a moment

195
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,831
My wife came down with a simple cold at least that's what I wrote it off as

196
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
If only I had looked at her I would have seen it an intern would have seen it severe liver

197
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,887
Before she died she said I finally have your

198
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Define detention

199
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
I don't deserve to love anybody after what I did to that poor woman

200
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
That's not true you have been paying attention doctor you've been watching over the people of this

201
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,415
Petra is going to survive this because you were watching

202
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,615
Do you still plan on taking this man to jail he did everything in his power last night to save

203
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
What kind of murderer would do that

204
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
Heights

205
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
This is Hines get me the chief chief I made a mistake

206
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,399
I'm sorry we should cancel this search the man I saw before was not Tenma

207
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:23,775
He was another doctor by the name of Chan I thought it was him because he was Asian

208
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
Yes that's right

209
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
Yes yes sir I'm very sorry

210
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
The doctor from the state hospital sure did

211
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
Being surprised well of course he did he probably never expected to see such amazing results from a little clinic in

212
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:46,815
Dr Schumann are you really going to let that young doctor leave

213
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:51,423
I was making him something to eat but he packed his bags and left with the kid

214
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:05,247
Don't go this town is safe for you there's no need to run away

215
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
Dr Schumann what are you

216
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
This is a nice Village isn't it you're right this Village may be a very good place for a boy like Peter here

217
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,839
But not only for him you could stop running you'll be off the radar if you stay

218
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:28,031
The folks in this Village need more than I can give them on my own together there's no end to the good we could do

219
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:33,407
I can't I'm sorry but I really have to be moving on but why

220
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,063
Take care of Peter he's better off here

221
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,463
What's more important than that

222
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,863
Save countless lives before I do that

223
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,263
As a man whose life I have to end what what are you

224
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,663
You can't mean that no damage you're a good man 10

225
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,063
You fought like hell to say Petra's life why you're not a killer

226
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:18,464
Tim was going to go no matter what you say to him

227
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
Go take care of him Peter

228
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
If you stay with 10 amount maybe you can keep him from going down the wrong path go with him and look after him

229
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:40,928
How many times do you plan on coming here you can ask me until you're blue in the face I'm always going to tell you the same thing

230
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:45,280
Look councilman boltzmann didn't have sex with that woman that prostitute

231
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
This had better be your last visit

232
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,912
I would hate to have to take action against you take action

233
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,960
Are you going to sue for defamation

234
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
No

235
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
You wouldn't dare

236
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
You're a secretary

237
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,152
You wouldn't want councilman boltzman's name to come up in a case like this

238
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,968
Inspector are you threatening me

239
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
No of course not

240
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,576
I simply want to know the truth of the matter that's all

241
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,560
John

242
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:24,960
Have you decoded her client list for me actually we're still working on cracking that code it's a lot

243
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
Tougher than we thought

244
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,384
I'll do it myself just give me the disc great but don't you already have a bunch of

245
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,968
Much of other cases on your plate it doesn't matter give it to me

246
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,600
There's something I've been meaning to ask you for a while what is it

247
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:47,232
Well how do you find the time to sleep what does that have to do with the case

248
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
It's an irrelevant question Detective

249
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,264
Well have you gotten the chance to talk to him it doesn't really matter when we tell

250
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,664
He doesn't listen he stopped listening to me a long time ago I know but the sooner you tell him the

251
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,968
Better keep it down you're being too loud

252
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:14,368
He's here you know working in his office yeah I wonder why

253
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:27,168
Damn it are you still trying to connect councilman boltzmann to the

254
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,568
The murder of that prostitute is there a problem with that chief

255
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:39,968
From the ministry of the Interior you're just going to have to smooth things out like you usually do no I can't

256
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,320
It's too big do whatever you can chief

257
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:50,208
Give me a break here Loom gay you're good but you're only human sometimes you're going to be wrong

258
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,304
Are you going to risk your entire career on a dead hooker

259
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,376
Come on do you need another feather in your cap

260
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,656
Oh

261
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,984
Don't tell me you're doing this for the principle of the thing

262
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Justice

263
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,336
I'm not interested in either

264
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,432
All I know is a woman was murdered in Cold Blood

265
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,272
I'm just interested in finding the killer nothing else matters to me

266
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:29,632
Excuse me inspector you have a visitor got it

267
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:36,032
I managed to figure out the encryption that she was using use this formula to get all the names on our Client List

268
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:42,432
Oh that woman is here again sir you know the one

269
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,832
Hey you can't just come back here we've been over this before

270
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,392
When will 10 be arrested you have all you need

271
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:57,792
It seems like you've been drinking quite a bit this morning just so you know

272
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,888
I've already figured out the case regarding Dr Tenma

273
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,472
He insists that everything is the work of a man called Johan

274
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:10,080
But this Johann is just another personality within 10ma's mind

275
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:15,200
If you think about it with this hypothesis what seemed illogical now makes sense

276
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,552
Well we have to do at this point is just wait for the police to capture him

277
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:26,208
So that means it's not your problem once you got an arrest warrant is that what you're saying there are a lot of things I would like to

278
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
To ask him when we finally meet

279
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
Doctor Tenma

280
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,352
What an interesting individual he is

281
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:37,216
However I have so many other cases piling up on my desk as we speak

282
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
If you'll excuse me

283
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,432
Don't you people ever let up

284
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,552
I told you councilman boltzman has an alibi for that night

285
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
Of course he did

286
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,880
The murder was a professional

287
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
I'm sorry

288
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,304
Are you honestly suggesting that my employer hired a hit man to kill that girl ridiculous I've cracked the

289
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,704
Code on the list of clients of the woman who was killed councilman boltzman's name was on that

290
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
That list

291
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:14,592
You know even if that were the case it still doesn't prove that he had her killed

292
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:22,016
Right come to think of it that's as far as we've gotten I'm sure you'll be in touch now leave

293
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:30,208
We're dead in the water without a Smoking Gun wouldn't you say are you familiar with a Publishing House called

294
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
Longhorn

295
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,144
They're not a major company but they stay in business by publishing tell all books on famous people like Pol

296
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Petitions

297
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,216
They're known to play very dirty

298
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
They hire unscrupulous women to build relationships with famous men in order to create scandals

299
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
To write about

300
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
If I were you

301
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,224
I'd watch out for people like that

302
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:19,872
Check and mate you should have seen it it was great boltzman's guy just stared at him like what

303
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,224
Blunque is unbelievable near as I can tell all he does is work

304
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,272
He's a robot I'm telling you

305
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
Man I hear you

306
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,600
The guy barely seems human to me

307
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,304
All right speaking of Checkmate there it is what the hell hey don't put into our game buddy

308
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,704
You shouldn't waste your time with my numbing games it seems after a simple little threat the

309
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,264
President of the Publishing Company chose to confess

310
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,824
Write a report

311
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
Here

312
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
What do you think you're looking at

313
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
It's at call girls notebook it records the date and time and other details of encounters with a certain

314
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,976
Client I can't really tell you the man's name

315
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,792
He's only referred to here by the initial b

316
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:16,192
Not to mention shellhorn publishing also made arrangements with the woman to release her autobiography

317
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
Interesting

318
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
Don't you think

319
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
Oh by the way

320
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,944
Have you ever been in contact with a man named yanker you may be aware that he is a professional Hitman

321
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,552
I want you to leave

322
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,464
You get the hell out of here now

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,064
Care I bet you didn't even notice that I was having an affair with another man did you

326
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:23,264
Understood

327
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,664
I have to go we can talk about this later

328
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,864
Inspector what just happened here

329
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:17,024
Councilman Boltzmann's an innocent man

330
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,840
Not much of a suicide note but that's all we got

331
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
Looney

332
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,472
I'm handing this one over to inspector Kaminski

333
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:31,360
I'm giving him the reichner park in gallon murder cases too given what happened I think it's for the best

334
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,432
So then what am I supposed to do now

335
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,856
Get your head together

336
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
Then we'll talk about work

337
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,904
Well Dr Tenma it seems there's nothing left to distract me

338
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,304
Sorry inspector you have

339
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,704
Have a visitor it's a behind a man but I could tell her to come back another day if you know

340
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
No sure in

341
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:53,280
I had a great time Eva

342
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:58,400
How long until next time not sure babe

343
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:04,800
Maybe when I return from my next business trip

344
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,848
All right

345
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:13,248
I'll give you a call

346
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:19,648
No you won't be coming back not after getting in trouble for that perfumed handkerchief that I carefully placed

347
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:23,232
Suitcase you stupid bastard

348
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,144
You were eavesdropping again weren't you

349
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,544
You must see all the different men I'm with isn't that right well what then you want to join in the

350
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,944
Fun is that it no of course not you pervert you're wrong but I mean I just I

351
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,320
Get how nice it is it's beautiful I really love this Garden

352
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:55,232
Looking at all this Greenery helps me forget about the distasteful things out there

353
00:38:55,488 --> 00:39:01,632
I'm so glad that you like it I'm going to plant some mimosas here and over there I'm planning to put up an arch for

354
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:08,032
When summer gets here it's going to be beautiful like you could be up to the

355
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,432
So what do you think do you think you can make me happy

356
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
Hey Dad are you listening to me

357
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
Dad

358
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:27,232
Oh how is my cooking today am I getting any better

359
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,304
You haven't heard a single word I said have you Dad

360
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:34,912
How come you're always daydreaming I bet you that's why Mom ran off with another man

361
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
I'm sorry

362
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
It's fine

363
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
Really

364
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,456
Actually

365
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
Colet

366
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
Yeah

367
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,600
If Daddy found

368
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,648
Someone he really liked

369
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,976
No forget it it's nothing

370
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,304
My cooking is pretty awful right come on tell the truth

371
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
It's not so bad

372
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
I see

373
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
Not bad huh

374
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Sorry for the trouble

375
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:13,056
You're a gardener but I'm asking you to do all these odd jobs no problem

376
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:16,128
My handyman kept asking for time off and then quit

377
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,688
Well I'll do everything I can to help

378
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,088
So how about dinner tonight

379
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Well

380
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
Okay

381
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,984
Why are you nervous

382
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
Well I'm not used to expensive restaurants like this you must be

383
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,784
Confident wherever you go just pretend you're working in my garden right now yes

384
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,184
That's right I do feel pretty confident when I'm out there working on something new in the yard I Feel So Satisfied

385
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,584
You want a garden turns out the way I envisioned it I just love being out there you know people who like Gardens can't

386
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,984
Be all that bad and you did say you like that Garden the other day you're trying to say that I'm a good person

387
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
Yeah of course but you well go on

388
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,712
You seem you know kind of lonely

389
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,344
I'm not the only one

390
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,720
I'm guessing that you're lonely too

391
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
I'm sorry

392
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,807
My daughter's probably worried about me so I should get going

393
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Cancel

394
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:23,871
It's almost Christmas Coletta he doesn't have to come this year

395
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:30,271
Hey come on sweetie don't say things like that Dad celebrating Christmas

396
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:36,671
Let's not do anything okay just be the two of us celebrating this year you know

397
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,007
The man you're looking at in those photographs ruined my life

398
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,823
Sorry I was just cleaning up

399
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,871
His name is Kenzo tema

400
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
He's my ex fiance

401
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:04,063
You're drinking again at this time of day well of course I've been drinking I just went to see inspector

402
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,719
Can you believe that useless incompetent inspector sent me away

403
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,791
All I want to know is when they're going to arrest them

404
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
The pka

405
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
The rest

406
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,263
He killed my father and then ran away oh he says he's innocent but he's not fooling anybody

407
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:29,919
My future should have been gilded and gold as the daughter of the director of a large hospital and my three divorces

408
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:36,319
Everything is his fault and he blames the murders on your home this is Johan with my father do

409
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,135
Think that this child could kill anyone

410
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:43,487
Is that really what timma told you

411
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:49,887
Have you ever shown this Photograph to the police I don't know it

412
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,959
Be important evidence Maybe

413
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,799
Lego says he has a split personality dammit

414
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,871
Then tell me

415
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:04,223
Why do you still keep framed pictures of them like this around the house years later

416
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
I figured deep down

417
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,087
You think Tema is innocent

418
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
You still have

419
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,439
Feelings for him

420
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,535
You watch too many so

421
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,727
Out of all the men I've ever met Kenzo satisfied the most of my requirements his position suited me

422
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:32,127
He was an elite neurosurgeon who many considered a genius besides he spoiled me and best of all he never

423
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:38,527
Contradicted me he just listened to my every single request yes yes he was the man who

424
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:44,927
Well we said yes to me that man could have made me the happiest person in the world do you understand what I'm saying

425
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,463
Do you think

426
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:52,863
I would ever be able to fill his shoes I'd be willing to tend your Gardens for the

427
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,143
Rest of my life

428
00:44:54,399 --> 00:45:00,543
If that would help to ease your pain any

429
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,879
Knocked out flatter yourself just because I slept with you once you were just something to pass the time I was bored

430
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:21,279
I was playing with you and you fell for it you fool who Do You Think You Are

431
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:27,679
Truly a sad and lonely person

432
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:34,079
So are you

433
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:40,479
On Christmas Day I'm having a party at my house with my daughter you're welcome to join us

434
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,023
Well Dad everything looks delicious

435
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,071
Did you really make this all by yourself

436
00:45:55,327 --> 00:46:00,191
Yep I can't guarantee it'll be good

437
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,751
Do you think so

438
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,615
Mom's coming home for Christmas

439
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
Charlotte

440
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,055
Mommy

441
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,847
I'm so sorry to

442
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
I'm sorry

443
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:31,327
Who cares about mimosas or about Frozen or beautiful gardens

444
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,727
Devastate none of it means anything to me now just let it burn

445
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Welcome back

446
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:01,023
So inspector loon gay you finally decided to listen to me

447
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:07,935
I had some time open up that's all this man was my only hope I must see to it that his life

448
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:12,287
Is ruined or I can never be happy again
