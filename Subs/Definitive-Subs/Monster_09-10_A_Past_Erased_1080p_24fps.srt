1
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,056
Formerly served in the French Foreign Legion

2
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,176
Then when freelance and fought in Nicaragua in 1979

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,576
From 1981 to 1984 assisted the Guerrilla rebels in Afghanistan

4
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
Then in 1987 you played a key role in the assassination of radical Islamic leaders in

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,280
Top secret moussard operation

6
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,376
It's quite an impressive resume I must admit

7
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
Isn't it Mr Hugo Bernhard

8
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
I have no doubt that a mercenary of your caliber must be quite a teacher and I'm sure a number of distinguished

9
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,200
Men must have been under your instruction

10
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
It might be a good idea to send some of our own officers to attend your seminar and have you with them into shape

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
That'd be great

12
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
Incidentally

13
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,376
Was this man here a good student by any chance

14
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,960
I believe he showed up at your training grounds about 5 months ago

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
We know that he is a genius with a scalpel

16
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,920
What I'm wondering about is whether he has any Talent with a gun

17
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,808
I don't divulge information about my pupils to anyone period

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
Of course you don't

19
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
So have you ever trained with a gun before

20
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,528
No I guess that means that you're self taught then

21
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Actually

22
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,856
I've never shot a gun before

23
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,696
What you mean not even once right

24
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
I know I'm asking for the impossible

25
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,583
Matt said you're my only hope right now

26
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
It makes no difference

27
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,239
I make all my students forget everything they learned before they got here

28
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
But this

29
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,407
This is the first time I'll be teaching someone who's never shot a gun before

30
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Jump rope

31
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:13,343
Regardless of your experience or lack of this is where everyone starts now jump like that child over there

32
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
Don't just stand there

33
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
Well get started yes sir

34
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
Faster now hurry it up

35
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
I said faster

36
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
Balance it's all about balance

37
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
Come on faster

38
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
I said faster

39
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,639
Well obviously I can't jump rope nearly as well as you do

40
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:50,111
Tell me something is this what you do you know always supervising student training like this

41
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,023
All right I understand you don't have to keep on staring at me like that

42
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
I'll do it

43
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:05,471
I know what I have to do

44
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Hey it's a branding

45
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,319
I wonder if it's looking for food for its chicks

46
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
What's wrong are you too tired to eat

47
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Yes

48
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
You can't train if you pass out

49
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Yes sir

50
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
She your daughter

51
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Or your granddaughter Maybe

52
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
Neither

53
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
That little girl is the daughter of a woman

54
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
I killed

55
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
Shut her down right before very

56
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Backing me on

57
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
On Mission in the jungle I ran into a hut

58
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
For shelter

59
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
And there she was with her mother

60
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,199
If I'd have been a fraction of a second slower it would have been me that died that day

61
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,039
I brought the child back here with me I couldn't just leave her

62
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
From that moment on

63
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
She hasn't smiled once

64
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
That's why

65
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,583
She'll probably hate me for the rest of her life

66
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,751
That's the sort of thing that happens when you have a gun

67
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,615
Now if you can't handle that then I'd suggest you don't carry one

68
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
What a person sometimes it smells just like Daphne blossoms

69
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:29,311
Thanks

70
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
All right that's enough of that

71
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
So then

72
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
Time for some more running

73
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
Go

74
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
Yes sir

75
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
Right away then

76
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,215
When you're done running come to the bottom of the hill in the back

77
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
What's down there the firing range

78
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
The firing range

79
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Remember

80
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
Two shots

81
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:16,671
You have to make sure that whenever you fire your gun you always pull the trigger twice if you can do that instinctively it better is

82
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
Chances of taking out your objective

83
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
If you can't do that

84
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,607
Then you're as good as Dad it's all over

85
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
What's this about

86
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
You're always preparing meals for me so I thought it would cook for you today it's a Japanese stew of meat and potatoes

87
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:30,911
It's called nicujaga go on dig in I think you'll both enjoy it those are chopstick

88
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
They're carved out of wood I made them I thought it would make our dining experience more authentic

89
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
Wow

90
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,207
You're really good at using Chopsticks aren't you

91
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
Again faster

92
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Do it again

93
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
What's wrong

94
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
It's a baby brambling

95
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
I guess it fell out of its nest

96
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,727
No wait you have to put it back

97
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
That chick is going to die

98
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:51,455
It's very difficult to raise them like that they rarely survive for that long outside of the nest

99
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,367
Let's put it back

100
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,671
Back with its mother okay

101
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
3 seconds

102
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
That's all the time you've got

103
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,703
Find your target and pull the trigger cuz one mistake of the slightest bit of hesitation and you're dead

104
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,479
Tell me how well did he perform over those 5 months he was there training with you

105
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,039
Technically speaking he was a perfect student

106
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,343
He built up the necessary stamina

107
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,671
And his concentration while firing was extraordinary

108
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
However

109
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
However

110
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,583
Being able to actually shoot a person is another story

111
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Really

112
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,191
Whether or not he is successful on his first kill

113
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,751
That's what it all comes down to

114
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
Either he's got what it takes

115
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Already

116
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
Yes I see

117
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,175
I wonder which road this man will choose

118
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
Well it matters not

119
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Tell me

120
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
Do you have any idea where he might have gone

121
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,535
Because if you do know where I would really like for you to tell me

122
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,431
Thanks for all you've done for me over the past 5 months

123
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
Here's the remaining tuition I owe

124
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
And please help yourself to the necojaga

125
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
Again

126
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Thank you for everything

127
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Damn it

128
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Damn it

129
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:58,079
So how about it you do know where this man was heading don't you

130
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,063
That I can't tell you

131
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,719
That's fine you can go now

132
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,215
This way sir

133
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:41,504
One man have a ball

134
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,576
Wait a second where's the Cherry

135
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
It's not a Manhattan without the Cherry

136
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
Yeah my mistake

137
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
I'll let it slide

138
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
This time

139
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,056
Business always goes well when I'm sucking on one of these

140
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,384
A lucky charm is a lucky charm

141
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
Come to Papa

142
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,488
I just hope there's still something of value we're taking

143
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,056
Well well look at what we've got here

144
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,616
It's a five finger free for all

145
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:44,224
Wonder if there's anything valuable enough for a connoisseur like Auto Hackle

146
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
You never know what's going to happen first year issue in Canada for governor next thing you and your

147
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Can't get shot

148
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
LOL

149
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
Down to business

150
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
I'm guessing this is where they kept the safe

151
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,944
Why am I getting a chill this is creepy as hell I've never felt anything like this could

152
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
Could somebody be in there

153
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,440
What am I so scared about it ain't like me to be a chicken move

154
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
Put your hands behind your head

155
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,912
Oh man I can't believe this damn bartender at his fault

156
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
Forgot the Cherry

157
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
I said put your hands up all right all right all right give me a break on this one officer I

158
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,640
Taking anything yet I promise

159
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
I'm not a cop

160
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
No

161
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
So you're robbing the place too huh

162
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,856
Well in that case why don't you just put that thing away and we'll have ourselves behind your head now

163
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,280
James what's with this guy's a bigger boy scout than the freaking cops

Kidding me thanks for nothing buddy come out of here don't follow me someone like you just

00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:14,080
It's in the way you call me down

00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:26,880
That's right I thought I recognized you you're all over the papers you're the doctor wanted for questioning

167
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
Meaning connection with councilman Springs Missouri are you a thief

Hey doctor you're some sort of top notch surgeon aren't you my brilliant

171

Changes came up with a fantastic idea do you think that people meet by chance doctor they don't

172
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:05,280
Believe me I know I believe in fate I think people meet for a reason and my gut tells me

173
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
Destined to become Partners call me crazy but I think a lot of folks in the underground

174
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:18,080
Did he need someone like you you know guys who need to hide out so they can't go to regular doctors for help

175
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:24,480
Listen you leave the management to Old Heckle here I'll make you the world's best underground doctor in no time I'm

This is if I were you you want to know about the murders in that house don't you well I guess you'd like to

179
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:50,080
I hear that I saw the killer am I right what did you say are you telling me the truth

180
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:56,480
You want to know what's the Killer Blonde and about 20 years of age

181
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,624
Never mind you just tell me about who you saw there team up with me and I'd be happy to doctor

182
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
He's on the third floor

183
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,024
So how did you come to know all of this anyway

184
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
I spent a month checking out the councilman's house case in the joint I do my homework just when I'm ready to make a move

185
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Killer beats me to it

186
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,544
15 minutes later I look in the window and they're dead worm food

187
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,408
And when I figured I might be able to Blackmail the murderer so I followed him here

188
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:31,808
This is all you really need to prove your innocence doc know what I'm saying all you have to do is call the police and tell him

189
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
After that we should go somewhere

190
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
Sit down relax talk over a drink about our future together as partners hey

191
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,656
Stop what are you doing what do you want to talk to him for what did you miss the part where he murders people

192
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,752
Man what is he thinking looking for trouble like that I'm out of here

193
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
However

194
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
A cash cow like him is a rare opportunity

195
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,528
Damn I usually make it a rule not to stick my neck out but

196
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:35,040
Another hot afternoon isn't it I

197
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:41,440
I'm actually looking for someone

198
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:47,840
There doctor what are you doing he's got a gun

199
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:54,240
Mother and I we often used to go walking together

200
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,640
On summer afternoons a lot like this one there was a long road we took and alongside of the

201
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:07,040
Field of sunflowers but mother's dead now this is important so I need you to listen did someone ask

202
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:13,440
To use that gun tell me was it a man was it a man it was one day

203
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:18,816
This young man came up to me at a local bar and was he about 20 years old with blonde hair

204
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:23,936
He was and he had a Big Bright Beautiful Smile called himself a

205
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
So he's going by Eric now

206
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,848
We met a few times and we eventually became very close friends

207
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,664
He invited me over to the place where he was staying

208
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,224
It was the estate of councilman Springer

209
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,784
Did he live in that Mansion until recently

210
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,600
Yes he did for a year in fact

211
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,928
He said they took good care of him he was like a son to them

212
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,792
Wait a minute I had my eye on that house for a month it never saw anyone who looked like that

213
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
They were a wonderful family

214
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,888
I have a picture

215
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,704
The councilman is wife and me

216
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
However

217
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,800
There was something I couldn't forgive them for

218
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,944
There was a beautiful area on their property a bit of sunflowers in their yard

219
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,552
But one day the councilman cleared it all up in order to build a bigger driveway

220
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:17,440
So when I mentioned to my young friend that I thought it was awful I was delighted to discover he agreed

221
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,536
Wait are you saying you actually killed them because of some flowers

222
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Hardly

223
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,352
There was more to it

224
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,448
He also told me councilman Springer had a mistress

225
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
That's when my friend looked at me and said

226
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,384
I've decided I no longer wish to live with or be a member of the Springer household

227
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,968
From now on I'm not a part of that family anymore

228
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,296
Then he proceeded to request of me

229
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
That I erase

230
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
The family

231
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,232
Having a mistress is so an excusable

232
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,328
My mother was someone's mistress too she was a kept woman you know

233
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,984
Listen listen don't think about all that stuff by the way do you know where the safest in that house I believe

234
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,544
Leave on the second floor in the library

235
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
All right then

236
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,408
Talk to you probably shouldn't stick around here

237
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:19,136
You can erase your past did you know that if you don't like it you can erase everything

238
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:25,536
You can erase all of it and reset your entire life if you want sorry I don't

239
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
Don't agree with that at all you may try to forget but no one can simply erase their past like that

240
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:38,336
Yeah I guess you're right I wonder why I thought that it

241
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:44,736
Doesn't make any sense to me now why did I think I could erase the past by pulling the trigger

242
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:51,136
Looking back I wonder why I listened to him and did what he asked me

243
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:57,536
I think you should go now our talk is over I have nothing more to say

244
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:03,936
Oh that's right your name is

245
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:10,336
Isn't it he left a message behind for you to make sure you take

246
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:16,736
Good look at it you'll find it in the councilman's library he predicted that you would come

247
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:23,136
I'm here and he was correct about that Eric also mentioned to me your fate has already been

248
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:29,536
Decided for you so has mine

249
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,328
Doctor

250
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,168
I told you didn't I

251
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
Did you actually shoot this guy

252
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,360
Oh suicide I got you

253
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
What the hell

254
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,368
What's the use in dying

255
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,184
Everything's over when you're dead it makes no sense

256
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,584
Hey doctor there's nothing like living am I right you know I think I actually agree with you for a change hey what exactly

257
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
Really do you mean for a change

258
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,264
Anyway so you're after this killer named Johanna whatever I don't get it I really don't know why you do that

259
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,104
Hey why don't you forget about this nonsense in team up with me

260
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:22,016
Oh by the way I don't know why but when I try to open the door to this room before it kind of gave me the cre

261
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264

268
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:29,344

269
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:36,512

Well you're wrong doctor what I did have meaning there was a good reason for what I did

312
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
Now that

313
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,096
The president of gwe is dead I can finally die in peace

314
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,448
I really don't mind I achieved what I set out to do

315
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
Counselor

316
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,800
I used to be a lawyer in East Germany

317
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,360
My friend here was a political secretary

318
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
And when the Wall came down

319
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
We lost our jobs

320
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
Do you have any idea what it is like for us after the wall felt gwe came to the

321
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
With their big funding

322
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,512
They barged in and built these factories on our land

323
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,560
One after another

324
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,376
That was our country Our Land

325
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,424
They had no right to do that

326
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
They stepped all over our pride

327
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,824
Well I'm proud to have shot that bastard

328
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896

00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
