1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,608
My wife and I divorced about 3 years ago

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,656
No that's a

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,936
She divorced

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,960
3 years ago

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:13,312
She said that I stopped listening to her and I suppose she was right about that

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,896
This was the only thing I did really listen to by that point

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
My wife said I was broken

8
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,064
She said it was a Voyer peeking through the window and people's innermost thoughts

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
Crazy

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,440
You're abnormal

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,256
Maybe you're right about that

12
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,912
I became transfixed obsessively gazing into the abyss of the human heart I suppose it's possibly hibiscus back

13
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:43,008
Into me the depths of the human mind are filled with treacherous landscapes

14
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,872
Your fourth victim was an 18 year old girl in Munich I believe

15
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,408
I'm curious

16
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,992
Did you experience any form of sexual arousal when you cut her up

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,672
I don't want to talk about her today doctor I want to talk about my 12th victim

18
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,208
Fair enough then

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,536
That would be Mrs Hunter Kemp from crupp House

20
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
52 years old

21
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
At that time

22
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,912
I was in

23
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,960
I'm not prepared to talk about her

24
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,360
I promise we will eventually get to Mrs Kemp but for the moment I would really like to focus on victim number 11

25
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
Is that all right

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
No then

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,224
The peak of your arousal

28
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,064
Does that come before or after you commit a murder

29
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,712
The victims were all girls with long hair

30
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
Ages 16 to 18

31
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,136
Clear these murders should all be categorized as acts of sexual homicide

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,720
But then he confesses to the murder of his 12th victim

33
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
Mrs Kem

34
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
Mrs Kemp was 52

35
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
And showed no signs of sexual assault

36
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,216
He claims to have killed Mrs Camp as a favor for a friend

37
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,056
And obvious in Desperate last ditch attempt to disrupt the investigation

38
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Who is it

39
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
Who is it I know that you're in there

40
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
It's me Rudy

41
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,800
This is a surprise yeah I know

42
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm sorry for barging in on you like this Rudy

43
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
You've heard about my situation

44
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,456
That's putting it mildly

45
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Well

46
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Do you think I'm a serial killer

47
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
I don't know

48
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
But from what I've heard

49
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,488
Both the newspapers and our old classmates think you're as guilty as Sin

50
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
So the question is

51
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
What are you doing here

52
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Why come to me

53
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
We were never exactly what you'd call close

54
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
I know for a fact you despise me

55
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
I could tell from the way you looked at me

56
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,687
I saw the contempt burning behind your eyes

57
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
Haha that's what this is all about

58
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
You've come to collect what you think I owe you

59
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:47,999
Is that it it's not like that at all you've become a noted specialist in criminal psychology

60
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
I have something

61
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
I'd like you to take a look at it

62
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
My dear Dr Tim

63
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Look at me

64
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Look at me

65
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,847
The monster inside me is getting bigger

66
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Help

67
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,223
The Munster inside me is about to explode

68
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
What on Earth is this

69
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Quite a story

70
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,791
So 10 years ago you saved Boys Life who went on to kill the hospital directors some staff and his foster parents

71
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,399
Then he's gone leaving no Trace other than a series of cryptic messages addressed to you

72
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,727
Which is why it's so urgent that I find out where he is now

73
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,359
Because you think by finding him you'll also find something that might prove your innocence

74
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:43,039
20 years ago

75
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,623
There was a young man attending a prestigious medical school

76
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:53,535
He was driven to be top of his class one day a Japanese transfer student came and changed

77
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
Everything

78
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
This new student was Charming quickly gaining the respective peers and teachers alike he had a brilliant mind as well

79
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:08,127
No claiming his position as the top of his class within his first semester much to the men's dismay by the

80
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
The next semester he had become obsessed with regaining his title he had managed to earn full marks and all his classes so

81
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,927
So far however his last test was in his weakest subject Medical

82
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
The law

83
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:28,095
If he failed this test then all of his efforts would go to waste

84
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,495
So he resorted to Desperate Measures measures

85
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
I thought would put them back on top but he was caught

86
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:47,295
The Japanese student

87
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
Never told anyone about what he had seen

88
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
As a result

89
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,975
The man regained his throne

90
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,631
So is there anything you can tell me about this man based on the contents of these letters

91
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,191
You think it may be multiple personality disorder

92
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,895
And you've come to the conclusion that one of the personalities is committing these murders while the other personality is trying to get

93
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,039
Yes instances of serial killers leaving these sorts of notes or not unheard

94
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,415
Just as often these notes are fabricated as legal proof

95
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Of their insan

96
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,351
Separating The Pretender from the genuine article is the art of the criminal psychologist

97
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
I believe you me this is no easy task the introverted shifty-eyed serial killer is more or less a Hollywood fabrication

98
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Many killers are highly intelligent intuitive and extremely Charming they are

99
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
Adoptive and skillful Liars

100
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,039
So that's it

101
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439
You think he might be toying with me well let's not add to the mounting pile of conjecture just yet

102
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,023
Why don't you tell me a little bit more about this Johan

103
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,607
My wife and I got divorced about 3 years ago

104
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:09,471
What I mean to say is my wife divorced Me 3 years ago

105
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Thank you rud

106
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
I need to do some research give me a call next week

107
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
Do you have an opinion about this person

108
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
Seems like my kind of guy

109
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
Can you elaborate on that

110
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
The monster

111
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
I get all that

112
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
That's interesting

113
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
You

114
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
The monster

115
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
Makes sense of course

116
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
There's a monster inside both of you

117
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
To be fair there's even a monster inside of me

118
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Shut your mouth

119
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,151
That's nothing but textbook garbage

120
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
Why is that

121
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
What I'm telling you doctor is at a real monster does exist

122
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
What do you think you're doing just stop looking at me like that

123
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
Don't you dare look at me

124
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
What are you doing

125
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:22,431
I'm feeling the guards

126
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
Are you scared

127
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
Because there are things out there that would turn your blood to ice

128
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:41,631
I'm going to tell you a secret thank you for your Cooper

129
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Operation

130
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,239
You really still convinced that Tim was going to try and contact you again

131
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
I'm sure of it

132
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,103
And when he does he'll notify you immediately

133
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
However

134
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
Well go on

135
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,319
After his arrest I would like to get permission to use him and his case in my research

136
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
Doctor Turner would make a compelling subject

137
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,951
He has a complex Criminal Mind

138
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
I'm going to tell you a secret go to Miss Hannah Kim

139
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:27,199
Towson group house make your way to the basement you're going to find all of your answers down there

140
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:37,439
Down there you'll find proof proof the monster

141
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
Really does exist

142
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
This is Rudy

143
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Cinema

144
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,495
I've been waiting for your call

145
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
Yeah all right

146
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
Excellent I'll see you there

147
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,759
Officer call Tim I just called we've arranged for a meeting tonight

148
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
Odell Park tonight at 8:00

149
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
By the fountain that's right

150
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Goodbye then

151
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,655
I'm currently retracing Jurgen steps on the day of his 12th confessed murder

152
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
According to our interviews he broke into the basement

153
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
And stayed hidden there for several hours

154
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,615
Later when Mrs Kemp returned home

155
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,455
He made his way into the upstairs bedroom and murdered her there

156
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
There's nothing out of the ordinary

157
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Except

158
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,463
There are framed photos

159
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
All over the basement

160
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
Their own pictures of Mrs Kem

161
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
Just a doll

162
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
Almost gave me a heart attack

163
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:06,015
Evidence of this so-called monster Jurgen sent me to find clearly isn't here

164
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,879
The supports my theory that Jurgens committed the 12th murder to confuse investigators

165
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,231
His first explanation was that he committed the murder as a favor for a friend

166
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,303
One he Associates with a primal monster archetyp

167
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,623
When I was a kid

168
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
What she would do

169
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
It was dark

170
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
She had this big dog

171
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,647
Where

172
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:24,607
What does it mean exact in every detail

173
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:31,007
Is it possible did Jergens actually recreate the basement from his childhood

174
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
Boy next to Mrs Kemp is

175
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:50,207
Perkins it can't be there's no evidence connecting young Jurgens to Mrs Kemp

176
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:56,607
Something is not right here

177
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
This one

178
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
This one and another all of these Mrs Kemp never

179
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
So who is this boy

180
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583
Who are you down there you'll find proof proof the monster really

181
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
Does exist

182
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,751
I followed all of the instructions and my friend left me in the letter perfectly

183
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,823
Just listen

184
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,687
The first letter came in a blank envelope without a name or return address

185
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
He understood me

186
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
Sympathize with me crap like that

187
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
I was annoyed

188
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Angry at first

189
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
But then another one came

190
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
And then another the next day

191
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
And again and so on

192
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,839
He's a letter freak

193
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,191
But before I knew it I started to expect the letters

194
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
Even enjoy them a bit

195
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Then I thought

196
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,895
Maybe it's possible he might actually be a friend to me

197
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,735
And then one day one of his letters asked me for something

198
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,319
He asked me to go down to the basement of this house

199
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,135
And did the basement belong to Mrs Kemp

200
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,047
I still don't know how he could have known

201
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,191
There's no way he could possibly have known what happened to me down there when I was a kid

202
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,543
Somehow he got everything right down to the smallest detail

203
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
How do you do that

204
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
I just got so confused

205
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,343
The next thing I knew I was upstairs and Mrs Camp was dead

206
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,743
He's a letter freak as well

207
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,943
What is this another

208
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,295
And this another one

209
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
Look at me

210
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
Look at me

211
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,695
Let's try inside me is getting bigger

212
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:36,095
Help me the monster inside of me is about to explode

213
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
These are the messages that Johan left me

214
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
They're the same

215
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,967
Jergens's friend and your hot he's real

216
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,743
Anything yet it's way past eight already

217
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Inspector call

218
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Target in sight

219
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Asian male

220
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Long hair

221
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,015
I appreciate you making time for this Rudy

222
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,855
I want you to know I did research what you gave me

223
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
But I thought you were making it up

224
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,047
I thought that Johan was just a ruse a scapegoat you created to buy you time once you were caught

225
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
You've got to believe me

226
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Rudy

227
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:47,263
I've been conducting research on a serial killer named Jurgens and something he said caught my attention

228
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,615
One of his victims is off pattern showing no connection to profile or ritual

229
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,271
It doesn't matter Rudy please just listen to me okay listen up everyone will finish for today

230
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,343
We'll see you tomorrow seems like the carnival is wrapping up

231
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Everyone in position

232
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,951
Make sure they're ready to move in on my mark

233
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Yes sir

234
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,535
I want every detail of their conversation

235
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
You hated me didn't you

236
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,727
You've hated me ever since you caught me cheating on that exam in college

237
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
I could feel your disdain

238
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
Go ahead say it

239
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
Inspector call

240
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
This doesn't look good

241
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
Dr Gillian and Tenma are headed toward the west exit

242
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,111
Damn we'll lose them and that crowd that's leaving

243
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
You'll be well within your right

244
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:41,791
A man like me doesn't deserve your respect Rudy this isn't the time to remin listen to me

245
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,887
Now then I looked up the answers and wrote them all down on a cheat sheet

246
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,191
She just like this one

247
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,543
Run we're surrounded by the police

248
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,127
Don't look just walk

249
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Is Doctor timer threatening Gillen

250
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,831
I'm not sure sir there's too much background noise for me to hear

251
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
Jurgen's recently confessed to me that he had killed Mrs Kemp at the request of a friend

252
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
Booty what is this

253
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,143
Something I found in Mrs Kemp's basement

254
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,495
But Mrs Kemp never had any children

255
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:29,151
I have found compelling evidence to suggest that jurgens' friend and your Johan are both

256
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Same

257
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:35,807
They've passed through the West exit should we move in tell everyone

258
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:41,439
I found a letter from Johann and Mrs Kemp's house it was almost identical to the one you brought me

259
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,839
I believe that Johan had been in the care of Mrs Kemp at some point in his life that would explain

260
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
Motivation for orchestrating her death you're an innocent man

261
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,639
I'm sorry I can't give you as much detail as perhaps you'd like but here's what I've worked out on

262
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
Johan so far

263
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,783
I don't know how he does it but Johan can somehow identify other killers

264
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,135
He finds them worms his way in beguiles them then manipulates them

265
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:18,559
It is worth noting that to the best of our knowledge he hasn't killed the foster parents who cared for him as a

266
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
Probably because by the time he reached that age he no longer found himself dependent on anyone perhaps

267
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
But I have another theory

268
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,359
What if Yohan found himself his ideal family

269
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
And then became a part of it

270
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,735
But my work so hard to erase his past

271
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
Was there an ulterior motive

272
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,647
If that is indeed the case did he make his way into the family for a specific

273
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
Purpose

274
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,975
And what would that purpose be

275
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Well

276
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
We're at the bus terminal

277
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,215
Yes confirm which bus Tim is getting on

278
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,359
They get a car over to the terminal and have him follow yes sir

279
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
At least I can do is buy you a bus ticket

280
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
You know

281
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,319
There's still time for you to turn yourself in and prove your innocence

282
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
I promise I can help you

283
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
The truth is I'm not chasing after your hunt just so I can prove my innocence

284
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,584
Thank you for all your help Rudy

285
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:30,240
You don't have to become him to end this that reminds me

286
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,312
I really didn't despise you back in college Rudy

287
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:39,968
I mean it I thought you were brilliant and it was a shame we never had a chance to talk I'm glad that I

288
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:46,368
I'm finally count you as a friend but I know you caught me cheating on that medical logs and there's no doubt about it

289
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
I saw you looking directly at me and my cheat sheet oh yeah cheated on the medical

290
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:59,168
Typical exam too

291
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,968
Be careful timma

292
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:43,712
What did that sign back that say I missed it

293
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:50,112
I've been trying to figure out this map is it this way or that way I'm not quite sure

294
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:56,512
Sure we're headed in the right direction really where did you find that map lying in the street

295
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:02,912
You know me better than that you were right beside me when I picked it up at the car rental place

296
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,312
You picking anything up you must have grabbed it when I went up to use the facilities

297
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,712
Names with such small print at my age it's almost impossible to read your glasses at the

298
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:22,112
Is weapon housing and amputs housing and he's got two

299
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:28,512
That's quite a mouthful dad he's German names all sound like don't they they are

300
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,912
Using I wonder if Germans think that about our towns when they read British Maps

301
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:41,312
Now we need to know when the next Crossroads coming up

302
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:47,712
There's a pedestrian let's ask him for directions

303
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,296
Ourselves

304
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,696
Let's give him a ride if you ask me we're looking for trouble giving a ride to complete stranger

305
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
Maybe so oh wait a minute he's traveling with a small child

306
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,240
I feel sorry for them let's pick them up all right fine

307
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,480
Hey look 10 of those people just stopped for us

308
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,648
Couldn't talk better

309
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,232
Sorry we don't speak German

310
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
Do you understand me

311
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
Oh are you both from England

312
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,400
We're trying to get to freiheim and would really appreciate your help

313
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
Could I see that map

314
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:46,336
So where is this place the place you're traveling to

315
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,152
Oh well all right

316
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:55,552
We're around this area now so it's just a bit further south from here

317
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,416
I suppose

318
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,816
Duncan

319
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:13,216
You're quite an Odd Couple on you

320
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:19,616
I mean I don't believe you're his father you appear to be Asian and the boy

321
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:26,016
Clearly German Caucasian yes in fact he's my best friend's son and

322
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:32,416
Some sort of well-educated professional man it's the way

323
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:45,216
I must apologize for him sorry it's not personal he just enjo

324
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:51,616
Is observing people now that he's retired from the police force

325
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:58,016
Nothing she just said that he used to be a cop

326
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:04,416
Let's get out of here 10 months easy so

327
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:10,816
I've been thinking I'll bet this is the first real vacation the two of you have taken since your husband retired

328
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:17,216
Yes you're right my husband was such a workaholic I never truly believe we'd be able to take a big

329
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:23,616
Put together but here we both are so I'm sorry we're imposing on this time you plan to spend with your wife

330
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,016
We'd be happy to catch another ride if we're being a nuisance here sorry the biggest nuisance has been

331
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:36,416
Getting lost cuz we can't read directions not to mention the trouble we've been having ordering food it might help

332
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:42,816
You traveling with us if I need to interpret the bloody language

333
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
Well what should we do now de

334
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
There's nothing we can do I'm afraid

335
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,992
Except find a gas station and bring some back

336
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
Look here comes the truck

337
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,880
Hey stop hey over here

338
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,720
What's wrong

339
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,536
We're out of gas

340
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,120
That's kind of a problem out here in the middle of No Man's Land huh

341
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,240
Well I've got room for two of you in my cab

342
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,872
Is that okay somebody should take the trip up on his offer

343
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,736
Don't worry about us we'll be all right we'll work something out

344
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:15,232
Listen as soon as I see a gas station I'll get them to send somebody out here with a can of gas for you

345
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,816
Thank you that would be most helpful and we really appreciate it

346
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:39,040
This is great thank goodness right then everything worked out perfectly

347
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:58,240
How long do you think it will be before we come to a gas station

348
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:04,640
Don't remember there being any around

349
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
He's been quite a while now

350
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
Indeed it has my dear

351
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,032
With that nice young man let them know that we're stranded out here on the motorway

352
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,872
The petrol station will send someone out won't they

353
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
There is another possibility

354
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,272
He might just have left us and forgotten about us

355
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
I don't believe it

356
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
He's not that kind of person

357
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,672
He struck me as a very caring man

358
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
Maybe not

359
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,592
What a beautiful scar

360
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,176
I'm not really in the mood to enjoy a sunset tonight

361
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,968
See one you've seen them all

362
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,832
I will not talking about the sunset

363
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,136
The sun's already disappeared

364
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,976
But just look at the lovely pastel colors the sun has left behind

365
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,048
It's like a watercolor painting in the sky

366
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,912
I wonder if Roberts watching it now

367
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
We be seeing it together

368
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,824
My goodness

369
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,224
I think it is do you better take a look my ass might be deceiving me

370
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,552
Someone's coming this way

371
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:55,232
It's getting bright and closer

372
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:01,888
It must be him I just knew it

373
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:08,288
Couldn't find

374
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
Gas station

375
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,640
I borrowed the gas and a lamp from a farmer

376
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:17,504
See I told you

377
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,240
Oh that was a delicious meal wasn't it dear

378
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,688
Thanks to your excellent translation of the German menu we were actually able to order something we could enjoy tonight

379
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
Especially that one

380
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,088
Oh it was forcedur

381
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,904
It's from the palatnet region

382
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,720
That liver dish was just scrumptious

383
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
The liver canoodle

384
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,536
That Cyrus pronounced

385
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,352
Melted in my mouth

386
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,240
If you hadn't been with us we had passed all these wonderful places without a clue as to what we were missing

387
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,080
I want to thank you for treating us to dinner

388
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
You're almost finished

389
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,920
Would you like some more to take with you

390
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,248
Thanks but if he has any more he'll burst

391
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,064
Do you think this plug looks like a criminal

392
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:03,232
For this chapter these are the trial for murdering his wife and there's a big picture of him in the paper see for yourself

393
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
What's your opinion

394
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,816
Do you think you did

395
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
Well who can tell really before I retired from the full so I was a detective with

396
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,288
Watch a long list of criminals that I put on

397
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,944
Oh come on dear we're enjoying the evening it's really not appropriate to brag about all your past exploits

398
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
Well

399
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,808
I would look at a person's face and I'd know if he'd done the crime

400
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,416
I possessed an uncanny neck for spotting the guilt that a person tries to hide

401
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
I see

402
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,512
Let's talk about something else now de

403
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,816
I think you've had a little too much wine

404
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
However

405
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,424
After years on the job I couldn't tell anymore

406
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,080
Was one person good and another bad

407
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
Was he guilty or innoc

408
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,712
I couldn't Spot the Difference that it won't seem so clear

409
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,832
I probably means I wasn't such a hot shot detective after all

410
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Enough said

411
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,072
Maybe I did have a little too much to drink

412
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
Tell me once more

413
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
What was the name of that wine

414
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
It was fosterone

415
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,312
Excellent bouquet

416
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,504
How cute they each

417
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
A friend

418
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:08,160
When this trip is over Dieter and you move to a new place I hope you make lots of friends

419
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,464
Oh

420
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
Sure that'd be great

421
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
Everyone should have a happy childhood

422
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,864
They should enjoy every minute

423
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
It goes by so fast

424
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:23,776
Yes

425
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Sorry

426
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,112
Should be somewhere right around here what are you looking for

427
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
Is the address dear

428
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,512
Almost there

429
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,608
Sorry but we have to make a stop before continuing that's fine

430
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
Oh here we are

431
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
The police

432
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,728
We won't be very dumb if you don't mind

433
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,312
Might as well wait in the car

434
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,152
What should we do tema

435
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,720
Let's run away

436
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:18,720
What's wrong someone's parked in one of the officers only spaces again he looks foreign guess I should

437
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:23,584
Nah don't worry about it

438
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,752
What are we going to do

439
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,992
Mr Jones we want to get to freiheim

440
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:19,392
I don't know if you're aware of it but you're heading in the opposite direction

441
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:25,792
It's a brief teacher I want to stop at Steinbach castle for a bit but dear

442
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:32,192
Stand by Castle or something I want to see for myself

443
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,536
How are you doing are you all right

444
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
Oh thank you

445
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,248
My son wrote us a letter about Steinbeck

446
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,600
He said the view from this Castle is truly breathtaking

447
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,416
He wanted to bring us here so we could both see it

448
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,232
Oh does your son live in Germany now

449
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,560
We're on our way to see

450
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,888
It's just that we have a few details to make along the way

451
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,784
This is the view he sold on that fightful day

452
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
My

453
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
My

454
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,376
I am flashing blood killed a

455
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,728
We came to this country to visit him because he'll never leave

456
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
Well we'll be okay from here

457
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,416
Thank you so much for everything thank you

458
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,256
For your kindness and the pleasure of your company

459
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,536
Chariot

460
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,584
Look after yourself

461
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:42,240
Such a nice young

462
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,640
Yes isn't he it's hard to believe that he's wanted is the Prime Suspect

463
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:55,040
A series of murders you must be mistaken no I'm

464
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:01,440
Not it's him he's on The Wanted suspects list I'm afraid so and when

465
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:07,840
You're at the station to speak to the detective arrested Robert 10 was photo was prominently posted on the wall

466
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,376
Unbelievable

467
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
There's so much good in him

468
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
I know

469
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,104
I thought so too and yet everyone seems convinced that he's guilty but my instincts keep

470
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Telling me

471
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,432
He's an innocent man

472
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:29,088
A good amount why is the bad I'm sure of it

473
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:35,488
It was unbelievable to think the rubber that committed murder but he

474
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:41,888
And the fact that I couldn't sense what was going on with my own son made me realize it was time for me to turn in my bad

475
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:51,872
But you know something dear I just want to be able to trust my instincts again

476
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:58,271
Robert may have committed to try and true but I know he's a good boy at heart

477
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:04,671
Come on let's go in and see our son

478
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:11,071
Oh dear Robert
