7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,856
Leaving B Barbara

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,648
Mom wasn't built in a day you know

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,256
It's the same deal with my new antique business rough start then smooth sailing

10
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,352
Well for me everything is really happened so quickly

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,424
I suddenly get to live in this gorgeous house

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,496
And I have a wonderful and caring husband

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,544
Who makes me great cocktails

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
Hey honey

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
Did you see something just then

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
There in the window

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,880
I get this feeling sometimes

18
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,928
Like we're being watched

19
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,744
What honey that house has been empty for a while

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
Yeah I know

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
It's OD

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
Actually

23
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,656
I talked to Mrs Daughtry from across the street

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
What about

25
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
She said

26
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
The 20 years ago

27
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,312
A couple was brutally murdered in that house

28
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,664
Anyone who moves in never stays for long they say the place is haunted

29
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,528
Michael dear what's the matter

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,648
Wait a minute now don't tell me that you believe in ghosts too do you darling

31
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,976
Of course not what do you take me for

32
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
Are you going out sir

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Yeah

34
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
I'll get the car

35
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
Not this time

36
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,240
I thought it might be a nice change of pace to go out just the three of us

37
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
Don't worry no one's going to try anything

38
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
I get it

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,664
Unless I'm mistaken you're wanting a little father son time with the boy

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
You're a smart Buddy Guy you know that

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Best of luck to you Daddy

42
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
Have a good time

43
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
All right off we go

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
So Detective

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Why don't you dig up

46
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
Regarding Dr Tenma

47
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,768
Everything checked out exactly as you told me

48
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:50,144
He's the main suspect in the murder of the Fortuner couple but the police have no idea where he is at the moment

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Here's a transcript of 10 statement

50
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
He made it back during that first questioning

51
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,872
He operated on a boy at Eisler Memorial Hospital 10 years ago

52
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
Saved his life

53
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,224
Kid went on to kill the hospital director and two other doctors

54
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
The boy's name was Johan

55
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,672
He was already a young man the next time 10 men encountered him turns out Johann executed a patient in his care

56
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,768
Next up Nina Fortuner

57
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
She was the murdered couples foster daughter

58
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
No one seen her since the night they were killed either

59
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
Messner was a tougher nut to crack

60
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
But I did finally track him down in Frankfurt

61
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Well

62
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
What did you find

63
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
The grave with his name on it

64
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,247
Turns out he was stabbed to death about 2 months ago

65
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,855
The official police version is that he was on the wrong side of a drug deal gone bad

66
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Back when I was a detective on the

67
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,999
Force Messner was my partner

68
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
Sorry for your Los

69
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,935
They caught Messner with confiscated narcotics and booted him off the force

70
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
After that he got some help from a man called the baby

71
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Bring any bells

72
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,615
He's the spokesman for some nationalist group in Frank

73
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
How is this relevant

74
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:10,527
You remember hearing those news reports about how it's Turkish quarter almost burned down last winter right

75
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599
Word on the street is the whole thing was the babies brainchild

76
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,439
And the Turks credit an Asian stranger with having saved their neighborhood

77
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,023
Turns out that stranger's name was Tenma

78
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
What are the odds

79
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
I'm thinking it was the doctor

80
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,751
And what's more people are saying the baby had those fires set to commemorate the introduction of a new leader into their

81
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,359
Some Wonder can they were all really excited about he was going to change everything

82
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Who is this guy

83
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
I've already told you

84
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
What was the name of that boy Dr Tana saved a decade ago

85
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Johan

86
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:52,255
Well that young man who was supposed to take the reins of the babies organization in Frankfort

87
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:59,167
He was your hun too

88
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
You should have seen that one coming

89
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Call me crazy Robert

90
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
But I feel like one of the ponds on this chess

91
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Waiting for the

92
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
Goodness

93
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,935
What's going you looking so pensive all of a sudden thinking about the past

94
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
Everything was going straight to hell for me at the time

95
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,335
But after that phone call it change was like night and day

96
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,687
Back then my partner Messner and I were selling drugs

97
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,503
Whatever we confiscated off of the dealers we busted

98
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
The voice in the other end knew everything

99
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
He said it would be our little secret

100
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,999
If we did him a favor kill some couple in Heidelberg

101
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
The fortuners

102
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
And I didn't know him from Adam

103
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
But there was another guy there that night a newspaper reporter or

104
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
We killed all three of them

105
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
No choice

106
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
After that somebody wired money to the both of us when I left the police force The Syndicate was waiting

107
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
With a great offer

108
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,391
They gave me a plum job and the pay was top-notch

109
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
I had everything I wanted out of life or so I thought that's when you met your wife and decided to go straight or

110
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:07,423
So I would wager yeah but I still can't figure out why they let me just walk away

111
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Who was it

112
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
Who called me that day

113
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:17,151
I got to know who transferred all that money over to us who the hell is manipulating my life oh

114
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
Damn it

115
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Robert

116
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
I want to be sure that you know

117
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
I really appreciate your help

118
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Well if that's how you feel

119
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695

120
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887

125
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,015

Bye-bye Daddy

129
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
Roberto

130
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Were there any calls from the detective

131
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
He should have come by now

132
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967

00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559

I was watching from next door

138
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
Your bodyguard's the one who killed him

139
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735

You murdered him

143
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
You came here for revenge and he got in the way right

144
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
Damn you

145
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047

00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,399
Said if we didn't kill your folks like he asked he was going to tell the cops about the drugs we were selling

156
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
On the side don't you get it we had to do it we didn't

157
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,199
Have any other choice

158
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,783
You didn't have any other choice

159
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Stop the car

160
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,511
Stop the car God damn it

161
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,863
My parents were wonderful people

162
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
The kindest couple I'll ever know

163
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
Mom and dad love me

164
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
You love me with all their heart and soul

165
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,503
Please don't do this it didn't even matter to them that I wasn't there real daughter

166
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
They love me all the same

167
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
My mom and dad were angels

168
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,535
They were Angels I'm sorry please don't shoot Angel and

169
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,935
Like you

170
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Barbara

171
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,007
You're crying for your family

172
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
What about mine

173
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,455
So this is what it feels like

174
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
Right before somebody kills you

175
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Fritz

176
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
He called me Daddy today

177
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:54,047
For the first time don't take that from me please please let me live

178
00:13:54,303 --> 00:14:00,447
I finally found someone worth living for Barbara

179
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
Impressed

180
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
I met them at half past 8:00 in the morning

181
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
At a cafe in Dussel

182
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,199
I quit the force and joined the syndicate

183
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,271
My boss told me to act like a businessman

184
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
Made for a nice cover

185
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,415
Every morning this woman and her little boy would walk by

186
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
They were my daily reminder

187
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
The regular

188
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
Honest life I've given up

189
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
Hey so how you doing

190
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
I'm fine thanks for asking

191
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
Tell me something what did you hire that detective for

192
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,151
I was hoping he could find you in 10

193
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
And my former partner

194
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
I wanted to know what he was up to

195
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
Messenger's dead

196
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
Whatever it's worth

197
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Stabbed to death

198
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,951
When I heard about that I asked the detective to find out more information

199
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
Last night I got a phone call from him

200
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
I've been digging around

201
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
It's strange what do you mean strange

202
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,503
From Dusseldorf I'll give you all the details when I see you in person

203
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
Here it is

204
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
The draft of the report

205
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Messner's killer

206
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Robert

207
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Look at this

208
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
Do you know what this means

209
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Yes hello

210
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Hey boss

211
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
I need that bag

212
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Roberto

213
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Your

214
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
Some Fritz are already home

215
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
What are you saying

216
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,623
If you hurt them I might be hurrying right back

217
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
A lot of accidents happen at home

218
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Give me a gun

219
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
Look there's something I got

220
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Remember

221
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
That model is intended for close range work

222
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,087
Only got four shots so make them count don't worry about me

223
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,159
I was an officer Once Upon a Time

224
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,023
Can have me dying before you take me to the police and have me confess to killing your parents

225
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,607
That's right so don't even think of dying on me

226
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
I'll cover you from the empty house next door good luck

227
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,879
Hi Daddy

228
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
I had to go fishing with his daddy

229
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,887
Barbara thank God

230
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
Where's your bear now

231
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
Oh that reminds me

232
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
The gentleman from his security team are here

233
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
He said something happened while we were out

234
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
Team

235
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,503
There's no need to worry he said everything's fine and no one was hurt

236
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,367
Oh Roberto look Michaels come home

237
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Everything's all right

238
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
It was nothing important just a broken window

239
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,023
Probably just a kid from the neighborhood

240
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
Nothing to worry about

241
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Nothing at all

242
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,919
Where's the body what have you done with him damn it a body what are you

243
00:17:54,175 --> 00:18:00,319

257
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,895

How about tomorrow

262
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
It's over

263
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,607
I don't see ghosts anymore

264
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,639
You have very nice eyes

265
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,503
You're definitely Johan sister

266
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,343
I let you take me in without a fight because you promised I'd get to see him

267
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
I did indeed

268
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
He's really looking forward to catching up with you right now if you must know he's living Happ

269
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Probably in Munich

270
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,983
You know you really have very nice eyes Such a Pity I just

271
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:32,383
Bring myself to do it

272
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,783
What's next

273
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,183
Ah yes Dr Tina

274
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
But why

275
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Why did you come

276
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
It's like I told you

277
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
For Better or For Worse

278
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
I did used to be a cop

279
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,808
Don't worry you're almost home I know

280
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:50,208
I told Fritz that we'd go fishing tomorrow I promised

281
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:56,608
Good I hope it's sunny

282
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
I'm sure

283
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
It will

284
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:25,792
Excuse me sir sir just a couple of questions please stay there stay right there

285
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:32,192
Interfering with a crime scene can you please tell us what the police are thinking what are your views on this situation

286
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:44,992
No matter how you look at it it's obvious this incident is exactly like the other cases of murdered middle-aged couples across Germany

287
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,296
No comment at this time

288
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,880
I've heard that the bka is sending an agent to look into this is that true

289
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,952
Does that mean there's a connection to the serial murders

290
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,256
No comment oh man

291
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,912
I think I have better luck talking to a bka suit directly than trying to get this guy to give me anything

292
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,472
Just trust me all right

293
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:11,104
I promise you will be the first ones with the story just make sure you leave plenty of space on the front page

294
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
Just dude I got to go

295
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
Excuse me sir

296
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,832
My name is Kipper I'm with the Hamburg dog

297
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,952
You've been sent here by the bka to investigate this murder

298
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
Correct me if I'm wrong

299
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
I was wondering

300
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:33,632
Is this case somehow connected to the others here real murders well Kipper of the Hamburg to

301
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
You're right on both counts

302
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,472
Get your pen ready

303
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
Because here's my statement

304
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,896
A middle-aged couple was murdered and it appears to be another serial slaying

305
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
I knew it

306
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,224
And it's a suspect that Japanese doctor

307
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
Yes I just saw the report

308
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,832
It's his Mo the murders were carried out the same way

309
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
Thank you for the sco

310
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,208
Got to run oh one more thing

311
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm aware the Hamburg talk is a leading local newspaper

312
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,680
But I expect you to make sure your story gets published in every major newspaper in the country as well

313
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,264
Hey consider it done thanks again for all your help friend

314
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
I have become the Killer

315
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
I think to myself as I approach

316
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,024
What's the best way to get into their house

317
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
Should I knock

318
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,144
I don't want to startle the Yoke pays by walking in on them

319
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
Such a friendly

320
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
They greet me

321
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,152
And show me to the living room

322
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:56,576
These folks aren't the least bit suspicious as they Lead Me In

323
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:05,280
The husband's chair naturally I sit on the sofa facing him

324
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
A few minutes later the husband will die on the floor

325
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,264
There but I haven't made that movie yet

326
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,592
So I have to decide when to eliminate him

327
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,992
I'll do it when the wife leaves a room where did she go to the kitchen to

328
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:31,392
Tea she is stabbed in the back before she even has a chance to serve it obviously

329
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:37,792
Play that I need to make my move on the husband while she's occupied in the kitchen I reach in pull out

330
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:44,192
The knife the husband sees this panics tries to stand up by stab him but I miss and end up

331
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,592
The husband runs off with blood dripping from his wounded left hand so I try to get him again

332
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:56,992
Swing the night this time I only puncture his right shoulder I'm such a clumsy amateur desperately the

333
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:03,392
Husband yells his wife's name only she can't hear him from out in the kitchen recently she's developed a

334
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:09,792
Turns out I knew about that didn't I go on shout all you want I

335
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:16,192
My time to kill you and then your wife you're trapped there's your left handprint on the wall

336
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:22,592
You can't get away from me I've got you pinned against this table you're finished

337
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
But then

338
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,968
Something prevents me from completing the task

339
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,064
5 m from this point where the husband dies

340
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,160
How come why not just eliminate them here and be done with it

341
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
My weight

342
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,192
I've never seen him

343
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,520
Murdered my neighbors

344
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:58,176
For the moment I can only say he's a person of interest but I'm asking everybody in the neighborhood for their cooperation in this

345
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,528
If you see this man just act normal I don't want him to become suspicious

346
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,344
Then get in touch with me as soon as you possibly can

347
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
That would be all I need for you to do

348
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,000
I personally assure you you won't be in any danger

349
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,168
Hard to imagine such a tragic event like this happening here it's such a pleasant quiet neighborhood

350
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,704
It really is

351
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,776
Any old pays for such nice people just the best

352
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:28,896
When I call out to her from my doorstep Mrs yopay would always greet me cheerfully

353
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,688
That's very interesting

354
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,064
I've been told Mrs yopé lost her hearing about a year ago and refused to hearing aid

355
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
Huh are you sure

356
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
It was in her medical record

357
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
If I had to guess

358
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,512
She really couldn't hear any of your greetings

359
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,680
Well knowing the type of person she was she probably sensed my presence and wanted to make me feel good

360
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:56,544
So then in your opinion nobody else in the neighborhood knew about her hearing loss either

361
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,616
No I wouldn't think so

362
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,200
It certainly appears that your business is booming

363
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
You made rapid progress at an early age

364
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,344
It's not easy for a young man to achieve such quick success Mr

365
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
You're right

366
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,208
The contracts I made with the car manufacturers just happened to work out

367
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:21,376
Before we begin I'd like to extend my deepest condolences for the recent loss of your aunt and uncle

368
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Thank you

369
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,496
They're passing was a great loss they were the only relatives I had left in the world

370
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,824
It appears they never had any children of Their Own

371
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,152
So they must have taken good care of you since you were there only nephew

372
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
Yes

373
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
They treated me as if I were their son

374
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,040
Sir tell me you'll be able to catch the murderer

375
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:45,696
I will I'm pretty sure I know who's behind it me too I bet it was that Japanese doctor wasn't it sounds like

376
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
Very well informed

377
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
Well of course I am

378
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,328
As a matter of fact I've heard he's been linked to other murders similar to this

379
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,376
I'm curious

380
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
Just how much do you stand to inherit

381
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
You see

382
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,056
I found out that Mr yopay was quite a wealthy man

383
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
So what

384
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,896
His wealth has nothing to do with the serial murder case

385
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,504
Sir I presume you are the sole heir to their considerable estate

386
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,064
Seeing as how you are they're only nephew

387
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,184
It's inappropriate to be discussing my inheritance in these circumstances

388
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:23,840
A company can appear to be booming on the surface but underneath may have serious cash flow problems that have gotten out

389
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,656
Of hand it's a common occurrence in the business world

390
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:32,544
Just a minute you're implying I murdered them when there's a serial killer on the loose how dare you

391
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:37,152
What are you so worried about you have a perfect Alibi for the time in question

392
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:43,808
And you have plenty of witnesses you bought your secretary and some others a nice dinner after a long meeting

393
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,392
What exactly are you getting at

394
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,464
That it appears that you could not be the murderer

395
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
I'm sure you agree

396
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,120
Inspector Lungi well

397
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,936
What do you want Kipper what the hell is going on

398
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,472
Going on with what

399
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,520
Don't play dumb inspector

400
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,848
I've been out digging up stuff on that nephew for the last couple days

401
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,504
His company looks profitable at first glance but turns out to be holding a lot of bad stocks and bonds Cash Wise it's in the world of hurt

402
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
And now

403
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,600
I found out you've been investigating the same company

404
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
I want the truth

405
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,928
Who killed those folks Looney

406
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:26,816
In light of what you've uncovered do you still think this case is related to the other middle-aged murders

407
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:33,216
All of the newspapers have printed A variation of my story if the cases aren't related then it's just Sensational journalism

408
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,264
My reputation could be damaged

409
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,824
Your instincts are correct

410
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,200
It's the work of a copycat it was set up to look like the serial killer

411
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:49,600
That's just great I've got to publish retraction right away no it's fine as it is

412
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:56,000
Huh you'll continue writing your follow-up stories as if this case where another one of the middle-aged couple murders

413
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
It's not ethical no way I won't do it I tell you oh but you will I'm an honest journalist who believes

414
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:08,800
Reporting the whole truth and you're not going to tell me what I can write well let me give you the truth we have good tast

415
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:15,200
Really she's quite lovely you have a pleasant home with a devoted wife

416
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:21,600
Daughter who both adore you but it was impossible for you to resist the charms of that attractive other

417
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,672
Wasn't it

418
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,072
Continuous before no beef it up a little

419
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:37,472
Write a special report about the serial murders if you do as I've asked

420
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:44,128
He'll most certainly come I'm counting on you

421
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Yes who is it

422
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,696
Excuse me ma'am may I ask you some questions

423
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Well

424
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,304
Sounds like the your pace we're really a wonderful couple

425
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
They were

426
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
I see

427
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,704
And you're absolutely certain they didn't have any adopted children

428
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:13,824
Did any children children that you never seen before live with them even for a short time

429
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
No never

430
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,944
But they took very good care of their nephew he was the apple of their eye

431
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,528
Would you like more tea it won't take a minute

432
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
I'm fine

433
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,880
A little more tea won't hurt you

434
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
There's no mistaking

435
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
Nothing to worry about

436
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
Thanks for your cooperation

437
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,640
Inspect a long day someone's here to see you

438
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
Well who is it

439
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,224
He says he's the nephew of the L

440
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
That couple that was killed

441
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,344
Inspector you believe I'm the one who murdered them

442
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
I'm your suspect right

443
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
You think I killed my aunt and uncle for their money

444
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,768
That's what you hinted at the other day

445
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,608
Let's face it we both know that I have many debts right now

446
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:13,472
And the inheritance money they ended up leaving me will more than likely get me out of this whole mess

447
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,544
However that's not the kind of person I am

448
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,384
Is that really all you came here to tell me

449
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
All I came here

450
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,016
Wait a minute how dare you speak to me in such a condescending way

451
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,136
Well if you'll excuse me there's somewhere I have to be right at the moment

452
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:36,000
Don't you walk away I demand an apology for your disrespectful Behavior

453
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:41,376
Perhaps you weren't aware that the police had been following you well now that order has been canceled

454
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,240
Your local law enforcement thinks that you're innocent

455
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:52,640
Isn't that good enough for you Mr geebel

456
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
You want to know if I think you are guilty

457
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,272
That really doesn't matter to me at the moment

458
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,904
My chief concern is to catch the man I've been after

459
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,680
The blood stain over there can only mean one thing

460
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:22,080
He must have missed then am I to assume that you're convinced the

461
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:28,480
Never assume anything I've concluded it

462
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:34,880
Copycat murder made to look like the middle-aged couples homicides but how can you be so certain about that

463
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:41,280
Because there's one element this case has it makes it different from all the others

464
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:47,680
The killer Corner the victim here but he doesn't finish him off

465
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:54,080
He waits till his victim gets over there before delivering the final blow but why why

466
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
It's not him

467
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
That element

468
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
Is emotion

469
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
Emotion

470
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:12,000
Yes you see the man I'm after always take small valuables

471
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,816
He tries to make his crimes look like robberies

472
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,632
He murders quickly without hesitation or emotion

473
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
At least that's his goal

474
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:26,592
But this crime scene is full of emotions the killer panicked when he saw his face

475
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,408
Victims face together in the mirror

476
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,944
You needn't worry

477
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,528
From what I've observed the police in this town are totally incompet

478
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,464
This crime was definitely not committed by Johann

479
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,024
But somebody wants the police

480
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Depended on him

481
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,120
How much longer is this all going to continue

482
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
When will it end

483
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,784
Hello it's been a while

484
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,624
So we finally meet again doctor Tenma

485
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,000
I've been looking all over for you

486
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:22,656
For a very long time I've been hoping to have a quiet chat with you

487
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:29,056
There's no use in

488
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,456
Away anymore stop trying to escape and talk to me period that is

489
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:41,856
No place you can hide Dr Tenna

490
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,256
Yes you're all mine

491
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:01,056
That's so hard couldn't you just leave it alone

492
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:20,256
Profession

493
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:26,656
Nothing to me just stay out of my way

494
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:33,056
Come on

495
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
He's been seriously wounded

496
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,816
I've got to do something now or he's going to bleed to death

497
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:01,472
Who could have stop

498
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:07,872
I'll drop him off in front of the hospital and get away

499
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
How are

500
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,608
I need the keys to the handcuffs tell me where you put them inspector

501
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
Don't bother reaching for your gun

502
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,472
I took it off you while you were unconscious

503
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,336
Don't be so stubborn just give me the keys I'm a doctor but I can't help you like this

504
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,896
How you examined your wound the best I could

505
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,456
It appears that only your muscles sustain the damage

506
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,320
But you're losing an awful lot of blood if we don't stop the bleeding you're going to die

507
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
Come on confess

508
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
Do it Dr Tim

509
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Best to what

510
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:04,704
That you murdered the director of Isler Memorial Hospital along with three others

511
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:09,056
And that you've been on a 3-year Killing Spree targeting middle-aged couples

512
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,128
It's time to come clean and admit what

513
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Done

514
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,456
If you keep this up you'll be a Deadman

515
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
Come on

516
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
Don't try to fool me

517
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,624
You're only fooling yourself by running around chasing this elusive Johan

518
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
Johan doesn't exist

519
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
Admit it you made him up

520
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,256
You're a Yohan

521
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,560
Own up to it

522
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:38,240
Inspector right now you require emergency treatment I have everything I need to do the procedure

523
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:43,616
Except for my hands and I can't save your life when I'm chained together yes

524
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,664
When you're the

525
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,784
Dr Tema those are the hands of a highly skilled surgeon was saved many lives

526
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,368
But how many people have you killed with those hands

527
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,952
You've got it wrong I'm not a killer

528
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,768
No but you change into Johan

529
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
When does the good doctor

530
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,864
Turn into the bad monster

531
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448

Emotionless taking of life

You really had us worried for a while

561
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
But you're looking quite well

562
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,384
Lots better than when you're running around investigating crimes

563
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,199
I guess this means you're not rid of me yet

564
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,503
Yeah you'll be back on your feet in no time

565
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,111
That emergency procedure you received before you got here was done perfectly

566
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,415
Your doctor said you wouldn't be alive without it

567
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,951
I'm assuming that

568
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,023
Got his hands-free and used them to save my life

569
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,583
Yeah well he got away but we got Gmail

570
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,631
He confessed a murdering the you'll pick couple

571
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,679
He stabbed you because you were on to him

572
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
You did good Lungi

573
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
Thank you

574
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Well

575
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
What do you think

576
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
About what

577
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,175
It's quite clear that 10 must save Luna's life

578
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,759
So I'm worried Lungi might have a problem pursuing him now

579
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,087
I'm wondering if I should remove them from the 10la case

580
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:39,231
I'm sorry did he call for you again inspector loon get can be very demanding

581
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,839
Oh he really isn't that difficult at all in fact I find him to be very pleasant

582
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:48,191
I keep telling him not to rush through the recovery process but he's quite determined

583
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:52,287
He's already working on strengthening his grip and he's taking long walks down the hall

584
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:56,895
He seems to be having a really fun time recovering fun

585
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:03,295
Yes he's always telling me that nothing has been more enjoyable for him than what was the suspect

586
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
What's the name again oh yes the most

587
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,791
It's funny you could ever have
