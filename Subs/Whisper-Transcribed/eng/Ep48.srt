1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,360
Are you okay, Mina?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,880
He was taken and dragged down these very steps.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,800
They took him away.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,000
Who was?

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,240
My big brother.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,400
Ah, yes.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,460
He was called the Man of Red Rose Mansion, I believe.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,340
What was his real name?

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,160
It was Franz Bonaparta.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,660
I see.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,160
Bonaparta.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
- I'm not certain if that was his actual name.

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,120
Bonaparta was also known to have a pseudonym.

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,840
- Why would he need one?

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,940
- Well, you see, he was also the author

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,060
of a children's book.

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,460
- I, I, I was reading a picture book in here.

18
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,740
Then the door opened, someone came back home.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,160
- Children's book?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,860
It was a strange picture book.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,320
It was called "The Nameless Monster".

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,280
There's nothing in here.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,240
Nina...

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,700
This memory is real.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,500
I've been here before.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,820
I was reading a picture book,

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,860
sitting here by myself.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,000
The one who opened the door and came back...

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,580
was me.

30
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,740
How could that be?

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,040
I was greeting myself.

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,320
Welcome home.

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,840
[Music]

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,400
[Music]

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,140
[Music]

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,760
[Music]

37
00:01:59,460 --> 00:01:59,980
[Music]

38
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,440
[MUSIC]

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,440
You're looking for Yon-Suk's mother?

40
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,380
Well then, Mrs. Suk is right down the hall in room 409.

41
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm sorry to say the poor dear's memory comes and goes in spurts.

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,640
You'll have to be patient with her.

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,240
(door creaking)

44
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,580
- Yan?

45
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,940
Is that you, dear?

46
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,340
- No.

47
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,220
- Oh my, what a beautiful girl.

48
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,340
Are you one of Yan's little friends?

49
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,580
- That's right.

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,180
- You've brought such pretty flowers.

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,160
- I'll put them right here.

52
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,100
How about that?

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,100
- I have to be very careful

54
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,960
so my Aunt Olga doesn't take them.

55
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,980
She's always coming around poking into my things

56
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,380
and taking what she wants.

57
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,020
She was in here yesterday,

58
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
and when I turned my back, she took my favorite doll.

59
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,480
- Well, she sounds perfectly horrid,

60
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,420
but I think she passed away over 10 years ago now.

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,560
Don't you remember that?

62
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,740
- Oh, that's right.

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,080
I'm surprised at how much you know.

64
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,320
- I've heard a lot from Yan, ma'am.

65
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,360
- I see.

66
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,840
Where is he?

67
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,220
Is it a school day?

68
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,180
Mm-mm.

69
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,240
Oh, of course.

70
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,040
He's already finished with that.

71
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,160
He's a detective.

72
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,960
Everything's fine. Your yawn is alright. There's nothing to worry about.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,260
I like talking to you. You have a sweet face and very kind eyes.

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,420
You can tell me about anything you want. Whatever you can remember.

75
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:09,660
Well, let me think. Katerina next door is very stylish and knows what the latest fashion trend will be even before it's...

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,460
Oh, this is so much fun.

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,460
It's been a while since I've had such a good time.

78
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,840
I'm glad to hear.

79
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,300
I must think of a way to thank you for your visit.

80
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,900
You don't need to do that.

81
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,480
Actually, though, I was really hoping that you would show me that thing

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,540
that Yan recently entrusted you with.

83
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,460
He entrusted me with something?

84
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,860
Yes, a cassette tape.

85
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,840
Of course I remember. There it is.

86
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,220
It never would have occurred to me that you would have sent them to Sook's mother.

87
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,340
It shouldn't take very long.

88
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,840
I'll wait here while you go in and collect the tape and the documents.

89
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,360
Make sure you don't forget about our arrangement.

90
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,360
Remember we did make a deal.

91
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,200
Come on, let's get going, Dr. Tenma.

92
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,280
I'm sorry that I said before this had nothing to do with you, Doctor.

93
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,280
No words can describe how I felt when you told me everything that you've been through.

94
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,360
The last ten years must have been horrible for you.

95
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,580
But this cassette tape may be the key to unlocking the whole story, and you'll be able to prove

96
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,160
When that happens, your entire life will change for the better.

97
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,480
But, Mr. Grimmer, what about your life?

98
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,420
Well, while it is true that I've been on a mission to investigate 511 Kinderheim and what it did to the children,

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,040
the truth is...

100
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,120
even if it all becomes clear, it won't lead to any big changes in my life.

101
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,720
(footsteps)

102
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,400
- So you're friends of Mr. Suke

103
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,720
and came to check up on his mother?

104
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,720
At the moment, she seems to be doing quite well.

105
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,580
- Good.

106
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,880
- You know, I think the conversation she had

107
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,060
with her other visitor today

108
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,520
really helped to lift her spirits.

109
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,860
- Other visitor?

110
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,240
What was their name?

111
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,440
- I don't know.

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,280
All I remember is she was a beautiful, long-haired blonde.

113
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,160
(grunting)

114
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
(panting)

115
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,820
- The tape!

116
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
- You actually did come.

117
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,180
I was told to expect you shortly, and here you are.

118
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,020
- The tape, where is it?

119
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,080
- Let me see.

120
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,940
Right here.

121
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,940
"I want to know how Yan's doing."

122
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,400
"At the moment, he's..."

123
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,220
"Take me to the hospital where I can see Yan."

124
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,300
"My Yan is in big trouble, isn't he?"

125
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,420
"My mind is alert and has been very clear since that pretty girl's visit."

126
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,740
"Talking to her reawakened my memories, but it might only last through the day."

127
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,180
"Please let me see Yan."

128
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,880
I will take you to the hospital where you can see your son.

129
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,380
Mr. Grimmer.

130
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,980
Turns out the secret police are willing to make a deal with us.

131
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,640
Mother, you're here.

132
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,440
Oh, Yan, why didn't you call me

133
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,840
so I could have come sooner?

134
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,560
I'm really all right.

135
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,300
It's nothing, nothing at all.

136
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,340
You're making light of it

137
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,740
to try to keep me from worrying, aren't you, dear?

138
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,980
Just like you did the last time.

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
The last time?

140
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,600
When you were nine years old,

141
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,520
you fell from that tree, don't you remember?

142
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,660
I was so worried,

143
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,040
Nothing was wrong and walked around claiming you felt just fine, but you had badly sprained your ankle

144
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,040
Dear God, please don't ever take him from my mind

145
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,840
Every day my mind slips a bit more so many things are fading away

146
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,300
Lord, let me remember. My son is the best child a mother ever had

147
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,740
Let's go back to that other question again.

148
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,420
What is it that you are the most afraid of?

149
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,960
The monster inside of me is getting bigger.

150
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,360
Munch, munch, chomp, chomp, gobble, gobble, go.

151
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,780
Munch, munch, chomp, chomp, gobble, gobble, go.

152
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,420
That's enough. I don't want to hear any more.

153
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,640
Regardless, you should listen to this. The nephew that you ended up sending to 511 Kinderheim

154
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,960
went through the same experience as this boy who was drugged and then interrogated on tape.

155
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,380
You should know what that experience entailed. You need to hear this.

156
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,660
I only listened this far into it the other day.

157
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,240
We need to hear more to get the full picture of what happened.

158
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,360
Let's continue on.

159
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:56,300
What I'm most afraid of, it's forgetting Anna.

160
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:04,080
The strange lessons we have every day are making my memories fade.

161
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,480
Please.

162
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:20,360
"Don't make me forget Anna. It's only Anna and me. In this whole world. Just give me that, please. Please. Please."

163
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,620
"That's all I can allow you to hear."

164
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,520
"I don't understand. Who's this young man talking on the tape?"

165
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,640
"What did he do? Did he erase the rest of the old recording?"

166
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,220
He didn't erase it, he taped over what was already there!

167
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,840
After listening to this tape, I finally figured it out.

168
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,180
Did the person who visited Sook's mother before record this?

169
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,240
Whose voice is it?

170
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,880
Dr. Tenma, what do you think?

171
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,220
I know this voice. It's what Johan sounds like today.

172
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,920
Where I must go...

173
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,080
I finally figured it out, Dr. Tenma.

174
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,140
He's on vacation?

175
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,120
That workaholic?

176
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,900
I can't believe it.

177
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,100

If you don't mind, I'd like to ask your advice.

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,380
The case we're currently working on

228
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,940
has grown into one big, tangled mess.

229
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,160
It involves a connection between the Prague Station

230
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,540
and the former Czechoslovakian secret police.

231
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,020
It all began when an inspector named Zeman

232
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,460
was found murdered, along with renegade members

233
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,440
of the secret police, which we thought

234
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,040
had been disbanded years ago.

235
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,980
At the time, Inspector Zeman had been conducting a murder

236
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,480
The victim had been running an unregistered orphanage.

237
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,980
We found out afterwards both Zemon and the orphanage director

238
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,040
had ties to the secret police.

239
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,720
This all happened before I took charge of this division.

240
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
Do you have any leads on the murderer?

241
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,040
A man named Grimmer, who discovered the orphanage director's body,

242
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,760
has surfaced as the leading suspect,

243
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,520
but the children saw someone else leaving the crime scene

244
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
immediately after the incident happened.

245
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,320
Who's the other person?

246
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,480
A pretty blonde woman.

247
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,500
That was just the beginning. This case has expanded.

Here's what we do know.

249
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,880
The former station chief and two of his veteran detectives were found murdered,

250
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,560
killed with poisoned candies.

251
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,340
As it turns out, those three dead officers

252
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,180
were involved with the Czechoslovakian secret police as well.

253
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,260
Do you know who gave them the poisoned candies?

254
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,020
We suspect a young detective named Jan Suk, who reported directly to Zayman.

255
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,140
Do you have any proof?

256
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,440
No, I'm afraid we have nothing conclusive.

257
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:04,280
But two detectives recently assigned to this division by a special investigative task force were found shot to death in detective Sook's apartment

So where's detective Sook now right now his whereabouts are unknown

260
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,240
The circumstantial evidence all points directly to Sook, but you're wondering if he has a sufficient motive

261
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,440
Yes, that's true. And he's not the kind of man who would normally commit such a crime

262
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,140
Yes, but uh, how do you know what kind of man he is?

00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,260

I was impressed when you said you can perform a completely subjective investigation,

269
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,260
