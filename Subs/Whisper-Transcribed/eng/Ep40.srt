1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,900
Just run. You have to go. The police are on their way.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,540
But I can't just...

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,520
Interested. The public square by the station. Wait there.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,780
Give me the message.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,880
Here it is.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,080
Shadok Bridge and the Three Frogs.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,140
My father said something else also.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,120
- If the monster that you're chasing happens to have a twin.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,120
- The mother of those same twins is still alive in Prague.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:29,980
We'll be right back.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:59,980
We'll be right back.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,980
To be continued...

13
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,680
So, Mr. Grimmer, have any luck?

14
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,460
Did you find some of the information you were looking for?

15
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,320
What you're after won't be easy to locate.

16
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,100
Record-keeping changed when the East and West united.

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,560
Data from before then is hard to find.

18
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,460
I thank you for this opportunity, Principal Garbrecht.

19
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,540
Frankly, I'm surprised you have even this much left.

20
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,700
Most have far less.

21
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,280
And, of course, you're quite correct.

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,880
When the Berlin Wall fell,

23
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,480
almost all of the data involving East Germany's unsavory practices

24
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,000
disappeared forever you know i feel quite sure that the children in the orphanages of the old

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,280
east germany were victims of physical and mental abuse but of course the real challenge here is

26
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,800
actually finding any written records to prove my thoughts are true your thinking sounds right

27
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,720
you know most of east germany's orphanages were being managed under the jurisdiction of the

28
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,240
ministry of health and welfare but a much bigger problem was created when the authorities classified

29
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,320
a child's parents as criminal offenders political prisoners spies or even illegal immigrants in the

30
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,800
midst of all of the orphanages that took care of these children there was one special orphanage

31
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,480
run by the notorious internal affairs ministry apparently there were many instances of abuse

32
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,880
and these inhumane personality corrections took place in that one particular orphanage

33
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,880
anyhow that's what i want to find out in as much detail as possible i want to know every last

34
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,720
little thing that happened there i'm leaving no stone unturned my that's a tedious task huh

35
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,040
i'd like to help but there's not much information to share most of those involved have passed away

36
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,640
kept silent or they're leading new lives i'm sure you're right even mr schneur who's now an

37
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,560
instructor here won't speak with me wait did you say mr schneur yes he was a teacher at east

38
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,080
germany's 6-2 kinderheim under the old regime i requested to interview him about his past but

39
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,360
You refused my request.

40
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,260
Listen, there's a real possibility Mr. Schnur terrorized children while he worked in East Germany,

41
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,840
so I'd be a little more cautious around him if I were you.

42
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,760
Hmm.

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,800
Oh, would it be all right if I photocopied some of the information in these books?

44
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,760
Sure, that would be just fine.

45
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,180
Uh, Mr. Grimmer, if I may, you are a newspaper journalist from West Germany, isn't that correct?

46
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,920
No, I'm from this side.

47
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,820
I worked as a reporter for a newspaper in Leipzig.

48
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,880
Well, I never expected a human rights advocate like you to be from the Eastern Bloc.

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,720
It's true.

50
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,980
During that time, I used to travel all over the world as a special overseas news correspondent.

51
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,360
Yeah, I went everywhere on missions for the government.

52
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,840
Do you understand?

53
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,800
I used to be a spy.

54
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,500
Here we go.

55
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,760
Goodness, your bag looks awfully heavy.

56
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,580
Well, it's packed with all the data I've collected traveling around East Germany.

57
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,360
I can't wait to read up on your findings.

58
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,920
So, where are you heading to next?

59
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,500
Oh, to the Czech Republic.

60
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,020
On to Prague.

61
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,800
Thank you for all your help, Principal.

62
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:57,740
I heard you're getting treated pretty badly by those boys.

63
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,520
And they ended up taking your shoes away, didn't they?

64
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,340
You know, crying won't help.

65
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:19,400
Hey, you know what?

66
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,820
It's been proven that people can live without shoes

67
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,060
After all, every last one of us was born barefoot

68
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,820
But I must say

69
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,740
Anyone who bullies other people by stealing their shoes

70
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,080
They're the worst

71
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,100
Anyhow, now you have shoes again, so there's no need to cry anymore.

72
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,540
Take care.

73
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,380
I'm guessing they're a little big for you, am I right?

74
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:17,220
Excuse me, sir?

75
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,900
Do you have a second, sir?

76
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,680
Of course. What is it?

77
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,860
I'm kind of in a fix.

78
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,860
You see, I have a big problem.

79
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,840
My briefcase that had my passport in it was stolen just a while ago.

80
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,160
Your passport was stolen. That really is a big problem.

81
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,720
I turned around and it was gone.

82
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,060
I'm on my way to see my younger sister, who lives in Vienna.

83
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,220
Only yesterday I got a phone call saying that she suddenly collapsed.

84
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,140
She collapsed? You need to find a way to get there as soon as possible.

85
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,840
Where are the police? Maybe they can help you.

86
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I already talked to them.

87
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,820
The bigger problem is my poor sister doesn't have any money for a doctor.

88
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,380
Oh, no. That's got to be the worst news yet.

89
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,300
And to top things off, my stolen briefcase had my wallet in it, too.

90
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,600
No.

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,900
I know I can't go, but if I could at least find a way to wire some money to my sister,

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
she could get some medical attention.

93
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,220
But now it's looking like I can't even do that.

94
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,280
So, just how much do you need?

95
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,480
Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't need to help out.

96
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,620
Honestly, I don't need that much money. Really.

97
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,700
All I need is to pull together a small amount of cash,

98
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,520
just enough so she can see a doctor.

99
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,460
Here. I'm just sorry I don't have more to give you.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,320
Oh, thank you, sir.

101
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,340
Dankeschön.

102
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,800
I swear that I'll pay you back very soon.

103
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,260
Just write down the address where you want me to send the check.

104
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,240
That's all right. No need to repay me.

105
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,700
Just see that your sister gets the help she needs, okay?

106
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,800
God bless you, sir. Thank you so much.

107
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,880
I wish you and your sister all the best.

108
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,480
Come on, buddy. How could you hand over your money to that hustler?

109
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:49,960
Huh?

110
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,580
He was lying. His story was just a scam.

111
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,500
A scam?

112
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,940
That guy works this train station all the time looking for suckers like you.

113
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,700
I can't believe you got fooled by that hustler.

114
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,220
I really got fooled?

115
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,800
Attention. The express train to Prague will be departing from track 7 at 3.15 p.m.

116
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,820
Damn it.

117
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:30,880
I didn't think it was going to make it for a sec.

118
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,960
Thanks for your help.

119
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,560
You're welcome.

120
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,540
Hmm.

121
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,960
Hey, thanks again for earlier.

122
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,780
You mind if I sit here?

123
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,880
No, go ahead.

124
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,800
So, where are you headed?

125
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,640
Oh, me? I'm headed for Prague.

126
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,780
I'm guessing you're Japanese, am I right?

127
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:26,880
Huh?

128
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,380
Konnichiwa.

129
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,880
Oh, domo.

130
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,520
You know, I visited Japan a couple of times.

131
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,260
Oh.

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,480
How long's it been since I was there last?

133
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,420
Well, it's been a couple of years, I can tell you that much.

134
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,160
The last time I was over there, it was a business trip.

135
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,780
I went to Akihabara to purchase some wiretap equipment and other high-tech gadgets.

136
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,640
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.

137
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,740
This song, it was really popular.

138
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,240
I'm sure you know it.

139
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,180
No, no, wait, that's not right.

140
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,460
It's...

141
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,060
Oh, that's right, that's how it goes.

142
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,460
Oh, and there were these robots.

143
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,360
My son would have loved it if I'd brought back a plastic model toy for him.

144
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,100
So, where's your son now?

145
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,520
Oh, he's gone. My son died.

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,420
Departure passport check. If you would present your passport.

147
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
Oh, sure. Of course.

148
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,480
Dankeschön.

149
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:57,480
Look, there's the Elbe River.

150
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,580
How's the trout fishing been on the Elbe River this year anyway?

151
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,340
It hasn't been very good, sir.

152
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,820
Oh, is that so?

153
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,200
Because last year I caught a trout this big on that river.

154
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,180
That wouldn't happen this year.

155
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,840
Dankeschön, sir.

156
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:27,520
He's on to the fact that was a fake passport you just showed him.

157
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,020
You need to get moving. Right now, Dr. Tenma.

158
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,640
How is it that you know who I am?

159
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
That's not important.

160
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,940
What does matter here is that the border police have realized your passport's a fake and I'm sure they're on their way.

161
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,720
So you need to get out of here right now, Dr. Tenma.

162
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,320
Move it, you.

163
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,240
Come on, we need to get past you.

164
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,500
Sorry about this, guys.

165
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,040
My duffel bag so big and overstuffed. I guess I'm kind of stuck here. I can't seem to move get out of the way

166
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,520
Right now believe me sir. I am trying to get out of the way. What's in that bag anyway?

167
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
some very valuable items

168
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
Good I finally got loose

169
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:43,660
do you know where that other man went answer me huh there was an asian man who was sitting with

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,280

171
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,960
move men check the next car yes sir this is passenger car two emergency we have an asian

172
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:02,880
man using a big passport who's running loose on this train what's wrong stop this train immediately

173
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:31,300
You did very well back there.

174
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,820
They're not chasing us. They're searching the other way.

175
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,420
Since the train was stopped, I figured I should get off.

176
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,680
Oh, I guess I forgot to introduce myself, Doctor. My name's Grimmer.

177
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,040
I thought you might need some guidance, Dr. Tenma, so if you'd like, I could show you the way to the border.

178
00:14:51,040 --> 00:15:04,280
I'm very well acquainted with this area

179
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,940
Actually, I've fished around here quite a few times

180
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,160
It's mountainous terrain, so the hike ain't easy, but the view is great

181
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,860
Grimmer, why did you help me anyway?

182
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,520
Huh?

183
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:25,740
Oh. Well, you see, I worked for a newspaper company in East Germany, but now I'm doing my own thing as a freelance journalist.

184
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,780
I've read every article about you I could find, and I have to admit I find you very interesting.

185
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,620
Being falsely accused of crimes was a part of everyday life in East Germany.

186
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,160
Political prisoners charged without merit, accused murderers who weren't really guilty.

187
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:49,020
Actually, seeing that happen all the time, you got to have a pretty good eye for spotting who was guilty and who was innocent.

188
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,420
And I'd say you're innocent. Does that sound about right, Dr. Tenma?

189
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,180
Listen, do me a favor and stop calling me doctor.

190
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,720
Huh? But Dr. Tenma, you're one of the world's most brilliant neurosurgeons. Aren't you proud of that?

191
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,460
I am no longer a doctor!

192
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:24,000
so what do you think it's a magnificent view isn't it and from here we can see

193
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,700
anyone coming up the mountain after us that said I think we've earned a

194
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:36,680
well-deserved break for lunch would you care to join me for a sandwich I also

195
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,860
brought a rather nice red wine oh and some delicious cheese thank you for your

196
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,860
but I really need to keep on moving.

197
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,860
It's hours until sunset.

198
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,860
It'll be easier and safer trying to cross the border after dark.

199
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Eating outside like this is just the best.

200
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,860
It's such a treat to do this once in a while, isn't it, Dr. Tenma?

201
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,860
Enjoying delicious food while taking in a wonderful view.

202
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,860
It's moments like this that help me truly feel the pleasures of living.

203
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:17,020
I must admit, I have a profound respect for you, doctors.

204
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,120
Journalists like myself serve to entertain people,

205
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,980
and hopefully my readers feel happier to be alive after reading my articles.

206
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,740
But what you do, that's powerful.

207
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,280
You literally give people life.

208
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,520
But I...

209
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,660
I shot a man, and I did it on purpose.

210
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:48,420
It happened last month in Munich.

211
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,760
It's the first time I shot someone.

212
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,340
I think he probably died.

213
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,940
My hands were trembling so much I couldn't aim.

214
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,360
I didn't think I'd really be able to do it.

215
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,940
But after I shot him, my hands stopped trembling.

216
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:18,180
Now I know that I have to shoot another man. I have to stop a man. That's pure evil

217
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,120
One thing is for certain I'm no doctor

218
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:43,980
When I see the Elba River, I think of how I'd give anything to change the past.

219
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,900
Yeah, I would have made a difference, so I could have shared the joy of fishing here with my son.

220
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,380
What was he like, your little boy?

221
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,960
You can catch a trout this big in that river.

222
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,020
My poor son died without me ever sharing the pleasures of the outdoors with him.

223
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,380
What makes me the saddest is feeling that his life could have been saved

224
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,920
if a doctor like you had been there for him.

225
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,140
I swear, you can catch trout this big. I'm not kidding around here.

226
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:29,500
The other side of that mountain is the Czech border.

227
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,440
Follow the forest path past there and you'll hit a road where you might be able to get a ride.

228
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,800
As for me, I'm heading back to the train station now.

229
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,000
Thank you, Mr. Grimmer. I never would have made it this far without you helping me.

230
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,460
I truly wish you the best of luck, Dr. Tenma.

231
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:53,140
Say, if we meet again, let's plan for another great picnic, all right?

232
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,080
Hey, Dr. Tenma.

233
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,200
Everyone in this world carries around their own sins, and they never go away.

234
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,240
But that doesn't change the fact that we do what we must.

235
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:45,800
Ah, how wonderful.

236
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,640
I'd always heard this was a beautiful city.

237
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,020
This may be my first night in Prague, but I'm already enchanted.

238
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,660
It's like a village from a fairy tale.

239
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,320
Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?

240
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,160
Suit yourself.

241
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:16,560
I must say, I'm completely captivated by this city.

242
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,340
You're Mr. Petrov, right?

243
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,960
You bought your Russian citizenship, and now here you are, living in Prague.

244
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,080
I'd like to ask you some things about your past, sir.

245
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,000
Would you be willing to help me with some answers, Mr. Petrov?

246
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,340
Oh, my mistake. Your real name is Reinhard Biermann, isn't it?

247
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:41,120
There was this very special orphanage located in East Berlin, right?

248
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,200
It was more of a laboratory, really, where experiments were conducted on children's personalities.

249
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,680
It was called 511 Kinderheim, and you were the director there, Mr. Biermann.

250
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,380
You should know all about the abuse that went on there.

251
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,040
After all, sir, you were the one running the place.

252
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,620
Just what were you trying to achieve in those experiments?

253
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,740
Back in East Berlin at 5-1-1 Kinderheim care to explain it to me
