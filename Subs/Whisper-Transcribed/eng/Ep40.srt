1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,900
Just run. You have to go. The police are on their way.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,300
But I can't just...

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,520
Interested. The public square by the station. Wait there.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,800
Give me the message.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,900
Here it is.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,020
Shidok Bridge and the Three Frogs.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,100
My father said something else also.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,160
What if the monster that you're chasing happens to have a twin?

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,400
The mother of those same twins is still alive in Prague.

10
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,340
(dramatic music)

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,320
- There!

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,620
Hey, guys!

13
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:14,740
(laughing)

14
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,760
Over here!

15
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,860
Over here, you guys!

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,800
- Cut it out, guys!

17
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,020
Give me back my shoe!

18
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,740
- Cut it!

19
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,800
Here you go!

20
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,160
- It's not yours anymore!

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,520
- No way, cut it!

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,180
- Come on!

23
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,280
Stop messing around already!

24
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:25,860
- Give it back!

25
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,700
- Yeah, kick it to me!

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
(children laughing)

27
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,700
- So, Mr. Grimmer, have any luck?

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,460
Did you find some of the information you were looking for?

29
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,220
What you're after won't be easy to locate.

30
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,100
Record keeping changed when the East and West united.

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,540
Data from before then is hard to find.

32
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,480
- I thank you for this opportunity, Principal Garbrecht.

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,540
Frankly, I'm surprised you have even this much left.

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,700
Most have far less.

35
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,260
And of course, you're quite correct.

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,900
When the Berlin Wall fell,

37
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,380
Well, almost all of the data involving East Germany's unsavory practices disappeared forever.

38
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:07,800
You know, I feel quite sure that the children in the orphanages of the old East Germany were victims of physical and mental abuse.

39
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,400
But of course, the real challenge here is actually finding any written records to prove my thoughts are true.

40
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,580
Your thinking sounds right.

41
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,220
You know, most of East Germany's orphanages were being managed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

42
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,100
But a much bigger problem was created when the authorities classified a child's parents

43
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,520
as criminal offenders, political prisoners, spies, or even illegal immigrants.

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,820
In the midst of all of the orphanages that took care of these children, there was one

45
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,280
special orphanage run by the notorious Internal Affairs Ministry.

46
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,440
Apparently there were many instances of abuse, and these inhumane personality corrections

47
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,940
took place in that one particular orphanage.

48
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,140
Anyhow, that's what I want to find out, in as much detail as possible.

49
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,280
every last little thing that happened there.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm leaving no stone unturned.

51
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,760
- My, that's a tedious task, huh?

52
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,260
I'd like to help, but there's not much information to share.

53
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,980
Most of those involved have passed away,

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,080
kept silent, or they're leading new lives.

55
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,580
- I'm sure you're right.

56
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,440
Even Mr. Schnurr, who's now an instructor here,

57
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,320
won't speak with me.

58
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,480
- Wait, did you say Mr. Schnurr?

59
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,140
- Yes, he was a teacher at East Germany's

60
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,140
6-2 Kinderheim under the old regime.

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,720
I requested to interview him about his past,

62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,360
You refused my request.

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,380
Listen, there's a real possibility

64
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,060
Mr. Schnurr terrorized children

65
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,240
while he worked in East Germany,

66
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,840
so I'd be a little more cautious around him if I were you.

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,320
Oh, would it be all right if I photocopied

68
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,800
some of the information in these books?

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,760
- Sure, that would be just fine.

70
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,400
Mr. Grimmer, if I may, you are a newspaper journalist

71
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,080
from West Germany, isn't that correct?

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,900
- No, I'm from this side.

73
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,800
I worked as a reporter for a newspaper in Leipzig.

74
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,820
Well, I never expected a human rights advocate like you to be from the Eastern Bloc.

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,700
It's true.

76
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,980
During that time, I used to travel all over the world as a special overseas news correspondent.

77
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,400
Yeah, I went everywhere on missions for the government.

78
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,840
Do you understand?

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,800
I used to be a spy.

80
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,500
Here we go.

81
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,760
Goodness, your bag looks awfully heavy.

82
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,600
Well, it's packed with all the data I've collected traveling around East Germany.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,360
I can't wait to read up on your findings.

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,900
So, where are you heading to next?

85
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,520
Oh, to the Czech Republic.

86
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,820
On to Prague. Thank you for all your help, Principal.

87
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,600
(crying)

88
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,760
I heard you're getting treated pretty badly by those boys.

89
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,520
And they ended up taking your shoes away, didn't they?

90
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,340
You know, crying won't help.

91
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,820
(crying)

92
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,040
Hmph.

93
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,420
(sobbing)

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
- Hey, you know what?

95
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,820
It's been proven that people can live without shoes.

96
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,060
After all, every last one of us was born barefoot.

97
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,800
But I must say,

98
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,740
anyone who bullies other people by stealing their shoes,

99
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,020
they're the worst.

100
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,520
Anyhow, now you have shoes again,

101
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,060
so there's no need to cry anymore.

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,380
I'm guessing they're a little big for you, am I right?

103
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,200
Excuse me, sir?

104
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,900
Do you have a second, sir?

105
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,700
Of course. What is it?

106
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,860
I'm kind of in a fix.

107
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,840
You see, I have a big problem.

108
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,840
My briefcase that had my passport in it was stolen just a while ago.

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,160
Your passport was stolen? That really is a big problem.

110
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I turned around and it was gone.

111
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,400
I'm on my way to see my younger sister who lives in Vienna only yesterday

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,160
I got a phone call saying that she suddenly collapsed. She collapsed. You need to find a way to get there as soon as possible

113
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,060
Where are the police? Maybe they can help you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I already talked to them

114
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,860
The bigger problem is my poor sister doesn't have any money for a doctor

115
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,360
Oh, no, that's got to be the worst news yet and to top things off my stolen briefcase had my wallet in it, too

116
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,900
No, I know I can't go but if I could at least find a way to wire some money to my sister

117
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,240
She could get some medical attention, but now it's looking like I can't even do that

118
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,480
So just how much do you need? Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't need to help out

119
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,180
Honestly, I don't need that much money

120
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,660
Really?

121
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,500
All I need is to pull together a small amount of cash just enough so she can see a doctor here

122
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm just sorry. I don't have more to give you. Oh

123
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,820
Thank you, sir. Don't cushion. I swear that I'll pay you back very soon

124
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,280
Just write down the address where you want me to send the check.

125
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,240
That's all right. No need to repay me.

126
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,700
Just see that your sister gets the help she needs, okay?

127
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,800
God bless you, sir! Thank you so much!

128
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
I wish you and your sister all the best!

129
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,480
Come on, buddy. How could you hand over your money to that hustler?

130
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:49,960
Huh?

131
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,540
He was lying. His story was just a scam.

132
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,440
A scam?

133
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,940
That guy works this train station all the time looking for suckers like you.

134
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,680
I can't believe you got fooled by that hustler.

135
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,240
I really got fooled?

136
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,760
Attention. The express train to Prague will be departing from track 7 at 3.15pm.

137
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,820
Dammit!

138
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,960
I didn't think it was going to make it for a sec. Thanks for your help.

139
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,980
Hey, thanks again for earlier.

140
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,780
You mind if I sit here?

141
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,880
No, go ahead.

142
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,820
So, where are you headed?

143
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,520
Oh, me?

144
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
I'm headed for Prague.

145
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm guessing you're Japanese, am I right?

146
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:26,860
Huh?

147
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,400
Konnichiwa.

148
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,860
Oh, domo.

149
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,540
You know, I've visited Japan a couple of times.

150
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,260
Oh.

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,480
How long's it been since I was there last?

152
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,420
Well, it's been a couple of years, I can tell you that much.

153
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,160
The last time I was over there was a business trip.

154
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,800
I went to Akihabara to purchase some wiretap equipment and other high-tech gadgets.

155
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,640
Oh yeah, that reminds me.

156
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,740
This song, it was really popular.

157
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,940
I'm sure you know it.

158
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,500
"Kita no hakaba dori ni wa"

159
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,200
No, no, that's not right.

160
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,000
"Kita no..."

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,140
It's "sakaba dori ni wa."

162
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,040
Oh, that's right. That's how it goes.

163
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,680
"Kita no sakaba dori ni wa"

164
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,460
Oh, and there were these robots.

165
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,360
My son would have loved it if I'd brought back a plastic model toy for him.

166
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,080
So where's your son now?

167
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,520
Oh, he's gone. My son died.

168
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,440
Departure passport check. If you would present your passport.

169
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
Oh, sure. Of course.

170
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,280
Thank you.

171
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,480
Look, there's the Elba River.

172
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,580
How's the trout fishing been on the Elba River this year anyway?

173
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,340
It hasn't been very good, sir.

174
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,800
Oh, is that so?

175
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,200
'Cause last year I caught a trout this big on that river.

176
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,180
That wouldn't happen this year.

177
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,840
Dankeschön, sir.

178
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,980
He's on to the fact that was a fake passport you just showed him.

179
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,400
You need to get moving.

180
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,020
Right now, Dr. Tenma.

181
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,640
How is it that you know who I am?

182
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,780
That's not important.

183
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,940
What does matter here is that the border police have realized your passport's a fake, and I'm sure they're on their way.

184
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,720
So you need to get out of here right now, Dr. Tenma.

185
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,340
Move it, you.

186
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,220
Come on, we need to get past you.

187
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:17,260
Sorry about this, guys. My duffel bag's so big and overstuffed, I guess I'm kind of stuck here. I can't seem to move.

188
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,680
Get out of the way right now!

189
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,820
Believe me, sir, I am trying to get out of the way.

190
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,500
What's in that bag anyway?

191
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,000
Some very valuable items.

192
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,080
Oh good, I finally got loose.

193
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,220
(dramatic music)

194
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,140
- Do you know where that other man went?

195
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,880
Answer me!

196
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,460
- Huh?

197
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,800
- There was an Asian man who was sitting with you

198
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,520
in this compartment.

199
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,020
- Yeah, you're right.

200
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,220
Well, maybe he got hungry and went to the dining car.

201
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:48,840
- Move, men.

202
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,040
Check the next car.

203
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,620
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

204
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,980
- This is passenger car two.

205
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,600
Emergency.

206
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,280
We have an Asian man using a fake passport

207
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,720
who's running loose on this train.

208
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,400
- What's wrong?

209
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,900
Stop this train immediately!

210
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
You did very well back there

211
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,860
They're not chasing us they're searching the other way

212
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:46,160
Since the train was stopped. I figured I should get off. Oh, I guess I forgot to introduce myself doctor. My name is Grimmer. I

213
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,080
Thought you might need some guidance dr. Tenma, so if you'd like I could show you the way to the border

214
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,260
I'm very well acquainted with this area.

215
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,900
Actually, I fished around here quite a few times.

216
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,140
It's mountainous terrain, so the hike ain't easy, but the view is great.

217
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,380
Grimmer.

218
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,780
Why did you help me, anyway?

219
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,500
Huh?

220
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:17,860
Oh.

221
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,040
Well, you see, I worked for a newspaper company in East Germany,

222
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,580
but now I'm doing my own thing as a freelance journalist.

223
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,760
I've read every article about you I could find, and I have to admit I find you very interesting.

224
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,620
Being falsely accused of crimes was a part of everyday life in East Germany.

225
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,160
Political prisoners charged without merit, accused murderers who weren't really guilty.

226
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,000
Seeing that happen all the time, you got to have a pretty good eye for spotting who was guilty and who was innocent.

227
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,440
And I'd say you're innocent. Does that sound about right, Dr. Tenma?

228
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,240
Listen, do me a favor and stop calling me doctor.

229
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,400
Huh?

230
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,700
But Dr. Tenma, you're one of the world's most brilliant neurosurgeons. Aren't you proud of that?

231
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,500
I am no longer a doctor!

232
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,160
So, what do you think?

233
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,400
It's a magnificent view, isn't it?

234
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,920
And from here we can see anyone coming up the mountain after us.

235
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,240
That said, I think we've earned a well-deserved break for lunch.

236
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,600
Would you care to join me for a sandwich?

237
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,240
I also brought a rather nice red wine.

238
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,380
Oh, and some delicious cheese.

239
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,220
Thank you for your offer, but I really need to keep on moving.

240
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,680
It's hours until sunset.

241
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,260
It'll be easier and safer trying to cross the border after dark.

242
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,420
[MUSIC PLAYING]

243
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,460
Meeting outside like this is just the best.

244
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,940
It's such a treat to do this once in a while,

245
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,060
isn't it, Dr. Tenma?

246
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,800
Enjoying delicious food while taking in a wonderful view.

247
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,240
It's moments like this that help me truly

248
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,500
feel the pleasures of living.

249
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,020
I must admit, I have a profound respect for you doctors.

250
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,140
Journalists like myself serve to entertain people,

251
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,760
Others feel happier to be alive after reading my articles, but what you do, that's powerful.

252
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,280
You literally give people life.

253
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,460
But I...

254
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
I shot a man, and I did it on purpose.

255
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,420
It happened last month in Munich.

256
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,780
It's the first time I shot someone.

257
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,360
I think he probably died.

258
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,940
My hands were trembling so much I couldn't aim.

259
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,380
I didn't think I'd really be able to do it.

260
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,900
But after I shot him, my hands stopped trembling.

261
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,520
And now, I know that I have to shoot another man.

262
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,180
I have to stop a man that's pure evil.

263
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,520
One thing is for certain...

264
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,060
I'm no doctor.

265
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,980
When I see the Elba River, I think of how I'd give anything to change the past.

266
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,900
I made a difference so I could have shared the joy of fishing here with my son.

267
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,400
What was he like, your little boy?

268
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,940
You can catch a trout this big in that river.

269
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,020
My poor son died without me ever sharing the pleasures of the outdoors with him.

270
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,400
What makes me the saddest is feeling that his life could have been saved

271
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,900
if a doctor like you had been there for him.

272
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,860
I swear, you can catch trout this big.

273
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,180
I'm not kidding around here.

274
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,500
The other side of that mountain is the Czech border.

275
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,020
Follow the forest path past there and you'll hit a road where you might be able to get

276
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,420
a ride.

277
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,820
As for me, I'm heading back to the train station now.

278
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,060
I never would have made it this far without you helping me.

279
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,460
I truly wish you the best of luck, Dr. Tenma.

280
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,060
Say, if we meet again, let's plan for another great picnic, alright?

281
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,120
Hey, Dr. Tenma!

282
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,560
Everyone in this world carries around their own sins.

283
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,200
And they never go away.

284
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,260
But that doesn't change the fact that we do what we must.

285
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,840
Ah, how wonderful.

286
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,640
I'd always heard this was a beautiful city.

287
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,020
This may be my first night in Prague, but I'm already enchanted.

288
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,660
It's like a village from a fairy tale.

289
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,340
Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?

290
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,200
Sit yourself.

291
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,560
I must say, I'm completely captivated by this city.

292
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,340
You're Mr. Pedrov, right?

293
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,960
You bought your Russian citizenship, and now here you are, living in Prague.

294
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,080
I'd like to ask you some things about your past, sir.

295
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,200
Would you be willing to help me with some answers, Mr. Pedroff?

296
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,340
Oh, my mistake. Your real name is Reinhard Biermann, isn't it?

297
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,140
There was this very special orphanage located in East Berlin, right?

298
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,180
It was more of a laboratory, really, where experiments were conducted on children's personalities.

299
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,700
It was called 511 Kinderheim, and you were the director there, Mr. Biermann.

300
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,380
You should know all about the abuse that went on there.

301
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,060
After all, sir, you were the one running the place.

302
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,940
Just what were you trying to achieve in those experiments back in East Berlin?

303
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,800
At 511 Kinderheim. Care to explain it to me?
