00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,360
Placed in Badenburg prison to serve time, and in 1991 devised a means of escape, spent

six months filing through the iron bars of his cell with a large nail sharpened into

My path in life was chosen on that fateful day, when my father was found guilty.

110
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,900
After the war, my father moved from Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia to Germany, starting a small

111
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,820
radio station there in 1949.

112
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,400
But in the '60s, during the Cold War between East and West Germany, he was arrested for

113
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,700
being a spy and for the murder of a federal politician's

114
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,160
secretary.

115
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,600
This news shocked the West.

116
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,940
My father proclaimed his innocence,

117
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,900
but was convicted to 20 years in prison.

118
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,800

died in prison a year later in 1972.

After graduating from Dusseldorf University,

I joined the large firm of Hoffman Law.

126

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,960

To honor his memory, I want to be involved in as many cases as possible

141
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,700
may be falsely accused.

Yes. Is he the one you mentioned earlier?

150
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,600
He is. A man by the name of Alfred Ball.

151
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,400
He asked me if I wanted to team up with him on the Dr. Tenma murder case.

152
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,880
Well, if I remember correctly, you already refused to take Dr. Tenma's case.

153
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,880
Mm. But at the time, I was being solicited by Hans Georg Schuwald.

154
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,120
And it wasn't made clear to me then why I was being asked by that business tycoon to be the doctor's legal counsel.

155
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,880
However, the reasons Mr. Ball had were all perfectly clear.

156
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,400
What were they?

157
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,260
Every one of Mr. Ball's clients was a former patient of Dr. Tenma,

158
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,540
and he'd saved the lives of all of them before he went on the run.

159
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,840
And now, I'm certain about one thing.

160
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,680
Dr. Tenma was a well-respected and highly skilled surgeon.

161
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,120
So, are you taking the case?

162
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,980
Yes, but if I had made that decision when the billionaire was footing the bill,

163
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,540
we could have made quite a nice profit.

164
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,460
I doubt these patients will be able to pay nearly as much.

165
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,960
your legal work only for the money,

166
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,100
then you'd have a much larger firm by now.

We'd better make sure you order enough food for two.

176
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,520
The baby always kicks when it gets to be dinner time.

177
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,680
So dear, what restaurant would you like to go to tonight?

178
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,740
I don't know.

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,960
How about that place we saw last week?

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And then he just disappeared into the blazing fire.

181
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,840
And that was the very last time I ever saw Johan.

182
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,160
Do you want me to start my story from the beginning one more time?

183
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,700
Because I'm gonna keep on telling the truth over and over as long as it takes.

184
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,980
You're the fourth one, you know.

185
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,100
The other three who wanted to represent me all had the same suggestion.

186
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,360
That I should confess to some of the charges, admit to part of the crimes, delight in my sentence.

187
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,300
That's all they wanted to talk about.

188
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,960
I'd assumed as much.

189
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,960
It seems to me you don't really care too deeply about proving your innocence.

190
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,640
You apparently would rather spend your time proving the existence of a certain young man named Johan.

191
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,740
Yes, that's right.

192
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,100
Legal expertise won't help with that.

193
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,240
Dr. Tenma, when did these events all start happening?

194
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,200
Like I've been saying, when a boy with a gunshot wound to the head was brought into the emergency--

195
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,000
I know, but something must have happened before that, so what was it?

196
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,480
A Turkish woman was yelling at me.

197
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,460
Give me back my husband!

198
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,220
After all, people's lives aren't created equal.

199
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,980
But human lives are created equal.

200
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,560
Was what I did back then really the right thing to have done?

201
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,640
I just don't know.

202
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,940
There's no way of telling if a patient is good or evil.

203
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,580
My only crime is that I went ahead and saved the life of a little boy.

204
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,840
I don't know.

205
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,240
But...do doctors even have the right to choose who they treat based on the quality of a patient's soul?

206
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,340
People's lives aren't created equal.

207
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,540
They are all equal. I can't explain it, but I know that it's the truth.

208
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,620
It's the same way with lawyers.

209
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,580
We can't tell what kind of a person the accused is.

210
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,480
Here's a list of names of the people who asked me to represent you in these legal proceedings,

211
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,920
Doctor.

212
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,640
Mr. Mikhail Hodder, Mr. Stefan Krump, also Mr. Franz Kiefer, and Mr. Rudolf Huber.

213
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,860
Mr. Kiefer and Mr. Huber, glad to know they're fine.

214
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,220
Mr. Horst Hentschel, Mr. Harmut Hess.

215
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,020
Mr. Hess as well, it's good to hear.

216
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,080
I hope he's enjoying his grandkids, they're his whole world.

217
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,740
Time's up.

218
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,400
Thank goodness for that. They're all okay.

219
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,520
Dr. Tenma, I will accept your case. I'll represent you.

220
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,360
You know, lawyers can't tell what's inside a client's heart either.

221
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,980
There's only one thing we can do when we represent someone.

222
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,840
Try to have faith in him.

223
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,900
One more. Didn't you hear me? I said one more!

224
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,440
Ma'am, you've had enough.

225
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,120
Since when did this bar start refusing to serve its best customer?

226
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,620
Hey! You just laughed at me, didn't you?

227
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,740
No, not at all.

228
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,500
Yes, you did! You looked over at me with a big laugh!

229
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,540
Hey, hey, I know you!

230
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,640
You were always there, coming to our house with your hat in your hand, groveling.

231
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,180
You're the vice branch manager at Nordrein West Bank.

232
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,300
Don't give me that look! I can drink here if I damn well wanna!

233
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,040
Whether you like it or not, Eva Heinemann has returned home to Dusseldorf!

234
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,140
You've certainly brought me a wealth of important information. Thank you, Dr. Reitwein.

235
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,420
Listen, I've been trying to reach you ever since I heard that Dr. Tenma had retained you to represent him.

236
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,280
I'm sorry you had so much trouble. I've been out investigating everywhere.

237
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,360
Investigating?

238
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,820
That's right. I've been meeting with the former patients of Dr. Tenma who hired me on in this case.

239
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,320
Did you learn anything?

240
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,160
Well, just that they think he's wonderful and that they owe their lives to him.

241
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,480
But did you get any evidence that would be useful?

242
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,520
- Not really.

243
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,860
I'm hoping to find a witness or someone

244
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,880
who can provide Dr. Tenma with an alibi.

245
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,320
- In my opinion, to establish Tenma's innocence,

246
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,660
we need to prove to the world that Johan actually exists.

247
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,540
- Listen, Dr. Reichwein.

248
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,000
- What?

249
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,620
- Regarding that part about Dr. Tenma

250
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,780
planning to shoot that young man named Johan,

251
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,520
when you're called to testify, please omit that.

252
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,020
- Huh?

253
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,320
But wait a minute, my testimony about his plan

254
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,600
There is a Johan whether or not Johan exists. Dr. Tenma is innocent

255
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:39,380
Please hear me out. Dr. Reich vine the country wants this case closed. So any scapegoat will do right now

256
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:46,220
My child will be born soon. I want him to live in a world where true justice exists

257
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,320
Judges and prosecutors want to bring matters to a close quickly in order to do so

258
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,660
they carelessly rushed to condemn innocent people as guilty.

259
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,180
It's high time this country repented

260
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,840
for its lack of true justice,

261
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,780
and that's what's most important.

262
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,800
Well, Dr. Reichwein?

263
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,760
- Yes, that's right.

264
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,160
- Anyhow, I'm looking for a particular witness at the moment.

265
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,700
- Oh?

266
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,500
- She might know something

267
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,900
which could prove vital to Dr. Tenma's defense.

268
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,440
At least I hope so.

269
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,280
- Who is she?

270
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,560
- None other than my client's former fiancee,

271
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,860
Miss Eva Heinemann.

272
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,620
Is something wrong, Dr. Reikvein? You look surprised.

273
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,440
She's here in town.

274
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:26,820
Huh?

275
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,180
She came here with me. I guess she's decided to move back.

276
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,180
But that woman...

277
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,160
They were laughing.

278
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,380
Every last one of them was laughing.

279
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,640
They just give me one look and start in.

280
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,080
Ava, are you listening to me?

281
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,340
Quit bugging me. You're so annoying.

282
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,280
Just meet with the lawyer.

283
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,020
Is that for Tenma? Please!

284
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,720
Huh? Your memory's kinda shot, Gramps.

285
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,160
I told you before, I tried to shoot him once, but I couldn't pull it off.

286
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,980
I remember that quite well, but I was surprised to hear it.

287
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,760
But you didn't go through with shooting him.

288
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,900
That's right, I didn't shoot him. Do you know why?

289
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,380
It's because I can't have him die on me yet!

290
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,600
That man ruined my life. A fast death would be too easy.

291
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,040
to rot in jail for eternity to make him regret it.

292
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,940
I'm going to lock him up for the rest of his life.

293
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,640
He'll be sorry he left me when I'm through with him.

294
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,480
Yeah, maybe then he'll regret that he dumped me.

295
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,440
Passed out again.

296
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,280
You were asleep, you must have had a bad dream.

297
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,300
Three shots from the gun, but I didn't see anything.

298
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,480
I...I didn't...didn't see it.

299
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,320
Blond-haired man...blond-haired man...

300
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,860
Ava! Who did you see?

301
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,900
Did you see Johan that night?

302
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,140
"Over the Rainbow."

305
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,920
- Hello, Mr. Werdemann.

306
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:52,680
- What?

307
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,920
I've gotta be there.

308
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,340
Mr. Klinger, contact Mr. Ball immediately.

309
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,060
- Right.

310
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,260
- Ask him if he'll be able to meet with Dr. Tenma

311
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,900
in my place, because I'm having a baby.

312
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,380
- Nice to meet you.

313
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm Alfred Ball.

314
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,000
Mr. Werdemann asked me if I could come meet with you today.

315
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,580
How are you doing?

316
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,240
Getting enough sleep in this place?

317
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,360
- I guess.

318
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,780
- Well, that's good.

319
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:16,800
Oh.

320
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,840
I used to be right-handed, actually.

321
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,760
I'm still having a little trouble adjusting to holding a pen in my left to write notes.

322
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,940
You see, my right hand doesn't work too well anymore.

323
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,680
Perhaps you remember me now.

324
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,020
I know I've lost quite a bit of weight.

325
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,620
Yep, I gotta admit, I even impressed myself to think that I was able to escape that sea

326
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,280
You caught me by surprise when you actually shot me.

327
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,100
You know, it's kind of funny. I can't seem to hold pens worth a damn, but...

328
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,400
yet I'm able to handle a gun just fine.

329
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,520
To tell you the truth, I'm thinking of killing someone.

330
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,240
I'm thinking of killing your former fiancée,

331
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,780
the lovely Ava Heinemann.
