right eight zero proline yes sir

We'll be right back.

We'll be right back.

His current blood pressure is 128 over 72, and his pulse is 88.

11
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,940
It looks like he's still under the effects of the anesthesia.

12
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,880
Live on, kid.

13
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,740
Survive and have a good life.

14
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,140
Oh, Dr. Boyer, how did everything go?

15
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,140
It looks like the procedure went smoothly on your side.

16
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,480
Yes, the surgery went well at least.

17
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,380
The mayor wasn't so lucky.

18
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,880
Really, is that so?

19
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,220
That's very unfortunate news.

20
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,180
You act as though his dying has nothing to do with you.

21
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,200
The truth is, doctor, that you're the one who abandoned our team.

22
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,880
Just before surgery, too.

23
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,040
No, but wait, that child was brought in before the mayor.

24
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,460
What does it matter? Who the hell cares who came in first?

25
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,460
The problem is, you selfishly left us a man short.

26
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,040
We had to scramble to cover for you at the last minute, and somebody died.

27
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,580
Now, wait a minute. Just listen to me. I was...

28
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,180
You upset the teamwork, Dr. Tenma.

29
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,920
You are aware that I followed the director's orders,

30
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,360
and I clearly instructed you to perform that surgery on the mayor, did I not?

31
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,000
However, you chose to ignore that order.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,600
But, doctor, you have to understand, at that time, I...

33
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,280
The process of a surgery depends on the trust among the entire staff.

34
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,260
It's a team effort, and yet you decided to act on your own.

35
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,120
I've already given my report to the director.

36
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,880
He deeply regrets this incident.

37
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,860
This will greatly affect our hospital's reputation.

38
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,120
You have only yourself to blame.

39
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,460
Sir, wait! Please, wait!

40
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,080
Dr. Tenma, things are looking very good.

41
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,240
At the moment, the boy's blood pressure is 114 over 82, pulse 84.

42
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,300
Overall, sir, the boy's vitals are very stable.

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,860
I see. Well, that's good to hear.

44
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,940
Um, I just want to say, sir, the operation was amazing.

45
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,020
After collapsing on a holiday retreat,

46
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,620
Mayor Roediger passed away at the hospital where he was being treated.

47
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,920
As soon as his sudden death was made public,

48
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,640
people began flocking to City Hall with flowers,

49
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,040
many reminiscing on the life of the mayor.

50
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,760
A press conference has been held at Eisler Memorial Hospital

51
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,800
where the mayor was taken.

52
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,720
Mayor Roediger's cause of death was a cerebral infarction

53
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,840
caused by severe infarcts of the inner carotid artery.

54
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,840
We certainly did everything we could for him,

55
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,580
but the condition caused intense swelling of the brain and it resulted in the mayor's untimely

56
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,720
death. As for naming a successor, a city official explained that concrete steps will be taken to

57
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,020
ensure a new mayor is chosen. I've got to get some sleep. We now move on to the murder of Mr. and

58
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,000
Mrs. Liebert, which took place late last night. Judging from clues from the crime scene, police

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,480
believe this might have either been a robbery or a politically motivated terrorist act against the

60
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,340
couple who had recently fled here from the east a full investigation is currently underway

61
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,820
tragically one of the couple's twin children a young boy suffered a gunshot wound to the head

62
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,900
although the surgery was successful the boy has not yet regained consciousness and is still in

63
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:06,740
critical condition now the weather the whole country is in for a clear it's a shame i wonder

64
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,100
what'll end up happening to the boy in a way i'm just like him now

65
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:18,300
Mrs. Reinhardt in ICU is complaining that she's having a hard time sleeping.

66
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,000
That said, do you think we can give her something to help her sleep?

67
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,340
Dr. Tenma, are you listening to me?

68
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,420
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, in that case, give her one Halcyon tablet, please.

69
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,100
That should help her get some sleep.

70
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:43,220
What is with him today? He's been spacing out all day long.

71
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,340
Hey.

72
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,960
Dr. Becker, it's you.

73
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,400
Looks like you're going through a bit of a tough time there.

74
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,420
Come on, fess up. Have you heard anything from the director yet?

75
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,300
Hmm?

76
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,660
I did try to warn you, didn't I?

77
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,400
I told you the hospital is ruled by politics.

78
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,360
I knew what I was talking about.

79
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,340
And if you had played your cards right, I'm sure your future would have been smooth sailing.

80
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,420
Oh, well, I guess what this means is you and I are on the same boat now, my young friend.

81
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,680
Oh, come on, Tenma, don't be so depressed.

82
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,760
I know you'll get a chance to redeem yourself sooner or later.

83
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,580
What do you say we go get some drinks? That'll put a smile on your face.

84
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:36,720
hold on a second nurse excuse me i still need to get a statement from the girl would i be able to

85
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,160
go in and question her now i'm sorry detective this is not a good time huh that girl has

86
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,640
disappeared from her room what did you say

87
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,660
seems like she's always slipping out of her room and wandering all over the hospital

88
00:07:50,660 --> 00:08:02,660
Kill.

89
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,660
Kill.

90
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Kill.

91
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Kill.

92
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:26,140
And so, the reason that Eisler Memorial Hospital has proven to be the nation's leading medical facility is, first and foremost,

93
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,920
because we're blessed to have excellent personnel such as yourselves.

94
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,140
And I'd like to take this opportunity to thank every single one of you for that.

95
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,140
Unfortunately, as you all know, just yesterday, the mayor passed away in our hospital.

96
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,740
Of course, as always, we did our utmost to save his life.

97
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,640
And because of that, this hospital's reputation remains intact.

98
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,020
In appreciation, let's have a round of applause for Dr. Boyer and Dr. Eisen,

99
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,280
who strive to the very end to try and save the mayor's life.

100
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Thank you.

101
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:17,420
I looked over your thesis, young man.

102
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,860
You did an excellent job.

103
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,280
Please keep up the good work, all right?

104
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,020
Excuse me.

105
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:38,700
hmm I I'm so sorry I apologize for what happened sir now now don't worry my boy

106
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,160
what's done is done director you did what you thought was best you followed

107
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,400
your heart why don't we just leave it at that

108
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,100
thank you sir ladies and gentlemen may I have your attention please now a word

109
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,440
from the head of neurosurgery please excuse me it looks like I'm being called

110
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:08,100
up there no you're not tenma allow me to introduce the newly appointed dr boyer please make your way

111
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:16,420
to the microphone but sir what does this mean if you wish to remain at this hospital you may do so

112
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,540
but you'd better give up any dreams of furthering your status it's not possible for irresponsible

113
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:28,180
people such as yourself i recognize your skill as a surgeon but that is it and you

114
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:35,240
can forget about presenting any research papers at future conferences but sir

115
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,240
please listen to me you decide to transfer to another hospital I have no

116
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,860
intention of recommending you in other words it's useless for you to harbor any

117
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,240
ambitions you have successfully tied the noose around your own neck tenma

118
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,480
Successful surgery requires teamwork.

119
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,940
It's only with everyone's help and cooperation that we can hope to save lives.

120
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,920
Ava.

121
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,940
Ava, please, you have to talk to your father for me.

122
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,860
Make him see I haven't done anything wrong. All I did was operate on an emergency patient who was brought in first nothing else

123
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:51,140
Wait is that the engagement ring I gave you spare me Kenzo. You're such a fool

124
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,280
Ava, why?

125
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,640
Dr. Norton, you're looking very handsome this evening.

126
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,740
Oh, thank you.

127
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,520
You're looking especially beautiful tonight yourself, Ava.

128
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:42,100
It's quite ironic, really.

129
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,440
I came to Germany after I discovered one of Director Heinemann's papers,

130
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
and as soon as I get here, he takes me under his wing.

131
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,340
So now it all makes sense.

132
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,440
That paper I was so impressed with,

133
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,840
it was probably written by someone else.

134
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,260
Someone he was grooming, just like he'd been doing with me this whole time.

135
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,780
I knew that he was really just using me.

136
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,260
But I was hoping that when I'd reached a certain status,

137
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,660
I'd be able to make my own choices with what I wanted to work on.

138
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,200
Our priority is to progress as medical scholars before we save lives.

139
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,080
Don't you agree?

140
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,100
That's not true! A doctor's priority is to save whoever he can!

141
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,880
After all, people's lives are not created equal.

142
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,080
Everyone's lives are equal! I don't care what they say!

143
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
I am not wrong. He is!

144
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,480
He tells me there's a flaw in my character.

145
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
Well, what about him?

146
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,480
He says he's a doctor, but he's just a greedy bastard!

147
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,680
Bastard! Bastard!

148
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
He'd be better off dead!

149
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,680
I have to thank you.

150
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,680
I have to thank you because you helped me open up my eyes as a doctor.

151
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
So survive and live a good life.

152
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,680
After all, I did throw away everything in order to save you.

153
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,680
That's how far I went to give you your life back, and I would do it again.

154
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:37,720
You know your name, don't you?

155
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,160
Your name is Anna Liebert, isn't that right?

156
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,080
I did try to warn you that all this was a bit too soon for her, Detective.

157
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,480
Isn't there anything we can do, Doctor?

158
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,360
She saw her parents get shot to death.

159
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,460
She's fine physically, and I think her trauma-induced amnesia is natural, given the circumstances.

160
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,300
Is there any chance you might be able to wait to get a statement from her after she gets better?

161
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,100
Not really. This is a very difficult case.

162
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,120
One of the victims was a former East German diplomat.

163
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,740
If we're not able to solve this quickly, the BKA will be all over our backs.

164
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,920
Those guys always come here after the fact and try and steal the show from us.

165
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,560
I haven't got time to take things easy.

166
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,420
Oh, what if we do this? Yeah, we let her see her brother,

167
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,160
and then she'll probably be so relieved to see him that it might help her regain her memory.

168
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,660
I cannot possibly agree to such a risky proposition. That's completely out of the question.

169
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,020
Besides, I'm sure Dr. Tenma would never permit such a thing.

170
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,840
Tenma?

171
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,080
He's in charge of Johan, her twin brother.

172
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,640
Yeah, sure feels like I'm getting a run around.

173
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:57,700
Hey, Dr. Tenma. You seem a little bit out of it.

174
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,540
You all right?

175
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,100
I mean, you are looking awfully tired this morning.

176
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,100
I've been so busy with emergency surgeries.

177
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,020
Wow, it seems like they've been working you to the bone.

178
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,380
Well, ever since you were demoted from chief.

179
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,200
Well, I don't mind, really.

180
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,040
It actually makes me feel better.

181
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,460
Hmm. How are you really doing, doctor?

182
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,540
I've just been paged. I need to go.

184
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,860
Are you so sure it's a good idea to keep on going like this?

185
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,400
Hard work won't get you anywhere.

186
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,080
Look at this, Dr. Heinemann.

187
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,040
Look at all the gifts and letters of encouragement.

188
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,600
Yes, there are mountains of them in his sister's room as well.

189
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:44,040
The media keeps reporting on the twins' heartbreaking saga after losing their parents

190
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,560
and how they're now on their own.

191
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,240
And this is what we get.

192
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,440
As far as this hospital is concerned, with no one alive to pay their medical expenses, they're nothing but an inconvenience.

193
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,100
Now, now. So their story is a pitiful one. That works for us.

194
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:57,780
Huh?

195
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,980
It only means this hospital is garnering attention.

196
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,920
Think about it a moment, Doctor. These kids are very valuable to us.

197
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,320
Am I right or aren't I?

198
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,140
Uh, yes, sir.

199
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,000
Why don't we do this? We'll give the media a photo of the siblings together.

200
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,940
They'll probably be thrilled to have something like that.

201
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,620
Yes, that's something the media's been requesting for some time now, but the thing is...

202
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,540
Just do it. Don't be naive.

203
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,340
It'll be a picture of the orphaned siblings struggling bravely to survive under the warm-hearted care of our hospital staff.

204
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,040
However, sir, the boy's attending physician says it is still too early to allow them to see each other.

205
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,340
Who's on this case?

206
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,360
It's Dr. Tenma.

207
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Not anymore.

208
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,260
What's that?

209
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,140
There's no need to leave him in a position that's getting so much attention

210
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,580
Just take Dr. Tenma off the case

211
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,920
Yes, sir

212
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:56,900
This is a heartfelt gift from the citizens

213
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,680
Here, why don't you have one?

214
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,900
Thank you

215
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,380
You're looking well, Mrs. Hankel

216
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,420
How do you feel?

217
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,380
I'm feeling quite well, Doctor.

218
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,520
And I owe it all to you.

219
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,040
Thank you.

220
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,140
We'll be removing your stitches very soon,

221
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,120
so it won't be long until you're released.

222
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,600
You mean I'll be able to go home soon?

223
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,560
That's right.

224
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,700
Just make sure you follow my instructions.

225
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,100
All you have to do is rest.

226
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,820
Of course I will, Doctor.

227
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,300
She'll need regular doses of anticonvulsants

228
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,900
and antihypertensives, okay?

229
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,140
Ah!

230
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,640
Anna, wake up!

231
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,260
What happened to her?

232
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:51,200
Dr. Tenma, we brought her in to see her brother and then she just, she just started screaming and...

233
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,360
Why did you do that?

234
00:18:52,360 --> 00:19:03,720
Look, Dr. Tenma

235
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,220
Take her back to her room

236
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,940
Yes, sir

237
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,980
Dr. Boyer, mind telling me what this is about?

238
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,120
And why the camera?

239
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,120
Oh, this?

240
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,580
Well, we wanted to commemorate the emotional meeting of the twins

241
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,540
And then release a picture to the media

242
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,240
Who allowed you to do such a thing?

243
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,500
I should have been consulted

244
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,180
I'm the boy's doctor, damn it

245
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,480
You've been dismissed as the boy's attending physician.

246
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,480
As of today, he's my patient, so I made my own judgment

247
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,480
that it would be fine for the twins to see each other.

248
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Those children!

249
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
You can't turn them into a media circus!

250
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
We were just following the director's orders,

251
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,480
and I think it would be best for you not to fight him!

252
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
I saved this boy's life.

253
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,480
It's my duty to protect him until he fully recovers!

254
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Well, in that case, just take a look.

255
00:19:51,180 --> 00:20:03,900
as soon as he saw his sister he reached out to her and began to cry you see he's regained

256
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,740
consciousness and is reacting normally to stimuli which means the surgery was a great success

257
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:16,140
so good job your work is done here now get back to your post that's an order

258
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:37,140
damn it such idiotic clowns so it was the director's orders don't make me laugh what

259
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:43,080
gives a damn about what the chief says bunch of greedy morons their only motivation is their

260
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,240
Well, that's for power and money.

261
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,380
Screw them!

262
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,180
I'm not wrong, no matter what those bastards think of me.

263
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,220
Hello? Father, I'm home.

264
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,240
Father? Are you in your room?

265
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,800
Huh?

266
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,120
Excuse me, Dr. Boyer. Are you still in a meeting at this time of night?

267
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:55,140
Hello, Father. Are you sleeping already?

268
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,480
I'm coming in.

269
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:23,400
That bastard would...

270
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,680
That bastard would be better off dead.
