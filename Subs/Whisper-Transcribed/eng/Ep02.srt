1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,420
blood pressure 120 over 80 pulse 92 I will begin extracting the bullet

2
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,620
Bullet is extracted.

3
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,380
Removal process is completed.

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,980
It's a little early to be relieved.

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,660
We must still reinforce the walls of the damaged blood vessels.

6
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,960
Uh, right.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,080
Eight-Zero, Proline.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,760
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,600
His current blood pressure is 128 over 72 and his pulse is 88.

10
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,960
It looks like he's still under the effects of the anesthesia.

11
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,860
Live on, kid.

12
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,740
Survive and have a good life.

13
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,140
Oh, Dr. Boyer, how did everything go?

14
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,140
It looks like the procedure went smoothly on your side.

15
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,460
Yes, the surgery went well at least.

16
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,420
I wasn't so lucky.

17
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,880
Really? Is that so?

18
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
That's very unfortunate news.

19
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,180
You act as though his dying has nothing to do with you.

20
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:15,920
Huh?

21
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,220
The truth is, Doctor, that you're the one who abandoned our team.

22
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,860
Just before surgery, too.

23
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,180
No, but wait, that child was brought in before the man--

24
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,440
What does it matter? Who the hell cares who came in first?

25
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,460
The problem is, you selfishly left us a man short.

26
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,800
We had to scramble to cover for you at the last minute

27
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,580
Now, wait a minute. Just listen to me. I was...

28
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,220
You upset the teamwork, Dr. Tenma.

29
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,940
You were aware that I followed the Director's orders,

30
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,360
and I clearly instructed you to perform that surgery on the Mayor, did I not?

31
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,000
However, you chose to ignore that order.

32
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,600
But, Doctor, you have to understand, at that time, I...

33
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,280
The success of a surgery depends on the trust among the entire staff.

34
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,240
It's a team effort, and yet you decided to act on your own.

35
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,120
I've already given my report to the Director.

36
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,440
regrets this incident. This will greatly affect our hospital's reputation. You have only yourself

37
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:24,700
to blame. Sir, wait! Please, wait! Dr. Tenma, things are looking very good. At the moment,

38
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:31,300
the boy's blood pressure is 114 over 82, pulse 84. Overall, sir, the boy's vitals are very stable.

39
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,900
Well, that's good to hear.

40
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,080
Um, I just want to say, sir, the operation was amazing.

41
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,000
After collapsing on a holiday retreat,

42
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,620
Mayor Roediger passed away at the hospital where he was being treated.

43
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,920
As soon as his sudden death was made public,

44
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,640
people began flocking to City Hall with flowers,

45
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,060
many reminiscing on the life of the mayor.

46
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,820
A press conference has been held at Eisler Memorial Hospital, where the mayor was taken.

47
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,740
Mayor Roedeker's cause of death was a cerebral infarction caused by severe amphraxis of the

48
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,820
inner carotid artery.

49
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,840
We certainly did everything we could for him, but the condition caused intense swelling

50
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,980
of the brain, and it resulted in the mayor's untimely death.

51
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,540
As for naming a successor, a city official explained that concrete steps will be taken

52
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,060
to ensure a new mayor is chosen as soon as possible.

53
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,540
I've got to get some sleep.

54
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,060
on to the murder of Mr. and Mrs. Liebert, which took place late last night. Judging

55
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,240
from clues from the crime scene, police believe this might have either been a robbery or a

56
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,380
politically motivated terrorist act against the couple, who had recently fled here from

57
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,320
the East. A full investigation is currently underway.

58
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,520
Tragically, one of the couple's twin children, a young boy, suffered a gunshot wound to the

59
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,740
head. Although the surgery was successful, the boy has not yet regained consciousness

60
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,740
<i>and is still in critical condition.</i>

61
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,660
<i>Now, the weather.</i>

62
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,400
<i>The whole country is in for a clear sunny day...</i>

63
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,340
It's a shame. I wonder what'll end up happening to the boy.

64
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,020
In a way, I'm just like him now.

65
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,620
Mrs. Reinhart in ICU is complaining

66
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,300
that she's having a hard time sleeping.

67
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,240
That said, do you think we can give her something

68
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,000
to help her sleep?

69
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,940
[ Chuckles ]

70
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,380
Dr. Tenma, are you listening to me?

71
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,100
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, in that case, give her one halcyon tablet please. That should help her get some sleep.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,220
What is with him today? He's been spacing out all day long.

73
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,340
Hey.

74
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,960
Dr. Becker, it's you.

75
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,420
Looks like you're going through a bit of a tough time there. Come on, fess up. Have you heard anything from the director yet?

76
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,240
Hmm?

77
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,660
I did try to warn you, didn't I?

78
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,380
I told you the hospital is ruled by politics.

79
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,360
I knew what I was talking about.

80
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,800
And if you had played your cards right,

81
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,340
I'm sure your future would have been smooth sailing.

82
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,080
Ah, well, I guess what this means is

83
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,400
you and I are on the same boat now, my young friend.

84
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,460
Hmm.

85
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,780
Ah, come on, Tenma, don't be so depressed.

86
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,760
I know you'll get a chance to redeem yourself sooner or later.

87
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,780
What do you say we go get some drinks?

88
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,600
That'll put a smile on your face.

89
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,700
- Hold on a second, nurse, excuse me.

90
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,940
I still need to get a statement from the girl.

91
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,920
Would I be able to go in and question her now?

92
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,580
- I'm sorry, detective, this is not a good time.

93
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:40,980
- Huh?

94
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,440
- That girl has disappeared from her room.

95
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,560
- What did you say?

96
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,000
- Seems like she's always slipping out of her room

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,540
and wandering all over the hospital.

98
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,640
- Huh?

99
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,260
And so, the reason that Eisler Memorial Hospital has proven to be the nation's

100
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,520
medical facility is first and foremost because we're blessed to have excellent

101
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,560
personnel such as yourselves and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank

102
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,220
every single one of you for that.

103
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,720
Unfortunately as you all know just yesterday the mayor passed away in our

104
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,760
hospital. Of course as always we did our utmost to save his life and because of

105
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,520
that this hospital's reputation remains intact. In appreciation let's have a

106
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,300
Dr. Boyer and Dr. Eisen, who strive to the very end to try and save the mayor's life.

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,520
[applause]

108
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,800
[chatter]

109
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,280
[laughter]

110
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,720
I looked over your thesis, young man. You did an excellent job. Please keep up the good work.

111
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,280
All right?

112
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,780
I'm so sorry.

113
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,040
I apologize for what happened, sir.

114
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,820
Now, now, don't worry, my boy.

115
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,000
What's done is done.

116
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,140
Director?

117
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,580
You did what you thought was best.

118
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,680
You followed your heart.

119
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,520
Why don't we just leave it at that?

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Thank you, sir.

121
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,280
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?

122
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,460
Now a word from the head of neurosurgery.

123
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,940
Please excuse me. It looks like I'm being called up there.

124
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,780
No, you're not, Tenma.

125
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,100
Allow me to introduce the newly appointed Dr. Boyer.

126
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,780
Please make your way to the microphone.

127
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,360
But, sir, what does this mean?

128
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,420
If you wish to remain at this hospital, you may do so.

129
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,400
But you'd better give up any dreams of furthering your status.

130
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,040
It's not possible for irresponsible people such as yourself.

131
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,840
I recognize your skill as a surgeon, but that is it,

132
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,420
and you can forget about presenting any research papers at future conferences.

133
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,420
But, sir, please listen to me!

134
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,580
And if you decide to transfer to another hospital,

135
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,780
I have no intention of recommending you.

136
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,420
In other words, it's useless for you to harbor any ambitions.

137
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,220
around your own neck, Tenma.

138
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,480
Successful surgery requires teamwork.

139
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,960
It's only with everyone's help and cooperation

140
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,920
that we can hope to save lives.

141
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:26,960
Ava, please, you have to talk to your father for me.

142
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,200
Make him see I haven't done anything wrong.

143
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,060
All I did was operate on an emergency patient who was brought in first, nothing else.

144
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,580
Wait, is that... the engagement ring I gave you?

145
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,220
Spare me, Kenzo.

146
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
You're such a fool.

147
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,300
Ava, why?

148
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,620
Dr. Norton, you're looking very handsome this evening.

149
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,500
Oh, thank you. You're looking especially beautiful tonight yourself, Ava.

150
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,100
It's quite ironic, really.

151
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,400
I came to Germany after I discovered one of Director Heinemann's papers, and as soon

152
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,600
as I get here, he takes me under his wing.

153
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,440
So now it all makes sense, that paper I was so impressed with.

154
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,060
It was probably written by someone else, someone he was grooming, just like he'd been doing

155
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,260
with me this whole time.

156
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,680
I knew that he was really just using me, but I was hoping that when I'd reached a certain

157
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,760
status I'd be able to make my own choices with what I wanted to work on.

158
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,200
Our priority is to progress as medical scholars before we save lives.

159
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,080
Don't you agree?

160
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,320
That's not true!

161
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,080
A doctor's priority is to save whoever he can!

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,840
After all, people's lives are not created equal.

163
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,460
Everyone's lives are equal!

164
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,900
I don't care what they say!

165
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,740
he is he tells me there's a flaw in my character well what about him he says he's a doctor

166
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:53,260
but he's just a greedy bastard bastard bastard he'd be better off dead I have to thank you

167
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,800
I have to thank you because you helped me open up my eyes as a doctor so survive and

168
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,040
Well, I did throw away everything in order to save you.

169
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,080
That's how far I went to give you your life back, and I would do it again.

170
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,100
(dramatic music)

171
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,720
- You know your name, don't you?

172
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,160
Your name is Anna Liebert, isn't that right?

173
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,560
(sighing)

174
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,420
- I did try to warn you that all this

175
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,060
was a bit too soon for her, Detective.

176
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,480
- Isn't there anything we can do, Doctor?

177
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,240
(sighing)

178
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,360
- She saw her parents get shot to death.

179
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,460
And I think her trauma-induced amnesia is natural, given the circumstances.

180
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Is there any chance you might be able to wait to get a statement from her after she gets better?

181
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,100
Not really. This is a very difficult case.

182
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,120
One of the victims was a former East German diplomat.

183
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,740
If we're not able to solve this quickly, the BKA will be all over our backs.

184
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,900
Those guys always come here after the fact and try and steal the show from us.

185
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,560
I haven't got time to take things easy.

186
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:34,140
Oh, what if we do this? Yeah, we let her see her brother and then she'll probably be so relieved to see him that it might help her regain her memory.

187
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,680
I cannot possibly agree to such a risky proposition. That's completely out of the question.

188
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,020
Besides, I'm sure Dr. Tenma would never permit such a thing.

189
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,840
Tenma?

190
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,100
He's in charge of Johan, her twin brother.

191
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,620
Sure feels like I'm getting a run around.

192
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,840
"Hey, Dr. Tenma, you seem a little bit out of it. You all right? I mean, you are looking

193
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,740
awfully tired this morning." "I've been so busy with emergency surgeries."

194
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,700
"Wow, it seems like they've been working you to the bone. Well, ever since you were demoted

195
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,920
from chief." "Well, I don't mind, really. It actually

196
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,940
makes me feel better." "Hmm. How are you really doing, doctor?"

197
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,560
I'm sorry. I've just been paged. I need to go.

198
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,860
Are you so sure it's a good idea to keep on going like this?

199
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,400
Hard work won't get you anywhere.

200
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,080
Look at this, Dr. Heinemann.

201
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,040
Look at all the gifts and letters of encouragement.

202
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,600
Yes, there are mountains of them in his sister's room as well.

203
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,660
The media keeps reporting on the twins' heartbreaking saga

204
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,540
after losing their parents, and how they're now on their own.

205
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,240
And this is what we get.

206
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,500
As far as this hospital is concerned,

207
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,780
with no one alive to pay their medical expenses,

208
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,500
they're nothing but an inconvenience.

209
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,180
Now, now.

210
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,020
So their story is a pitiful one.

211
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
That works for us.

212
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,980
It only means this hospital is garnering attention.

213
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,720
Think about it a moment, doctor.

214
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,920
These kids are very valuable to us.

215
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,320
Am I right, or aren't I?

216
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,160
Yes, sir.

217
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,080
Why don't we do this?

218
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,540
We'll give the media a photo of the siblings

219
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,960
together. They'll probably be thrilled to have something like that.

220
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,640
Yes, that's something the media's been requesting for some time now. But the thing is...

221
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,980
Just do it. Don't be naive. It'll be a picture of the orphaned siblings struggling bravely

222
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,340
to survive under the warm-hearted care of our hospital staff.

223
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,320
However, sir, the boy's attending physician says it is still too early to allow them to

224
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,040
see each other.

225
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,360
Who's on this case?

226
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,380
It's Dr. Tenma.

227
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,700
Not anymore.

228
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,260
What's that?

229
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,140
There's no need to leave him in a position that's getting so much attention.

230
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,560
Just take Dr. Tenma off the case.

231
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,840
Yes, sir.

232
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,800
This is a heartfelt gift from the citizens.

233
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,680
Here, why don't you have one?

234
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,900
Thank you.

235
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,380
You're looking well, Mrs. Hankel.

236
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,420
How do you feel?

237
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,980
- Well, Doctor, and I owe it all to you, thank you.

238
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,140
- We'll be removing your stitches very soon,

239
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,120
so it won't be long until you're released.

240
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,620
- You mean I'll be able to go home soon?

241
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,540
- That's right.

242
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,740
Just make sure you follow my instructions.

243
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
All you have to do is rest.

244
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,800
- Of course I will, Doctor.

245
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,300
- You shall need regular doses of anti-convulsants

246
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,900
and anti-hypertensives, okay?

247
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,440
(Anna screams)

248
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,620
- Anna, wake up!

249
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,520
- What happened to her? - Dr. Tenma!

250
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,280
We brought her in to see her brother, and then she just...

251
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,340
- She just started screaming, and... - Why did you do that?

252
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,200
- But Dr. Tenma... - Take her back to her room.

253
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,120
- Yes, sir. - Dr. Boyer, mind telling me what this is about and why the camera?

254
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:16,520
Oh, this? Well, we wanted to commemorate the emotional meeting of the twins and then release a picture to the media.

255
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,180
Who allowed you to do such a thing? I should have been consulted. I'm the boy's doctor, damn it!

256
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,240
You've been dismissed as the boy's attending physician.

257
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,260
As of today, he's my patient, so I made my own judgment that it would be fine for the twins to see each other.

258
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,700
Those children! You can't turn them into a media circus!

259
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,080
Director's orders, and I think it would be best for you not to fight him. I saved this boy's life

260
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,240
It's my duty to protect him until he fully recovers. Well on that case. Just take a look

261
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,900
As soon as he saw his sister he reached out to her and began to cry you see he's regained

Consciousness and is reacting normally to stimuli which means the surgery was a great success

263
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,420

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,080
Now get back to your post. That's an order.

Dammit! Such idiotic clowns!

266

267

268
