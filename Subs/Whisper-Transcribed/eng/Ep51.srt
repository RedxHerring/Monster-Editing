1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,620
Why are you crying?

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,080
It's just my friend's letter.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,060
My very best friend.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,480
When I was 15, the two of us decided to cross the Czech border together, but my friend was

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,240
captured and she was taken back to Prague.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,240
She says she's doing fine.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,580
She's been such a good friend, she knows me better than my parents do, or even my siblings.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,380
With the government's tough inspections and censorship, who knows what she went through to get this to me.

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,240
She says, "Please visit me if you have the chance. I miss you so much, my friend."

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,520
Near Jeddak Bridge, inside the Three Frogs.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,240
"I want to go back... to Brock."

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,540
- Oh, Margo.

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,200
- Say...

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,980
Just for tonight,

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,160
I want you to call me by my real name.

16
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,540
I am Helenka Novikova.

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,280
For tonight, I'm no longer Margot Langer.

18
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,120
(upbeat music)

19
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,720
I sold my stock holdings in Reiserberger Pharmaceuticals at the right time.

20
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,980
And then, when I bought some stock in Neuter Laboratories, I really hit the jackpot.

21
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,160
Well, I wanted to celebrate, so I did.

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,580
So you had a drink.

23
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,040
Sure, just a little.

24
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,060
That wasn't too smart.

25
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,940
All I had was one drink.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,300
For an alcoholic like yourself, that was a foolish choice you made.

27
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,740
it doesn't matter if you drink a little or a lot.

28
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,600
Another thing that concerns me is it seems you've stopped going to your group meetings as well.

29
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,980
So, um, by the way...

30
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,240
Doctor, you can keep a secret, right?

31
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
I've got this special woman I want you to meet.

32
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,460
Have you gone and found yourself another mistress?

33
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,720
Not really. Look, this one's got a serious issue with alcohol.

34
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,320
She's waiting just outside. Could you see her for a minute?

35
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,600
Have her make an appointment to see me.

36
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,160
- Come on, just see her for a few minutes.

37
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,640
- I'm making a house call next for a very important client.

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,360
I took a few days and went to Prague in the Czech Republic.

39
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,960
I found it a very nice city to visit.

40
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,000
I saw Prague Castle.

41
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,620
Oh, and the wonderful Gothic cathedrals.

42
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,260
It's such a beautiful place when the old town plaza is all lit up.

43
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,020
It's just like a land out of a fairy tale.

44
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,500
- What about Cheddark Bridge?

45
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,580
Did you go and visit the Cheddark Bridge?

46
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,700
- I did, exactly as you told me to do.

47
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,760
Here it is.

48
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,600
See, I took a picture of the sign with the three frogs.

49
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
- And the woman, was she there?

50
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,660
- No, sir, in fact, no one was living there.

51
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,880
Unfortunately, I didn't find any useful information

52
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,200
for you by going there.

53
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,040
It was so frustrating.

54
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,760
and find Tenma, or any good leads on Dieter and Nina.

55
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,660
- Here, take this.

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,960
It's a rabbit's foot.

57
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,800
It's for good luck.

58
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,460
Now listen, please give it to our child after it's born.

59
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,400
Margo, no.

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,560
Helenka, you must know.

61
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,200
I thank you.

62
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,200
Excuse me, ma'am. I've come from Germany, and I'm searching for a missing woman who

63
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,580
might have lived around here a while ago. Do you know a young woman by the name of Margo

64
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,320
Langer? Wait, sorry, her real name was Helenka Novikova.

65
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,800
- (gasps) Helenca.

66
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,500
- Anyway, Mr. Shuvald, your son Carl

67
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,940
recently gave me a call.

68
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,060
He expressed some concerns to me

69
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,420
about the fact that you haven't been eating properly.

70
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,900
I'd classify that experience you had

71
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,680
at the library fire as traumatic.

72
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,080
A near-death experience can change one's life, you know.

73
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,820
I sense that paralyzing fear still hasn't left you,

74
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,360
- I'm very blessed to have Carl here with you.

75
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,280
He's a wonderful, thoughtful, and loving son.

76
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,200
You really have nothing more to worry about.

77
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,220
Please do try to eat regularly, won't you?

78
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,020
- The monster.

79
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,820
- Hmm?

80
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,340
- As long as that monster exists, it's so difficult.

81
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,220
How did he know so much about Margot?

82
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,660
Where could he have obtained all that information?

83
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,180
He knew much more than Carl or I did.

84
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,140
Years ago, Margot told me of this girlfriend she had

85
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,840
who knew her even better than her own siblings or parents.

86
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,880
I remember that conversation.

87
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,620
This was the woman who Margot exchanged letters with.

88
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,560
Now, in the 1980s, you began to search for Margot,

89
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,340
who at that time had gone missing.

90
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,240
You went to Prague and actually met that woman, didn't you?

91
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,120
Considering she was supposed to be Margo's best friend,

92
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,880
I assumed that woman might have heard something from her.

93
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,440
I was wrong.

94
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,520
She said she didn't know where Margo was.

95
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,180
But for a while, we did talk quite a bit about Margo

96
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,640
as we stood in the doorway.

97
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,600
And that's when they were listening.

98
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,640
Listening in on every word.

99
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,920
Who do you mean?

100
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,980
They quietly listened to what we said.

101
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,960
They stood behind the woman, absorbing it all.

102
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,500
Those twins.

103
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,980
(knocking)

104
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,960
- Yes, come in.

105
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,900
Welcome, have a seat.

106
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,500
You're the young lady Mr. Thalbach

107
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,900
wanted me to see, aren't you?

108
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,580
And you're a compulsive drinker.

109
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,060
Please just relax.

110
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,900
Today all we're going to do here

111
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,940
is have ourselves a nice, friendly chat.

112
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,220
- Doctor! - What is it, Merith?

113
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,400
Can't you see I'm right in the middle of a session?

114
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,460
He's on TV! It's Dr. Tenma!

115
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,440
Excuse me for a second.

116
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,840
Repeating our breaking news story,

117
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,440
Czech police have announced that they have recently arrested

118
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,760
and taken into custody Japanese Dr. Kenzo Tenma.

119
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,980
It appears Tenma was discovered

120
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,920
while he was attempting to avoid authorities

121
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,740
by hiding in the city of Prague.

122
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,460
He is a witness and possible suspect

123
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,900
in the poisoning of three doctors

124
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,100
at Dusseldorf's Eisler Memorial Hospital.

125
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,500
He may also be connected with the murders

126
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,620
Fortner couple in Heidelberg, and the phantom killing at Heidelberg Castle.

127
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,120
For now, these are all the details we have.

128
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,640
Tenma.

129
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,600
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. You're not really allowed in here.

130
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,320
Could you wait outside?

131
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,000
Uh, Ms. Heinemann?

132
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,520
Kenzo.

133
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,260
I'm sorry for being late, everyone.

134
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,140
Why, Mr. Hess, you look ten years younger.

135
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,080
Playing with my grandchildren is keeping me young.

136
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,360
Huber, how you been?

137
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,220
I'm actually finishing up my final academic year.

138
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,620
I hear you're pretty busy too, Mr. Kiefer.

139
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,040
I was bragging about you, saying how I'm friends with a screenwriter.

140
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,480
Who's going to Hollywood?

141
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,880
I just happened to catch the eye of a producer who has a big imagination.

142
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,940
My first story idea's in development, and my mind's brimming with new plot lines.

143
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,240
You're on your way!

144
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,740
You know, that surgery saved my life.

145
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,340
If my surgery hadn't been a success, I wouldn't be here to hear your laughter, thanks to him.

146
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,360
And I never would have walked in the park with my grandchildren. Think of that. Right there.

147
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,700
He always sat over there by himself, drinking his tea.

148
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:26,860
Other doctors went to nicer cafes, but he came here because it was closest to Eisler Memorial Hospital.

149
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,860
And when we patients would come in here...

150
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,600
He would look at us as he sat there.

151
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,280
And smile at us and wave.

152
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,860
He was the kindest doctor.

153
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,920
Yes.

154
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,240
A great doctor like him.

155
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,040
He would never do this.

156
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,460
No!

157
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,980
And that's the reason why I've gathered all of us here today.

158
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,220
The others who aren't here said they feel the same as we do.

159
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,020
After all, they were Dr. Tenma's patients too.

160
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,040
Bad news, Dr. Schumann!

161
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,720
Mr. Merkel just collapsed, sir!

162
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,360
I'll be right over.

163
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,100
But I'm busy at the moment.

164
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,560
You better go and wait for me there.

165
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,240
All right.

166
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,540
Really? Dr. Temma wouldn't do those things.

167
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,300
Calm down and listen to me, Mom.

168
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,980
Please, dear, go to him quickly.

169
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,720
But, Petra, I can't just...

170
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,320
Don't you give me any buts!

171
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,580
Dr. Temma has been charged with a crime he didn't commit!

172
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,640
If he hadn't been around, you know I wouldn't be alive right now.

173
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,440
My dear Dr. Shuman,

174
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,500
are you so heartless that you don't want to help the man who saved your wife's life?

175
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,360
Then what will happen here?

176
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,340
You know darn well I'm the only doctor in this village.

177
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,920
What'll happen to everyone that lives around here if I go and leave town?

178
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,600
You want to go, don't you?

179
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,900
Quit your blabbering and get going right now!

180
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,520
Dr. Temma needs your help!

181
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,840
I took an oath, and if there's a patient who needs me, I can't just leave him.

182
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,020
That's the way Dr. Tenma would have behaved.

183
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,120
Please, doctor, would you see us now?

184
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,980
Be patient. I need a little more time.

185
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,360
Well, hurry up!

186
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,720
Stop your whining. The doctor's taking a big risk by practicing without a license while she's going to school.

187
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,740
"When you're in the darkness, you only sink deeper into it.

188
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,800
Keep the light shining.

189
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,320
You've got a real gift for this.

190
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,760
You'll make a fine doctor."

191
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,740
"Dr. Tenma..."

192
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,640
All right, I'm ready to start now.

193
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,600
Whoever's first, come in.

194
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,380
Get a lawyer.

195
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Right, but Father, wait.

196
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,360
We still have no way of knowing exactly where in Germany Tenma will be sent.

197
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,060
Then we'll have to retain a lawyer that can defend him in any of the German states.

198
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,420
Get us the best criminal attorney you can.

199
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,300
Yes, sir.

200
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,520
We must help Tenma.

201
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,220
Yet he is the only one who can do it.

202
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,640
He's the only one who can get rid of the monster.

203
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
- We need strength in numbers.

204
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,040
- Well, let's try calling in more

205
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,620
of Dr. Tenma's former patients.

206
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,760
- As individuals, what we say may not matter much,

207
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,260
but as a group, we might just--

208
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:31,760
- That's right.

209
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,580
Let's ask Eisler Memorial Hospital

210
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,980
for help in getting organized,

211
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,760
and we could ask them for funding, too.

212
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,360
- Forget it.

213
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,900
That's impossible.

214
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,300
Eisler Memorial Hospital is not about to help you with something like that.

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hey, I've been listening to all of you, and it's quite a touching story.

216
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,460
Really?

217
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,320
But come on, folks. Be realistic about the situation.

218
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,900
How's the Dr. Tenma fan club going to prove his innocence?

219
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,180
Oh, Dr. Becker, it's you.

220
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,440
You know Tenma had no alibi, and unfortunately, he did have a motive.

221
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,900
The police even came out and said they found physical evidence at the scene of the crime.

222
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,000
Even if you hire a brilliant lawyer to defend him,

223
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,840
and you gather a ton of people to make a lot of noise,

224
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,560
it's not going to help.

225
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,920
No matter what you folks do on Dr. Tenma's behalf,

226
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
it's impossible to prove that he's innocent.

227
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,800
Anyway, it's a real shame about his career.

228
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,240
Yeah, it's a real shame.

229
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,220
I'm going to ask you again.

230
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,680
Eva, what's your relationship to Tenma?

231
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,480
Look, Miss Heinemann. I don't know who you are in all of this.

232
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,940
But I'm on this train because I mean to save Dr. Tenma.

233
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,040
So I don't want you coming along if you're here just to do some sightseeing.

234
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,240
Eva Heinemann?

235
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Heinemann! Miss Heinemann!

236
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,740
Are you the daughter of Dr. Heinemann, the murder director of that hospital in Dusseldorf?

237
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,620
Dr. Tenma. He had quite an effect on me. You see, he destroyed my life.

238
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,180
And yet, I'm the only one who can really save him now.

239
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,300
I saw.

240
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,740
Saw what?

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,120
Dr. Kenzo Tenma, prime suspect in the serial murders in Dusseldorf and Heidelberg, is still in custody in Prague.

242
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,960
However, officials have said he will be extradited to Germany as soon as possible.

243
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,160
He will most likely be sent to Dusseldorf where the first murder occurred.

244
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,360
No way. That isn't possible. That's him.

245
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,720
But that doctor couldn't have...

246
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,420
This is Dr. Tenma. He's the one who saved your life, Suk.

247
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,200
You're alive right now because of his first aid treatment. It turns out. Dr. Tenma has also been framed for a crime

248
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,780
He never committed. I guess you two are in the same situation, huh?

249
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,920
Tenma saved my life. He's going through the same ordeal as me

250
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,200
You're a detective, aren't you? Act like it. You have to calmly dissect and scrutinize everything

251
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,160
There is really only one way to prevent yourself from being betrayed

252
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,800
All you have to do is doubt the person you believe in the most.

253
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,060
I've got to go.

254
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,640
I've got to get to the Prague police station and talk to Tenma no matter what it takes.

255
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,320
There you are, Suk.

256
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,320
Well then.

257
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,620
Detective Brozek.

258
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,380
Detective Stransky.

259
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,220
Please, listen to me!

260
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,900
You don't have to run away anymore.

261
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,440
My God, you must have gone through a lot.

262
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,640
You've been exonerated, Suk.

263
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,320
A letter was sent to the station.

264
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,140
This is a copy of it.

265
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,780
A letter?

266
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,800
It's a handwritten confession.

267
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,060
It has details of the events that only the killer would know.

268
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,680
So, you've been cleared of all suspicion.

269
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,840
So, who sent that letter?

270
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,280
A journalist who goes by the name of Grimmer.

271
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,920
Yeah, Grammer's been put on our most-wanted list.

272
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,580
He's now our chief suspect.

273
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,680
Wait, just hold on a second.

274
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,820
Relax, Zouk. You're in the clear.

275
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,140
Inspector Zaymont's murder, the head chief's poisoning,

276
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,480
and the shooting of the two special team members

277
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,200
that had tailed you back to your apartment.

278
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,580
All those crimes are now solved.

279
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,960
(suspenseful music)

280
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,280
(phone ringing)

281
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,600
(suspenseful music)

282
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,160
- Bungie, where have you been?

283
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,800
I've been trying to get a hold of you.

284
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,280
Well, Chief, I was doing some sightseeing.

285
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,000
Give me a break. Don't act like I'm stupid.

286
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,680
Stupid? What are you talking about?

287
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,800
Quit the act. Don't tell me you haven't heard the news.

288
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,900
Oh. Are you talking about Dr. Tenma's arrest?

289
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,420
Ha ha. Congratulations, Lungay.

290
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:16,800
Huh?

291
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,020
You knew it, didn't you? You knew Tenma was hiding out in Prague.

292
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,300
Good work, Lungay. Your persistence in this investigation really paid off.

293
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,460
I just finished talking with the Czech police and they gave me all the details about what they're gonna do with Tenma

294
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,500
Tenma will be arriving in Dusseldorf tomorrow at 2 p.m. Since you're in charge of this case

295
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,160
You'll need to meet the Czech police to take him into custody

296
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,340
Anyway good work Lunga

297
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,660
Congratulations

298
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,520
Dispatch someone else to take care of it. What did you say Prague is a very nice place what?

299
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,900
Please understand sir right now

300
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,800
I'm still on vacation.

301
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,360
Hey, Lungi! What are you talking about? Listen!

302
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,560
Now let me see Dr. Tenma.

303
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,160
As I've been telling you, sir, you cannot see him.

304
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,380
And why not? I thought this country is supposed to be a democracy.

305
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,320
Dr. Tenma is already in the process of being extradited to Germany.

306
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,320
I just need to see him for a minute.

307
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,960
We came all that way for nothing.

308
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,020
All that time and effort, what a stupid waste.

309
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,220
Let me see him! I'm begging you!

310
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,380
On your feet.

311
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,620
Come with us.

312
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,440
When we interrogate people,

313
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,480
what type of person do you think gives us the hardest time?

314
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,160
People who remain expressionless no matter what we say to them.

315
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,760
People who don't say anything at all.

316
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,460
That's the hardest kind.

317
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,540
A love letter from the monster to the beauty.

318
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,860
This appears to be a draft for a novel.

319
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:30,680
"I've been watching you. I wanted to devour you whole, but instead everything about you

320
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:39,660
consumed me. When I was falling apart, how did I look to you? When I was falling apart,

321
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:47,560
the object you gave me, you left me a beautiful jewel, those twins who look as if they are

322
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,020
blessed with eternal life.

323
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,380
The most sinful deed is to take away a person's name.

324
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,740
Let's get your name back.

325
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,580
I'll give you your name back.

326
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,280
Your name is Anna.

327
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:11,320
Right now, I'm sad, sad, sad, sad.

328
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,420
It exists.

329
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,940
There are many people that met their end in that room.

330
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,800
And then, a horrific monster was born.

331
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,740
[MUSIC]

332
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,440
