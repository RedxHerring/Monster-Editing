40
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:04,520
luck with that one. Oh, hey there, Dr. Schumann. So how's Fink doing? Looks like he's going to

41
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,400
pull through. I'm more worried about the bottle doing him in. And you are? Who am I?

42
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,540
Dr. Chan. We're alumni from the same medical school. He figured he'd drop by the village

43
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,720
while he's on vacation.

44
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,320
Dr. Chan, huh?

45
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,220
Have you and I met somewhere before?

46
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
He took care of Fink, actually,

47
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,960
since I was out making house calls.

48
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,720
Good thing he was here, yes, sir.

49
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,640
Speaking of house calls, guess where I went again today?

50
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,200
Where?

51
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,640
Heinz, isn't it obvious?

52
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,380
I'm talking about your mother, Petra.

53
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,120
My mother?

54
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,260
You need to tell her to come down to the clinic right away.

55
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,560
There's no telling what may be wrong with her

56
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,540
without a checkup.

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,700
There's no way.

58
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,920
She's too stubborn.

59
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,080
Come on, you know that woman won't listen to anybody.

60
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,480
She's your mother. Stop acting so flip.

61
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,440
Don't worry, Doc. Trust me, Mom's not gonna die that easily.

62
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,040
What?

63
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,280
Besides, she raised me, so what's left to do?

64
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,980
When it's time, she won't have any regrets.

65
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,300
What did you say? Fight your tongue!

66
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,780
Petra has plenty of living to do, do you hear me?

67
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,720
Why did you lie to him?

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,320
Hmm? Because I never would have made it to Fink in time.

69
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,600
No, he'd be dead right now if you hadn't stepped in like you did.

70
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,980
Thank you very much, sir.

71
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,400
You turned white as a sheet when you saw Hines. How come?

72
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,480
Never mind. At least now I know you're not some hotshot doctor from the city.

73
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,280
I'm in your debt, sir. I really do mean it. I don't know how I can ever pay you back.

74
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,040
Is that so? Hop in the car. I've got an idea.

75
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,780
Your splint is misaligned. I'll straighten it.

76
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,640
This may hurt a bit, but just hang in there.

77
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,540
There you go. That should do the trick.

78
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,180
Don't let me catch you not wearing that in the next two weeks.

79
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,960
Hey, Doc, I made some smooth apple wine.

80
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,240
how about we drink to my new cast I think that's an awful idea but I'll have

81
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,980
a drink with you when the cast comes off

82
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:28,080
you should be fine five days and you can go back to the fields good news huh mr.

83
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,200
Shona doctor why don't you take some potatoes we had a good crop this year

84
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:40,340
I'll remember that offer when I come back some afternoon with a truck thanks

85
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,020
Thanks for the help. My specialty's internal medicine, but I have to be a jack-of-all-trades

86
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,280
out here. I'm all the doctoring these folks get, and there's only one of me.

87
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
It's wonderful.

88
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,100
Yeah, tranquility's the one thing this place has in spate.

89
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:01,880
No, I didn't mean the land. I mean how much you love all the people in this village. And

90
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,660
at the same time, how much they all seem to love you back.

91
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,660
Hm. Love, huh?

92
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,660
That ship sailed a long time ago.

93
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,660
This is my job, and that's why I do it.

94
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Well, one last stop, and you're a free man.

95
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I saved the best for last.

96
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
You just don't quit, do you?

97
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,660
Quit? I don't even know the meaning of the word.

98
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,660
And it'll be the same thing no matter how many times you come back.

99
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,660
Just leave, you quack.

100
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:41,300
like I'm talking to a mule Petra's the mother of that officer who had you spooked she collapsed

101
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,160
three days ago working in the fields I talked her into coming down to the clinic but she changed

102
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,720
her mind on the way over she's been holed up in there ever since that is worrisome not to

103
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,500
butt in but do you mind if I try talking to her it's not gonna make a lick of difference

104
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,140
Don't tell me you're still standing out there, you idiot!

105
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,800
I'll stand wherever I damn well want to, woman!

106
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,160
Doctor, please, you have to calm down.

107
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,660
She'll never come out if you keep yelling at her like that.

108
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,660
You're getting a checkup, and that's final!

109
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm not going to stand the possibility of losing you!

110
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,020
Huh?

111
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,340
What I mean is, I wouldn't have anyone to fight with anymore.

112
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,740
Also, I wouldn't be able to eat that goulash of hers if that stubborn old thing passed on.

113
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,380
Hey, mister, how come your face is red?

114
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,120
What did you say, you little brat?

115
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,780
Please, Miss Petra, open the door.

116
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,420
Another doctor? Are you kidding me?

117
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,240
What did I say? It's a waste of time.

118
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
So tell me, why do you hate doctors?

119
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,700
Why do I hate doctors?

120
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,060
I'll tell you why.

121
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,500
You play God with people's lives. That's why.

122
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,920
God? Don't I wish.

123
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,680
Sometimes I think it would be great if we were.

124
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,140
We try our best, but we make mistakes, too.

125
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,800
Wouldn't it be great if doctors could be perfect like God and just heal people?

126
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,400
When I see my patients, it's always the same.

127
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
On the inside, I'm trembling like a leaf.

128
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,860
Please, Miss Petra, let me at least see you.

129
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,860
Huh?

130
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:36,340
Hmm? What is it I'm smelling?

131
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,080
You're cooking up some goulash in here, aren't you?

132
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,740
Why are you asking? You like goulash or something?

133
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,580
I do, but it seems that Dr. Schumann is a particularly big fan of it.

134
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,020
At least that's what he told me, anyway.

135
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,560
Well, that's news to me.

136
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,020
I always make it for him and he eats it, but he never says a word.

137
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,560
He's very shy.

138
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,920
this looks really delicious my shoulders are so stiff and I still have a lot of

139
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,880
food to prepare for tonight's dinner stiff shoulders miss Petra can you touch

146
00:11:49,940 --> 00:12:00,880

If you can't, then my failings will have lost me

150
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,720
the woman I love for a second time.

151
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,900
- Are you sure that it's Kenzo Tenma?

152
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,780
- Positive.

153
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,460
- All right, he probably hasn't gone far.

154
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,340
Set up checkpoints along the highway.

155
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,280
If we catch this guy, it'll be big, Hines.

156
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,460
- Yes, sir.

157
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,560
- Prepare for emergency deployment.

158
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,540
This is great. If things go well, I'll get promoted.

159
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,540
Hey, Hines. You have a call.

160
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,760
This is Hines speaking.

161
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,280
Oh? The nurse from the clinic?

162
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,500
What? Are you kidding me? My mother collapsed again?

163
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,600
God, why didn't I drag her into town?

164
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,700
If they had checked her at the state hospital, it wouldn't have come to this.

165
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,980
Dr. Tenma, you're the only one who can save her.

166
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,280
Just as I suspected. It's an aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery.

167
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,660
Damn it. We don't even have a surgical microscope or a craniotome here.

168
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,780
I can still do it, as long as I have an aneurysm clip.

169
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,520
No, it's too difficult, even for someone of your caliber.

170
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,640
We've got no other option here.

171
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,480
If the aneurysm ruptures, I'm afraid she's not going to survive the night.

172
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,560
It's my fault this is happening again.

173
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,000
What are you talking about, Dr. Schumann?

174
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,120
Those aren't the words of a man who's single-handedly taken care of this entire town.

175
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,520
I don't know what happened in the past, but you have to do the best job you can do right now.

176
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,760
That's all we as doctors can do.

177
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,420
Yeah.

178
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,340
Hey, kid. Dr. Schumann's inside, isn't he?

179
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,120
Mm-hmm. He's operating right now.

180
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,660
What do you mean, he's operating?

181
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,440
Why are they doing it here at this clinic instead of taking her to the hospital in town?

182
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,960
Hey, don't worry. Tenma's in there helping.

183
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,480
Tenma's in there?

184
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,560
How's her blood pressure and pulse?

185
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,380
Blood pressure holding steady at 126 over 84.

186
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,160
Her pulse is 88.

187
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,320
Amazing. He's so fast and efficient, even without the benefit of a craniotome.

188
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,700
What the hell are you doing?

189
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,600
We're operating on your mother. Isn't that obvious?

190
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,220
What are you doing with that gun?

191
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,140
Put your hands up, Tenma! Do it!

192
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,700
If he stops now, she'll die. Is that what you want?

193
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,980
He's the one trying to kill her. Tenma is wanted for murder.

194
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,140
He's a suspect in several killings.

195
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:54,920
What?

196
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,380
He killed a man in Heidelberg.

197
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,900
And he's the prime suspect in the serial murders of those couples.

198
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,020
Who would have thought that I'd find you here?

199
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,840
Leave it to good old Mom, always looking for new ways to help out her boy.

200
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,920
Now put your hands up, Tenma! If you don't, I'll shoot!

201
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,260
Like hell you will!

202
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,940
This is a sterile operating room, or it was until you came barging in.

203
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,200
Do you want your mother to die of meningitis?

204
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,060
Because it's very likely to happen if you keep standing there!

205
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,420
Then... then stop the operation!

206
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,200
She's going to die, Hines. Don't you get it?

207
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,260
There's a subarachnoid hemorrhage in your mother's brain,

208
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,760
And she's had it for three entire days.

209
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,960
If we don't save her now, she dies.

210
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,980
Now get out of here, Heinz!

211
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,060
No way! I'm onto you, Tenma!

212
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,800
You're just planning on using my mom as a hostage so you can run away from here!

213
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,580
All right, nurse. Aneurysm clip and forceps, please.

214
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,200
Aneurysm clip and forceps, now!

215
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,460
Yes!

216
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,300
That's my mother on that table! I won't let anyone hurt her!

217
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,980
Yes, Petra's your mother, and you're her son.

218
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,620
But what kind of son have you been to her these past five years?

219
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,760
I know you didn't visit her once since you left for the city.

220
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,520
She sacrificed a lot for you, and what have you done for her in return?

221
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,400
Anything?

222
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,260
Listen, son, the folks we love can be gone in an instant.

223
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,240
Do you remember what your mother's goulash tastes like?

224
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,080
Even now, years later, Petra sets out a dish for you.

225
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,040
I should know. I'm the one who eats it.

226
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,880
Remember how delicious it is?

227
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,120
Dr. Tenma is fighting to save your mother.

228
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,420
He's giving it everything he's got.

229
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,820
So if you ever want to taste that goulash again, you'll get out of here now!

230
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,880
See? Tenma's there, so it's okay.

231
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:58,980
Blood pressure 140 over 86, pulse 82

232
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,960
Good, her vital signs have stabilized

233
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,260
Why don't you get some rest, Miss Pionier?

234
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,060
Doctor, you've been up all day

235
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,860
What, like you haven't? I'll be just fine

236
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,480
Yes, sir

237
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,620
You did well today

238
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,780
Doctor Tenma, you should get some rest too

239
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,860
Don't worry about me, I'm fine

240
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,200
You're fine, that was a grueling operation

241
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,680
You must be dead on your feet.

242
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,020
I want to stay and make sure she pulls through.

243
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,640
That way, when Miss Petra has recovered enough,

244
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,860
you can go ahead and finally propose to her.

245
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,960
What do you mean, propose?

246
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:31,900
Huh?

247
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,920
Hey, I thought you were supposed to be asleep.

248
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,560
I'm not sleeping.

249
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,180
Not until I take him down to this station.

250
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,580
What's he talking about, anyway?

251
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,560
You're not thinking about marrying my mom, are you?

252
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,860
Of course not.

253
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,500
Don't be stupid.

254
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,300
Even if I did, I'm not the kind of man who's worthy of proposing to anyone.

255
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,240
I used to work at the university hospital.

256
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,020
Didn't give a damn about any of my patients.

257
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,180
All I cared about was moving up the ladder faster than the next guy.

258
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,820
I got in good with the director and ended up writing all his research papers for him.

259
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,440
Would you believe it? Even married the boss's daughter. What a cliche.

260
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,580
Oh, I moved up that damn ladder, all right,

261
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,220
and ignored her like the rung she was.

262
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,180
If only I had been a real doctor

263
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,160
or shown her the least bit of attention,

264
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,420
I'd have known in a moment.

265
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,160
Huh?

266
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,740
My wife came down with a simple cold.

267
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,800
At least that's what I wrote it off as.

268
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,120
If only I had looked at her, I would have seen it.

269
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,080
An intern would have seen it.

270
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,840
Severe liver failure.

271
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,780
Before she died, she said,

272
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,880
I finally have your undivided attention.

273
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,400
I don't deserve to love anybody after what I did to that poor woman.

274
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,440
That's not true.

275
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,580
You have been paying attention, Doctor.

276
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,320
You've been watching over the people of this village.

277
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,040
Petra is going to survive this because you were watching.

278
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:23,420
Do you still plan on taking this man to jail?

279
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,620
He did everything in his power last night to save your mother's life.

280
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,460
What kind of murderer would do that?

281
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,700
Hines!

282
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,660
This is Hines. Get me the chief.

283
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,300
Chief.

284
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,880
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

285
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,520
We should cancel this search.

286
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,280
The man I saw before was not Tenma.

287
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,960
He was another doctor by the name of Chan.

288
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,840
I thought it was him because he was Asian.

289
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,260
Yes, that's right.

290
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,300
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.

291
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,940
The doctor from the state hospital sure did seem surprised.

292
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,400
Well, of course he did.

293
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,100
He probably never expected to see such amazing results from a little clinic in the boonies.

294
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,440
Dr. Schumann!

295
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,760
Are you really going to let that young doctor leave?

296
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,420
I was making him something to eat, but he packed his bags and left with the kid.

297
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,260
Tenma!

298
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,180
Don't go! This town is safe for you. There's no need to run away.

299
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,200
Dr. Schumann, what are you...

300
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,020
Dieter! This is a nice village, isn't it?

301
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,060
You're right. This village may be a very good place for a boy like Dieter here.

302
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,820
Yes, but not only for him. You could stop running. You'll be off the radar if you stay.

303
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,420
The folks in this village need more than I can give them on my own.

304
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,960
Together, there's no end to the good we could do.

305
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,340
I can't. I'm sorry, but I really have to be moving on.

306
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,220
But why?

307
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,520
Take care of Dieter. He's better off here.

308
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,560
Tenma, wait! I'm going with you!

309
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,940
Wait, Dr. Tenma! Please, think of the countless lives you could save if you stay!

310
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,260
What's more important than that?

311
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,200
Save countless lives.

312
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,500
Before I do that, there's a man whose life I have to end.

313
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,200
What? What are you...

314
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,400
Tenma!

315
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,720
You can't mean that! No!

316
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,760
Dammit, you're a good man, Tenma!

317
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,460
You fought like hell to save Petra's life.

318
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,660
Why? You're not a killer!

319
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,640
It's no use.

320
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,480
Tenma's gonna go no matter what you say to him.

321
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,820
Go take care of him, Dieter.

322
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,180
If you stay with Tenma,

323
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,620
maybe you can keep him from going down the wrong path.

324
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,020
Go with him and look after him.
