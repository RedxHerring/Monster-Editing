1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,700
Petra! You're going in for a check-up, and that's final!

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,300
I told you to stop wasting your time coming here!

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,160
Yeah, well, if you'd open the damn door right now, it wouldn't be a waste of my time!

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,680
Nobody asked you to butt in!

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,220
You're as stubborn as an old mule, you know that?!

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,880
Look who's talking, you quack!

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,080
I've never been to a doctor in my entire life, and I'm a healthy woman!

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,380
A very healthy woman, as a matter of fact!

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,940
Now, leave me alone!

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:29,980
Oh, no!

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,180
by you? Doctor! We got a problem! Dr. Schumann! Yes, what is it? It's a drunk, think! He

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,520
got hit by a car out on the highway! What? When you left him, was he still awake? I'm

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,580
not sure, but some guy was treating him when I left. Huh? Somebody who just happened to

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,400
be passing by, I guess. Some passerby?

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,820
So, mind telling me what happened here?

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,860
I told him you were out doing house calls,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,020
but that man insisted.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,800
Oh, he insisted, did he?

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,020
I'm so sorry.

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,380
I tried to stop him,

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,600
but he said he needed to take emergency measures

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,540
because the patient might choke to death.

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,380
Hmm.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,660
Well, who did he say he was?

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
I don't know.

26
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,260
He never did tell me his name.

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,360
Oh, he did write something on the chart, though.

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,420
Hmm the patient kept pleading with me not to bring him to this clinic because he said he had no money to pay for a

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:36,800
doctor

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,080
Please take this to cover any medical expenses

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,640
Bastard, who does he think he is?

32
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,980
Doctor, where are you going? This fellow? What did he look like?

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,680
He was an Asian man, and he had a little boy with him

34
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,760
Doctor what about mr. Fink? There's nothing more I can do for him

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,260
But that man only took emergency measures to prevent choking.

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,740
Yeah, emergency measures my eyes.

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,700
That stranger patched him up perfectly.

38
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,380
[MUSIC]

39
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,760
[MUSIC]

40
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,540
Listen, Dieter, you can't keep following me around like this.

41
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,680
It isn't going to work.

42
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,180
I can never stay in just one place.

43
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,080
And you can't go to school like this.

44
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,180
You won't make any friends.

45
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,380
I have a friend.

46
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,860
And who is that?

47
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,040
It's you.

48
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,700
That isn't what I meant.

49
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,240
Was it you?

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,320
Huh?

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,140
Well, were you the one showing me up in my own clinic?

52
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,460
Keep your damn money. Maybe I'm just a country doctor, but I take care of my own

53
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,200
I would never stoop so low as to charge that poor drunkard for treatment

54
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,440
Sir, I just you're probably some big-city doctor out on vacation

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,280
I bet you're pleased as punch. You got to go show us yokel some charity

56
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,300
Hey, how's it going? Come on Dieter? Let's go

57
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,140
Don't you know it wait up?

58
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,520
- I'm not finished with you yet.

59
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,740
- I'm terribly sorry.

60
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,480
We're in a hurry, we have to get going now.

61
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,380
- Hmm, Fink got injured in a hit and run.

62
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,660
- Oh, you mean that guy who drinks too much?

63
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:49,980
- Yeah.

64
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,100
We're looking for any witnesses.

65
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,580
- Yikes, good luck with that one.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,700
- Oh, hey there, Dr. Shuman.

67
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,340
So how's Fink doing?

68
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,020
- Looks like he's going to pull through.

69
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,380
I'm more worried about the bottle doing him in.

70
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,240
- Hmm.

71
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,340
- Uh, who am I? - Hmm?

72
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,640
- Dr. Chan.

73
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,780
We're alumni from the same medical school.

74
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,700
He figured he'd drop by the village while he's on vacation.

75
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,320
- Dr. Chan, huh?

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,220
Have you and I met somewhere before?

77
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,180
- He took care of Fink, actually,

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,960
since I was out making house calls.

79
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,720
Good thing he was here, yes, sir.

80
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,640
Speaking of house calls, guess where I went again today?

81
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,640
- Where? - Heinz, isn't it obvious?

82
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,380
I'm talking about your mother, Petra.

83
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,140
my mother you need to tell her to come down to the clinic right away there's no

84
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,340
telling what may be wrong with her without a checkup there's no way she's

85
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,820
too stubborn come on you know that woman won't listen to anybody she's your

86
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,100
mother stop acting so flip don't worry doc trust me mom's not gonna die that

87
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,960
easily what besides she raised me so what's left to do when it's time she

88
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,520
won't have any regrets what did you say bite your tongue Petra has plenty of

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,020
(car door slams)

90
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,720
- Why did you lie to him?

91
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:15,840
- Hmm?

92
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,300
Because I never would have made it to Fink in time.

93
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,580
No, he'd be dead right now

94
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,580
if you hadn't stepped in like you did.

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
- Thank you very much, sir.

96
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,560
- You turned white as a sheet when you saw Heinz.

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,400
How come?

98
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,100
Nevermind.

99
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,780
Least now I know you're not some hotshot doctor

100
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,460
from the city.

101
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,320
I'm in your debt, sir. I really do mean it. I don't know how I can ever pay you back

102
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Is that so hop in the car? I've got an idea

103
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,620
Your splint is misaligned I'll straighten it this may hurt a bit but just hang in there

104
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,500
There you go, that should do the trick

105
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,220
Don't let me catch you not wearing that in the next two weeks.

106
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,040
Hey, Doc, I made some smooth apple wine, how about we drink to my new cast?

107
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,180
I think that's an awful idea, but I'll have a drink with you when the cast comes off.

108
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,840
You should be fine.

109
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,240
Five days and you can go back to the fields.

110
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,440
Good news, huh, Mr. Shono?

111
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,420
Doctor, why don't you take some potatoes?

112
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,260
We had a good crop this year.

113
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,800
I'll remember that offer when I come back some afternoon with a truck.

114
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,740
[laughing]

115
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,980
Thanks for the help.

116
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,980
My specialty's internal medicine,

117
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,520
but I have to be a jack of all trades out here.

118
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,260
I'm all the doctoring these folks get, and there's only one of me.

119
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,820
It's wonderful.

120
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,880
Yeah, tranquility's the one thing this place has in spades.

121
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,600
No, I didn't mean the land.

122
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,980
I mean how much you love all the people in this village.

123
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,780
how much they all seem to love you back.

124
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,780
Hmm. Love, huh?

125
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,380
That ship sailed a long time ago.

126
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,080
This is my job, and that's why I do it.

127
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,580
Well, one last stop, and you're a free man.

128
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,760
I saved the best for last.

129
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
You just don't quit, do you?

130
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,320
Quit? I don't even know the meaning of the word.

131
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,480
And it'll be the same thing no matter how many times you come back.

132
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:39,540
you quack like I'm talking to a mule Petra's the mother of that officer who

133
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,080
had you spooked she collapsed three days ago working in the fields I talked her

134
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,900
into coming down to the clinic but she changed her mind on the way over she's

135
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:54,520
been holed up in there ever since that is worrisome not to butt in but do you

136
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,520
mind if I try talking to her it's not gonna make a lick of difference I'll

137
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,180
Doctor, please, you have to calm down.

138
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,680
She'll never come out if you keep yelling at her like that.

139
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,660
You're getting a check-up and that's final!

140
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,420
I'm not going to stand the possibility of losing you!

141
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,020
Huh?

142
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,340
What I mean is, I wouldn't have anyone to fight with anymore.

143
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,760
Also, I wouldn't be able to eat that goulash of hers if that stubborn old thing passed on.

144
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,380
Hey, mister, how come your face is red?

145
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,140
What did you say, you little brat?

146
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,800
Please, Miss Petra, open the door.

147
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,420
Another doctor? Are you kidding me?

148
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,260
What did I say? It's a waste of time.

149
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,600
So tell me, why do you hate doctors?

150
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,760
Why do I hate doctors?

151
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,060
I'll tell you why.

152
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,480
You play God with people's lives. That's why.

153
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,920
God? Don't I wish.

154
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,680
Sometimes I think it would be great if we were.

155
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,120
We try our best, but we make mistakes, too.

156
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,840
Wouldn't it be great if doctors could be perfect like God and just heal people?

157
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,440
When I see my patients, it's always the same.

158
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,800
On the inside, I'm trembling like a leaf.

159
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,880
Please, Miss Petra, let me at least see you.

160
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,840
Huh?

161
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,660
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

162
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,340
Hmm? What is it I'm smelling?

163
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,060
You're cooking up some goulash in here, aren't you?

164
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,760
Why are you asking? You like goulash or something?

165
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,580
I do, but it seems that Dr. Shuman is a particularly big fan of it.

166
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,000
At least, that's what he told me, anyway.

167
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,540
Well, that's news to me.

168
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,040
I always make it for him and he eats it, but he never says a word.

169
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,540
He's very shy.

170
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,820
This looks really delicious.

171
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,960
My goodness, my shoulders are so stiff

172
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,640
and I still have a lot of food to prepare for tonight's dinner.

173
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
Stiff shoulders.

174
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Miss Petra, can you touch your chin down to your chest?

175
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,100
Of course I can. It's easy enough to do. Watch.

176
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:12,720
Oh.

177
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,720
Let me just check something, ma'am.

178
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,140
Four fingers wide.

179
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,660
So what was that all about?

180
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,900
Oh, uh, nothing.

181
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:38,300
how is she it isn't good a subarachnoid hemorrhage wait what did you say hey

182
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,620
Heinz the facts came in for a murder suspect make some copies is your mom

183
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,580
okay I heard that she had a fainting spell three days ago oh she's all right

184
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,560
yeah that tough old lady's gonna outlive all of us

185
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,760
The first stroke occurred less than three days ago.

186
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,020
We can still make it, but we need to operate immediately.

187
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,020
Can we get a helicopter here in time?

188
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,280
Can you do it?

189
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,380
Please.

190
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,860
If you can perform this operation, then do it.

191
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,440
If you can't, then my failings will have lost me the woman I love for a second time.

192
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,280
Are you sure that it's Kenzo Tenma?

193
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,260
Positive.

194
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,340
All right, he probably hasn't gone far.

195
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,860
Set up checkpoints along the highway.

196
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,680
If we catch this guy, it'll be big, Hines.

197
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,800
Yes, sir.

198
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,080
Prepare for emergency deployment.

199
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,540
This is great.

200
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,560
If things go well, I'll get promoted.

201
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,540
Hey, Hines, you have a call.

202
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,760
This is Hines speaking.

203
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,880
Oh?

204
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,280
The nurse from the clinic?

205
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,580
What?

206
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,420
Are you kidding me? My mother collapsed again?

207
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,600
God, why didn't I drag her into town?

208
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,700
If they had checked her at the state hospital, it wouldn't have come to this!

209
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,100
Dr. Tenma, you're the only one who can save her.

210
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,400
Just as I suspected.

211
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,280
It's an aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery.

212
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,200
Damn it.

213
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,640
We don't even have a surgical microscope or a craniotome here.

214
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,740
I can still do it, as long as I have an aneurysm clip.

215
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,800
No, it's too difficult.

216
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,660
We've got no other option here.

217
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,480
If the aneurysm ruptures, I'm afraid she's not going to survive the night.

218
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,560
It's my fault this is happening again.

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,860
What are you talking about, Dr. Shuman?

220
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,120
Those aren't the words of a man who's single-handedly taken care of this entire town.

221
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,520
I don't know what happened in the past, but you have to do the best job you can do right now.

222
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,760
That's all we as doctors can do.

223
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,420
Yeah.

224
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,400
(grunting)

225
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,320
- Hey kid, Dr. Shuman's inside, isn't he?

226
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,080
- Mm-hmm, he's operating right now.

227
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,640
- What do you mean he's operating?

228
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,380
Why are they doing it here at this clinic

229
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,440
instead of taking her to the hospital in town?

230
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,920
- Hey, don't worry, Tenma's in there helping.

231
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,460
- Tenma's in there?

232
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,560
- How's her blood pressure and pulse?

233
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,400
- Blood pressure holding steady at 126 over 84.

234
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,360
Amazing. He's so fast and efficient, even without the benefit of a craniotome.

235
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,720
Huh? What the hell are you doing?

236
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,220
We're operating on your mother. Isn't that obvious? What are you doing with that gun?

237
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,120
Put your hands up, Tenma! Do it!

238
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,700
If he stops now, she'll die. Is that what you want?

239
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,120
He's the one trying to kill her! Tenma is wanted for murder! He's a suspect in several killings!

240
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,140
he killed a man in Heidelberg and he's the prime suspect in the serial murders

241
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:05,840
of those couples who would have thought that I'd find you here leave it to good

242
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,260
old mom always looking for new ways to help out her boy now put your hands up

243
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,860
tenma if you don't I'll shoot like hell you will this is a sterile operating

244
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,620
room or it was until you came barging in do you want your mother to die of

245
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,700
meningitis because it's very likely to happen if you keep standing there then

246
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,220
She's going to die, Heinz. Don't you get it?

247
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,280
There's a subarachnoid hemorrhage in your mother's brain,

248
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,740
and she's had it for three entire days.

249
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,960
If we don't save her now, she dies.

250
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,980
Now get out of here, Heinz!

251
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,080
No way! I'm onto you, Tenma!

252
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,800
You're just planning on using my mom as a hostage so you can run away from here!

253
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,540
All right, nurse. Aneurysm clip and forceps, please.

254
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,220
Aneurysm clip and forceps, now!

255
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:02,980
Yes, that's my mother on that table. I won't let anyone hurt her. Yes Petra's your mother and you're her son

256
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,480
But what kind of son have you been to her these past five years? I know you didn't visit her once since you left for the

257
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,780
city

258
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,420
She sacrificed a lot for you. And what have you done for her in return anything?

259
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,320
Listen, son, the folks we love can be gone in an instant

260
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,240
Do you remember what your mother's goulash tastes like?

261
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,080
Even now, years later, Petra sets out a dish for you.

262
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,040
I should know. I'm the one who eats it.

263
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,880
Remember how delicious it is?

264
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,120
Dr. Tenma is fighting to save your mother.

265
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,440
He's giving it everything he's got.

266
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,240
So if you ever want to taste that goulash again,

267
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,700
you'll get out of here now!

268
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,900
See? Tenma's there.

269
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,820
It's okay.

270
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,900
Blood pressure 140 over 86, pulse 82.

271
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,800
Good. Her vital signs have stabilized.

272
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,260
Why don't you get some rest, Miss Pionier?

273
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,020
Doctor, you've been up all day.

274
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,820
What? Like you haven't? I'll be just fine.

275
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,420
Yes, sir.

276
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,560
You did well today.

277
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,760
Dr. Tanma, you should get some rest, too.

278
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,840
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

279
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,680
You're fine. That was a grueling operation. You must be dead on your feet

280
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,640
I want to stay and make sure she pulls through that way when miss Petra has recovered enough

281
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,040
You can go ahead and finally propose to her

282
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,260
What do you mean propose?

283
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,040
Huh? Hey, I thought you were supposed to be asleep

284
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,260
I'm not sleeping not until I take him down to this station

285
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,840
What's he talking about? Anyway, you're not thinking about marrying my mom. Are you of course not?

286
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:54,320
me stupid. Even if I did, I'm not the kind of man who's worthy of proposing to anyone.

287
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,020
I used to work at the university hospital. Didn't give a damn about any of my patients.

288
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,400
All I cared about was moving up the ladder faster than the next guy. I got in good with

289
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,560
the director and ended up writing all his research papers for him. Would you believe

290
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,040
it? Even married the boss's daughter. What a cliché. Oh, I moved up that damn ladder

291
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,260
and ignored her like the wrong she was.

292
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,180
If only I had been a real doctor

293
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,140
or shown her the least bit of attention,

294
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,420
I'd have known in a moment.

295
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,180
- Huh?

296
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,740
- My wife came down with a simple cold.

297
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,800
At least that's what I wrote it off as.

298
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,100
If only I had looked at her, I would have seen it.

299
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,120
An intern would have seen it.

300
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,840
Severe liver failure.

301
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,780
Before she died, she said,

302
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,880
- I finally have your undivided attention.

303
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,440
I don't deserve to love anybody after what I did to that poor woman.

304
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,440
That's not true.

305
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,580
You have been paying attention, Doctor.

306
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,320
You've been watching over the people of this village.

307
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,060
Petra is going to survive this, because you were watching.

308
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,420
Do you still plan on taking this man to jail?

309
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,620
He did everything in his power last night to save your mother's life.

310
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,480
What kind of murderer would do that?

311
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:35,800
Heinz!

312
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,660
This is Heinz.

313
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,660
Get me the chief.

314
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,940
Chief, I made a mistake.

315
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:43,860
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,540
We should cancel this search.

317
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,300
The man I saw before was not Tenma.

318
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,920
He was another doctor by the name of Chan.

319
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,840
I thought it was him because he was Asian.

320
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,240
Yes, that's right.

321
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,300
Yes, sir, I'm very sorry.

322
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,920
The doctor from the state hospital sure did seem surprised.

323
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,400
Well, of course he did.

324
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,220
He probably never expected to see such amazing results

325
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,040
from a little clinic in the boonies.

326
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,760
Shuman! Are you really going to let that young doctor leave?

327
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,420
I was making him something to eat, but he packed his bags and left with the kid!

328
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,280
Tenma!

329
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,180
Don't go! This town is safe for you! There's no need to run away!

330
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,220
Dr. Shuman, what are you...

331
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,040
Dieter! This is a nice village, isn't it?

332
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,080
a very good place for a boy like Dieter here.

333
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,740
Yes, but not only for him.

334
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,000
You could stop running.

335
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,820
You'll be off the radar if you stay.

336
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,420
The folks in this village need more than I can give them on my own.

337
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,980
Together there's no end to the good we could do.

338
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,900
I can't.

339
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,360
I'm sorry, but I really have to be moving on.

340
