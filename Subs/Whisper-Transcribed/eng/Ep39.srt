00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:10,120
We've just confirmed. At least five are dead and 34 injured due to a fire that broke out here, at the University of Munich's Friedrich Emanuel Campus Library.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,200
A grueling search for the missing is still underway.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,020
Earlier, we had a chance to talk to some of the survivors. Let's take a look.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,680
I just suddenly found myself surrounded by fire everywhere.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,300
The smoke was so thick in the air I could hardly breathe. I thought I would die.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,660
Then somebody rushed in and saved us.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,780
Yeah, he was this young Asian man.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,000
Is he all right?

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,300
I saw him shoot the hinges off the door to get it open, but after that,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
if it weren't for him, so many of us would have died.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,640
The police have confirmed that the fire was started with a mixed kerosene gasoline accelerant.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,780
The police have also promised to bring the arsonist to justice as swiftly as possible.

We'll see you next time.

18
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:32,840
It's completely destroyed

19
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,920
So much for this so-called legacy of human wisdom

20
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,720
Ashes to ashes, I guess

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,080
Were there any fingerprints on the sniper rifle we found?

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,620
I don't think we're going to be able to pull any reasonable prints

23
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,020
On the other hand, the weapon is a Mauser SR-93,

24
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,380
just like the one purchased by that Japanese man who we believe to be Dr. Tenma.

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm telling you, it's going to be difficult to find any trace of the perpetrator.

26
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,020
A fire this hot really cleans a crime scene.

27
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,300
There's no such thing as a clean crime scene.

28
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,060
Huh?

29
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,440
Here's a cufflink.

30
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,960
Here, send it to the lab.

31
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,680
Someone was here.

32
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,400
And nobody can do anything without leaving some sort of trace of themselves.

33
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,460
If there were such a person, he could hardly be considered human.

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,060
But let's suppose someone was here and that we still couldn't find any trace of him.

35
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,300
Who does that?

36
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,120
Only a demon.

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,480
However, since no such thing exists, there must be someone real to arrest.

38
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,440
Arrange a meeting with Shuval for me.

39
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,280
But he's still held up in the intensive care unit.

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,340
Admittedly, his burns aren't really that severe, but because of his advanced age, the doctors are refusing to allow him any visitors.

41
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,140
Let's go.

42
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,560
You're being unreasonable, sir. He's not ready for visitors yet.

43
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,360
He's conscious, isn't he? I only need a few minutes of his time.

44
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,560
My patient, Mr. Schuwold, is suffering from severe shock. He needs absolute quiet.

45
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
Who's the young man?

46
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,720
Oh, him. That's Mr. Schuwold's son.

47
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,280
I'm sorry such a terrible thing happened to your father.

48
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,280
My name is Lungay. I'm with the BKA.

49
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Sir, I know I've already talked to the police about this,

50
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,280
but there's someone I really need to find.

51
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Wait, who is he?

52
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,280
The person in that photograph is the man who tried to assassinate your father.

53
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Huh?

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Are you sure you don't recognize him?

55
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,280
I've never seen him before, but maybe Johan would have.

56
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Johan?

57
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
That's what I've been trying to tell everybody!

58
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,280
His name is Johan Liebert, and I need you to find him!

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Johan Liebert, eh?

60
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,280
The last time I saw Johan, he was going to attend the ceremony at the library with my father.

61
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,280
But I've searched everywhere, and I can't find him!

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Johan.

63
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,280
Johan Liebert.

64
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:17,720
Yes, I understand. I'll call for a search immediately.

65
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:26,060
This is the room Johann Liebert was renting. Like I said before, he moved out of here two

66
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:46,580
Two weeks ago.

67
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,120
We checked at the law school at Friedrich Emanuel, but his name didn't show up at the

68
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
registrar's.

69
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
He really wasn't a student.

70
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,220
Didn't he say his parents lived in Offenbach?

71
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,220
about them? Yeah, that parent angle turned out to be another dead end. It seems they never really

72
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,480
talked to any of their neighbors. I guess there's nothing left to do except dust for prints, huh?

73
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:16,500
We're probably not going to find anything. I have no data to input. Never before.

74
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,920
I've never seen a room so devoid of any human presence

75
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,340
Yeah

76
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,120
I am Johan

77
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,620
I am Johan Liebert

78
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,440
Who am I?

79
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,500
I was here

80
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,920
But I don't exist

81
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,540
Am I a demon?

82
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,760
I'm just glad your injuries weren't that bad, Nina.

83
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,180
I'm sorry to make you worry, Loda. Thank you.

84
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,740
Well, of course I was going to worry about you.

85
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,560
I mean, they kept pulling survivors out of the library, and you were still nowhere to be found.

86
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,020
I didn't know what had happened to you.

87
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,520
Still, it's a miracle you made it out of the library all on your own with those injuries

88
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,100
Even the firefighters were shocked

89
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,640
That's because someone saved me

90
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,320
Somebody saved you?

91
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,060
Nina, you were the last person that made it out of the building

92
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,040
A Japanese man

93
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,320
Huh?

94
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,120
Do you know if there was a Japanese doctor among any of the survivors?

95
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,080
There were some Japanese people, but all of them were just businessmen.

96
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,320
That is impossible.

97
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,500
Huh?

98
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,840
Inside the library, I was trapped under a curtain when he found me.

99
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,460
Nina!

100
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,540
Nina!

101
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,660
Nina!

102
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,620
I'm sure that he was real.

103
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,140
I know he was.

104
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,260
According to witnesses,

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,620
just before the fire started,

106
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,020
you told everyone attending the ceremony to evacuate.

107
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,480
Why? What would cause you to do something like that?

108
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,260
You knew something was about to happen.

109
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,280
Was that it, Mr. Schuwald?

110
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,320
Why don't we call it a day?

111
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,560
Mr. Shuval, do you know the man in this photograph?

112
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Can you see the man in the photograph clearly, sir?

113
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,880
This is the man who we believe tried to assassinate you.

114
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,520
We have witnesses placing him at the library.

115
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,760
But here's what doesn't make sense to me.

116
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,660
All of our witnesses claim to have seen this man rescuing people from the fire.

117
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Look, that's enough. Please, just let him rest.

118
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Don't forget to contact me if you should remember anything else.

119
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Just one more thing.

120
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Do you know where your secretary Johann Liebert has disappeared to?

121
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,600
Please, just leave already!

122
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,480
Looks like he's gone completely senile.

123
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,860
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,060
I mean, when you see something that terrifying at his age, you know.

125
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,520
So ends the reign of the Vampire of Bavaria, once great emperor of the business world.

126
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,620
No.

127
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,520
Huh?

128
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,420
He understood every word I said.

129
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:02,960
Oh.

130
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,120
Let's question the other witnesses, shall we? Do you have the list of victims?

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,740
Oh, yeah. But what's this all about?

132
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,160
We have testimonials that point to our man Tenma trying to save people from the fire.

133
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,060
Maybe it's just like that multiple personality theory?

134
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,980
Nina. Nina Fortner.

135
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,440
What about Nina Fortner?

136
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:47,440
If you're looking for Nina Fortner, she checked out of the hospital this morning

137
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,900
And unfortunately, the address we have for her in the police register is fictitious

138
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,300
How about the hospitals?

139
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,340
Yes, sir

140
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,080
I'll look it up right now

141
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,920
Nina Fortner

142
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,220
There was a Nina Fortner whose parents were killed in Heidelberg

143
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,660
Her current whereabouts are unknown.

144
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,240
Thank you for sharing such a painful story with me.

145
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,960
You know, Nina, it matches up perfectly with another story from ten years ago told to me by Dr. Tenma.

146
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,400
Tenma?

147
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Yes, and that story started him down a path that led him here.

148
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,460
And from here he set off on his journey to kill Johan.

149
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:37,680
Nina, that day, I went to the library because I thought that Tenma was going to carry out his assassination attempt

150
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,860
But then, with that fire, I don't even know for sure if Tenma was there, let alone Johan

151
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,540
Please, Nina, let go of any thoughts of chasing down Johan

152
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,980
He's not someone you can handle yourself

153
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,180
Look, I know the police don't seem very helpful.

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,360
But we have to try and lay low and take our time to fight this.

155
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,760
I promise the truth will be revealed in time.

156
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,080
It's okay. We're all here for you.

157
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,680
You must be tired.

158
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,460
Please feel free to stay here as long as you like.

159
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,980
He was there.

160
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,120
Huh?

161
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,140
Tenma, I mean.

162
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,460
I saw him that day.

163
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,260
Tenma was there in the library.

164
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:40,000
♪ ♪

165
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You've got to eat something.

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I know, Dieter. Thank you.

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's called a kaiser roll.

168
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It has roasted ham and gouda cheese on it.

169
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Tenma really likes them.

170
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,720
That's very kind of you.

171
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,120
It's yummy.

172
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,300
Really?

173
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,020
Nothing picks me up like something delicious.

174
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,800
Tenma always used to say that too.

175
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,940
I want to see him.

176
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,980
I want to see Tenma again.

177
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,360
Yeah

178
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:35,520
The weather's finally starting to look nice again

179
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,640
Father, when you're feeling better

180
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,280
Why don't we take a vacation together?

181
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,560
Maybe the two of us could tour Asia

182
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,120
I think a change of atmosphere would be nice

183
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,600
Why don't you just rest a bit longer?

184
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,420
I know you've been through more than enough recently

185
00:13:52,420 --> 00:14:08,200
bridge there were three father what is it are you trying to tell me something the three frogs

186
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:18,720
three frogs in his eyes what i saw hell right there in his eyes

187
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,800
hell in the eyes of a living human being.

188
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,000
Carl.

189
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,880
Yes?

190
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,800
I need you to deliver a message to a certain man.

191
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,280
I... yes.

192
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,020
There's a man.

193
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,620
A man waiting in Dresden.

194
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,960
In Dresden?

195
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,100
What do you want me to say when I find him?

196
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,020
I want you to tell him that I...

197
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,540
Yes.

198
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,480
And the man in Dresden, he'll know what you're talking about, right?

199
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,660
So, should I leave now, Father?

200
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,180
I understand. I'll leave immediately.

201
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:08,740
Carl, I know that your mother hated me in the end.

202
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,100
You're wrong. I promise, she never hated you.

203
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:22,880
Carl, when you return from Dresden, can you promise that you will come back and stay with me?

204
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,500
Yes.

205
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,940
I'm afraid.

206
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,560
I see. Afraid of what?

207
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,100
I don't know, but I'm afraid.

208
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,560
Try and stay calm. We need you to remember, just go slow.

209
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,920
Like a town from a fairy tale.

210
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,660
A fairy tale village. Where was it?

211
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,400
The feelings that you had when you were looking at this picture book.

212
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,780
Just tell me whatever pops into your head.

213
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,520
Dr. Gillen, careful.

214
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,000
Just a little bit more.

215
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,700
Stop! That's enough!

216
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,780
There were three.

217
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,720
There were three frogs.

218
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,700
There were three frogs?

219
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,900
Three frogs.

220
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,080
What are you talking about?

221
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,040
Picture.

222
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,480
What? Is there a picture of three frogs in the children's book that made Johan faint?

223
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,900
I've been through that book cover to cover a dozen times and I've never seen a single frog anywhere.

224
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,520
Then where did you see them?

225
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,640
It's all right. Why don't we stop here for now?

226
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,040
Okay.

227
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,900
I'm going on record saying it was a mistake

228
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,360
to trust that Inspector Lungay from the BKA.

229
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,940
Yes, I think it's time for us to rethink our strategies.

230
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,860
The next time we take anything to the authorities,

231
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,560
we'll talk to his superiors.

232
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,900
And that's only after we've taken our time

233
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,740
to gather irrefutable evidence to support our claim.

234
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:27,840
Agreed?

235
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,480
You think we should take our time?

236
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,060
How much time?

237
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,480
As of now, the profile we built for Johan

238
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,320
is vague and unimpressive at best.

239
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,440
Johan was Schuwalt's secretary.

240
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,800
It's reasonable to think Schuwalt might have some information.

241
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,120
But he's not taking visitors at the moment.

242
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,900
How about his son, Carl?

243
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,940
Don't know. He's been gone for the past couple of days now, and I can't get a hold of him.

244
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,060
It's nothing concrete, but I've heard some of the witnesses say

245
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,660
that an anonymous Asian man was seen rescuing people from the library fire.

246
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,220
But if they find Tenma's fingerprints on the sniper rifle,

247
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,560
then all those witness reports won't mean anything.

248
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,200
They'll just assume he's guilty.

249
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,000
Why wouldn't they?

250
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,620
It all will have been for naught.

251
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,180
How long do we have to wait?

252
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,580
We don't have any time.

253
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,240
By the time the truth is revealed

254
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,860
and the police finally make a move,

255
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,440
by that time,

256
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,860
Tenno, he'll already be...

257
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,660
Nina.

258
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,820
I'm so sorry.

259
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,980
Nina, I understand how you feel about this.

260
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,420
I told you before I lost one of my closest and dearest friends

261
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:42,660
Richard to this case. He had such a bright future ahead of him, but Johan cut his future short.

262
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,220
I am not giving up on this. I never will.

263
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,260
Now, let's eat.

264
00:18:52,260 --> 00:19:02,140
Three frogs

265
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,860
Like a town from a fairy tale

266
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,180
With three

267
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:20,560
I remember

268
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:46,340
Peter, I...

269
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,780
I'm going to.

270
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,560
What are you saying? Dieter, you can't come with me.

271
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
You need to stay right here, all right?

272
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,560
And please tell Dr. Reichwein that I said thank you for everything he's done for me.

273
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Take care.

274
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Dieter!

275
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
I wanna...

276
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
I wanna see Tenma!

277
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:43,600
the third day was a bus too

278
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,040
wait in the town square he says

279
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,300
he's gotta be kidding

280
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,820
this place is just too big

281
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:57,820
Sorry, Father. It doesn't seem like I'll be meeting up with the man you talked about after all.

282
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,640
Carl.

283
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,720
Huh?

284
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,300
You're Carl, right?

285
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,980
Wait, it's you!

286
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,700
The man who was attempting to assassinate your father.

287
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,620
Is that what the police told you?

288
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,320
Uh, yeah.

289
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,640
Well, at least it doesn't look like they have anybody tailing you.

290
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,560
For three days, I've been watching you from that building.

291
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,320
All right, you can give me the message now.

292
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,240
Try and hold on. We're almost out of here.

293
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,100
Just run. You have to go. The police are on their way.

294
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,820
But I can't just...

295
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,240
In Dresden, the public square by the station,

296
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,740
my son Carl will bring you a message I...

297
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:58,960
Give me the message.

298
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,060
Here it is.

299
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,260
Chidok Bridge and the Three Frogs.

300
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
My father said something else also.

301
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,060
If the monster that you're chasing happens to have a twin...

302
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:20,060
The mother of those same twins is still alive in Brokk.
