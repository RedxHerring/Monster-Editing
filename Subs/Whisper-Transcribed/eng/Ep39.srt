1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,540
We've just confirmed at least five are dead and 34 injured due to a fire that

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,620
broke out here at the University of Munich's Friedrich Emanuel Campus

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,900
Library. A grueling search for the missing is still underway. Earlier we had

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,680
a chance to talk to some of the survivors. Let's take a look. I just

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,540
suddenly found myself surrounded by fire everywhere. The smoke was so thick in the

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,100
air I could hardly breathe. I thought I would die. Then somebody rushed in and

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, he was this young Asian man. Is he all right?

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,300
I saw him shoot the hinges off the door to get it open, but after that,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
if it weren't for him, so many of us would have died.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,660
The police have confirmed that the fire was started with a mixed kerosene-gasoline accelerant.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,760
The police have also promised to bring the arsonist to justice as swiftly as possible.

12
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,060
(dramatic music)

13
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,820
It's completely destroyed.

14
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,920
So much for this so-called legacy of human wisdom.

15
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,700
Ashes to ashes, I guess.

16
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,080
Were there any fingerprints on the sniper rifle we found?

17
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,600
I don't think we're going to be able to pull any reasonable prints.

18
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,940
On the other hand, the weapon is a Mauser SR-93,

19
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,420
just like the one purchased by that Japanese man who we believe to be Dr. Tenma.

20
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm telling you, it's going to be difficult to find any trace of the perpetrator.

21
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,020
A fire this hot really cleans a crime scene.

22
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,300
There's no such thing as a clean crime scene.

23
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,080
Huh?

24
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Here's a cuff link.

25
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,980
Here, send it to the lab.

26
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,140
But...

27
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,700
Someone was here,

28
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,860
and nobody can do anything

29
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,400
without leaving some sort of trace of themselves.

30
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,800
If there were such a person,

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,420
he could hardly be considered human.

32
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,980
But let's suppose someone was here

33
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,060
and that we still couldn't find any trace of him.

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,300
Who does that?

35
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,120
Only a demon.

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,820
However, since no such thing exists,

37
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,180
There must be someone real to arrest.

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,460
Arrange a meeting with Shuval for me.

39
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,280
But he's still held up in the intensive care unit.

40
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,100
Admittedly, his burns aren't really that severe,

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,040
but because of his advanced age,

42
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,340
the doctors are refusing to allow him any visitors.

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,140
Let's go.

44
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,540
You're being unreasonable, sir. He's not ready for visitors yet.

45
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,020
He's conscious, isn't he?

46
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,360
I only need a few minutes of his time.

47
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,800
Mr. Schuwalt is suffering from severe shock.

48
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,660
He needs absolute quiet.

49
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,640
Who's the young man?

50
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,720
Oh, him. That's Mr. Schuwalt's son.

51
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,500
I'm sorry such a terrible thing happened to your father.

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,680
My name is LÃ¼nge. I'm with the BKA.

53
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,400
Sir, I know I've already talked to the police about this,

54
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,680
but there's someone I really need to find.

55
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,240
Wait, who is he?

56
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,680
The person in that photograph is the man who tried to assassinate your father.

57
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,920
Huh?

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,640
Are you sure you don't recognize him?

59
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,980
I've never seen him before, but maybe Johan would have.

60
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,220
Johan?

61
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,660
That's what I've been trying to tell everybody!

62
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
His name is Johan Liebert, and I need you to find him!

63
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,100
Johan Liebert, eh?

64
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,120
I saw Johan. He was going to attend the ceremony at the library with my father.

65
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,040
But I've searched everywhere, and I can't find him!

66
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,220
Johan. Johan Liebert.

67
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,600
Yes, I understand. I'll call for a search immediately.

68
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,640
This is the room Johan Liebert was renting.

69
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,860
Like I said before, he moved out of here two weeks ago.

70
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,620
We checked at the law school at Friedrich Emanuel,

71
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,040
up at the registrar's. He really wasn't a student.

72
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,860
Didn't he say his parents lived in Offenbach? What about them?

73
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,520
Yeah, that parent angle turned out to be another dead end. It seems they never really talked

74
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,480
to any of their neighbors. I guess there's nothing left to do except dust for prints, huh?

75
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,700
We're probably not going to find anything.

76
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,060
I have no data to input.

77
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,900
Never before... I've never seen a room so devoid of any human presence.

78
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,400
Yeah...

79
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:37,860
I am Johan. I am Johan Liebert. Who am I? I was here... but I don't exist.

80
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,540
Am I a demon?

81
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,740
(evil laugh)

82
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,780
I'm just glad your injuries weren't that bad, Nina.

83
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,180
I'm sorry to make you worry, Loda. Thank you.

84
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,580
Well, of course I was going to worry about you. I mean, they kept pulling survivors out of the library and you were still nowhere to be found.

85
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,000
I didn't know what had happened to you.

86
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,500
Still, it's a miracle you made it out of the library all on your own with those injuries.

87
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,080
Even the firefighters were shocked.

88
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,540
That's because someone saved me.

89
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,300
Somebody saved you?

90
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,000
Nina, you were the last person that made it out of the building.

91
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,980
A Japanese man.

92
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,280
Huh?

93
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,100
Do you know if there was a Japanese doctor among any of the survivors?

94
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,060
There were some Japanese people, but all of them were just businessmen.

95
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,360
That is impossible.

96
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,780
Inside the library, I was trapped under a curtain when he found me.

97
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,260
Nina! Nina! Nina!

98
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,140
I'm sure that he was real. I know he was.

99
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,620
According to witnesses, just before the fire started,

100
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,980
you told everyone attending the ceremony to evacuate.

101
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,500
Why? What would cause you to do something like that?

102
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,280
You knew something was about to happen. Was that it, Mr. Schuwald?

103
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,320
Why don't we call it a day?

104
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,900
do you know the man in this photograph?

105
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,700
Can you see the man in the photograph clearly, sir?

106
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,300
This is the man who we believe tried to assassinate you.

107
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,420
We have witnesses placing him at the library.

108
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,480
But here's what doesn't make sense to me.

109
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,260
All of our witnesses claim to have seen this man rescuing people from the fire.

110
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,620
Look, that's enough.

111
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,260
Please, just let him rest.

112
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,120
Don't forget to contact me if you should remember anything else.

113
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,760
Just one more thing.

114
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,840
Do you know where your secretary, Johann Liebert, has disappeared to?

115
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,600
Please, just leave already!

116
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,480
Looks like he's gone completely senile.

117
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,880
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

118
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,060
I mean, when you see something that terrifying at his age, you know.

119
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,520
So ends the reign of the Vampire of Bavaria, once great emperor of the business world.

120
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,620
No.

121
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,500
Huh?

122
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,420
He understood every word I said.

123
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:02,960
Oh.

124
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,300
Let's question the other witnesses shall we do you have the list of victims? Oh?

125
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:08,820
Yeah

126
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,700
But what's this all about?

127
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,180
We have testimonials that point to our man tenma trying to save people from the fire

128
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,540
Maybe it's just like that multiple personality theory

129
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,460
Nina Nina Fortner what about Nina Fortner?

130
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,020
"If you're looking for Nina Fortner, she checked out of the hospital this morning."

131
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,860
"And unfortunately, the address we have for her in the police register is fictitious.

132
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,580
How about the hospitals?"

133
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,340
"Yes, sir.

134
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,700
I'll look it up right now."

135
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,900
"Nina Fortner.

136
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,200
There was a Nina Fortner whose parents were killed in Heidelberg.

137
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,680
Current whereabouts are unknown.

138
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,240
Thank you for sharing such a painful story with me.

139
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,240
You know, Nina, it matches up perfectly with another story from ten years ago,

140
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,980
told to me by Dr. Tenma.

141
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,420
Tenma?

142
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,020
Yes. And that story started him down a path that led him here.

143
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,460
And from here, he set off on his journey to kill Johan.

144
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:37,660
Nina, that day, I went to the library because I thought that Tenma was going to carry out his assassination attempt.

145
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:44,840
But then, with that fire, I don't even know for sure if Tenma was there, let alone Johan.

146
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,560
Please, Nina, let go of any thoughts of chasing down Johan.

147
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,620
He's not someone you can handle yourself.

148
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,200
Look, I know the police don't seem very helpful,

149
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,340
but we have to try and lay low and take our time to fight this.

150
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,760
I promise the truth will be revealed in time.

151
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,080
It's okay. We're all here for you.

152
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,680
You must be tired.

153
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,460
Please feel free to stay here as long as you like.

154
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,980
He was there.

155
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,100
Huh?

156
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,140
Tenma, I mean.

157
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,480
I saw him that day.

158
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Tenma was there in the library.

159
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,340
You've got to eat something.

160
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,180
I know, Dieter. Thank you.

161
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
It's called a kaiser roll.

162
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,300
It had ham and gouda cheese on it.

163
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,400
Tenma really likes them.

164
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,720
That's very kind of you.

165
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
It's yummy.

166
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,300
Really?

167
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,020
Nothing picks me up like something delicious.

168
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Tenma always used to say that, too.

169
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,940
I want to see him.

170
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,000
I want to see Tenma again.

171
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,340
Yeah.

172
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,460
The weather's finally starting to look nice again.

173
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,280
Father, when you're feeling better, why don't we take a vacation together?

174
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,540
Maybe the two of us could tour Asia.

175
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I think a change of atmosphere would be nice.

176
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,600
Why don't you just rest a bit longer?

177
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,540
you've been through more than enough recently.

178
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,760
- Bridge, there were three.

179
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,400
- Father, what is it?

180
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,860
Are you trying to tell me something?

181
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,760
- The three frogs, three frogs in his eyes.

182
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,160
- What?

183
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,380
- I saw hell right there in his eyes, hell.

184
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,820
in the eyes of a living human being.

185
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,000
Carl.

186
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,860
Yes?

187
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,780
I need you to deliver a message to a certain man.

188
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,280
I... yes.

189
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,580
There's a man. A man waiting in Dresden.

190
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,100
In Dresden? What do you want me to say when I find him?

191
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,020
I want you to tell him that I...

192
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,520
Yes.

193
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,480
And the man in Dresden, he'll know what you're talking about, right?

194
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,660
So, should I leave now, Father?

195
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,180
I understand. I'll leave immediately.

196
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,000
Karl...

197
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,740
I know that... I know that your mother hated me in the end.

198
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,100
You're wrong. I promise, she never hated you.

199
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,900
Karl, when you return from Dresden,

200
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,860
can you promise that you will come back and stay with me?

201
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,500
Yes.

202
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,920
I'm afraid.

203
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,560
I see. Afraid of what?

204
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,100
I don't know, but I'm afraid.

205
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,400
Try and stay calm.

206
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,580
We need you to remember, just go slow.

207
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:53,700
"A fairytale village. Where was it? The feelings that you had when you were looking at this

208
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,680
picture book. Just tell me whatever pops into your head."

209
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,780
"Dr. Gillen, careful."

210
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,260
"Just a little bit more."

211
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,780
"Stop! That's enough!"

212
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,740
There were three frogs.

213
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,700
There were three frogs?

214
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,900
Three frogs.

215
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,060
What are you talking about?

216
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,060
Picture.

217
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,560
What?

218
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,500
Is there a picture of three frogs in the children's book that made Johan faint?

219
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,200
I've been through that book cover to cover a dozen times,

220
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,920
and I've never seen a single frog anywhere.

221
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,500
Then where did you see them?

222
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,640
It's all right. Why don't we stop here for now?

223
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,100
Okay.

224
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,340
I'm going on record saying it was a mistake to trust that Inspector Lungay from the BKA.

225
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,940
Yes, I think it's time for us to rethink our strategies.

226
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:27,860
The next time we take anything to the authorities, we'll talk to his superiors, and that's only after we've taken our time to gather irrefutable evidence to support our claim. Agreed?

227
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,060
You think we should take our time? How much time?

228
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:45,120
As of now, the profile we built for Johan is vague and unimpressive at best. Johan was Shuvalt's secretary. It's reasonable to think Shuvalt might have some information, but he's not taking visitors at the moment.

229
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,160
I don't know. He's been gone for the past couple of days now,

230
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,960
and I can't get a hold of him.

231
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,060
It's nothing concrete, but I've heard some of the witnesses say

232
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,640
that an anonymous Asian man was seen rescuing people from the library fire.

233
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,220
But if they find Tenma's fingerprints on the sniper rifle,

234
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,560
then all those witness reports won't mean anything.

235
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,000
They'll just assume he's guilty. Why wouldn't they?

236
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,620
It all will have been for naught.

237
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,180
How long do we have to wait?

238
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,580
We don't have any time.

239
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,660
And by the time the truth is revealed and the police finally make a move...

240
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,580
By that time, Tenno...he'll already be...

241
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,260
Nina...

242
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,820
I'm...I'm so sorry.

243
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,960
Nina, I understand how you feel about this.

244
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,560
I told you before I lost one of my closest and dearest friends, Richard, to this case.

245
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,300
He had such a bright future ahead of him.

246
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,700
But Johan cut his future short.

247
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,320
I'm not giving up on this. I never will.

248
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,360
Now, let's eat.

249
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,340
Three frogs...

250
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,610
Like a town from a fairy tale...

251
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,900
With three...

252
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,840
(sobbing)

253
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,560
I remember.

254
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,640
(crickets chirping)

255
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,720
Dieter, I...

256
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,660
I'm going to...

257
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,040
What are you saying? Dieter, you can't come with me.

258
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,160
You need to stay right here, alright?

259
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,740
And please tell Dr. Reichwein that I said thank you for everything he's done for me.

260
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,080
Take care.

261
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,780
Dieter!

262
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,460
I wanna...

263
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,020
I wanna see Tenma!

264
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,600
The third day was a bust, too.

265
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,040
"Wait in the town square," he says.

266
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,300
He's got to be kidding.

267
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,820
This place is just too big.

268
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,160
Sorry, Father.

269
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,860
It doesn't seem like I'll be meeting up with the man you talked about after all.

270
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,620
Carl.

271
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,680
Huh?

272
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,300
You're Carl, right?

273
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,960
Wait, it's you!

274
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,380
"The man who was attempting to assassinate your father, is that what the police told

275
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,260
you?"

276
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,880
"Uh, yeah."

277
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,660
"Well, at least it doesn't look like they have anybody tailing you.

278
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,560
For three days, I've been watching you from that building.

279
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,240
Alright, you can give me the message now."

280
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,760
"Try and hold on, we're almost out of here."

281
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,960
"Just run."

282
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,240
"You have to go, the police are on their way."

283
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,220
Dresden. The public square by the station.

284
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,760
My son Karl will bring you a message, I...

285
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,960
Give me the message.

286
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,080
Here it is.

287
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,180
Jadak Bridge and the Three Frogs.

288
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,300
My father said something else also.

289
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,360
If the monster that you're chasing happens to have a twin...

290
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,720
of those same twins is still alive in Brokk.

291
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,900
[MUSIC]

292
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,580
[MUSIC]

293
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,240
(upbeat music)
