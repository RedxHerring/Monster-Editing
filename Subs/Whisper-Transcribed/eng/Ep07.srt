I'm Nina!

Yeah, but we're from the station in Mannheim, the next town over.

00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,920
Why? Why are they taking us so far?

80
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Yeah, we're almost there. Just another 15 minutes or so.

Excuse me, detective.

109
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,000
Uh, she's not feeling so well back here.

110
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,600
Can she get some fresh air for a minute?

111
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,260
Oh, uh, sure. You go ahead.

112
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,040

113
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,500
Are these two in some kind of trouble?

114
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,480
Trouble? Not at all. It's nothing. Don't worry.

115
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,860
They seem like real detectives, but what about that blood?

116
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,180
Who could have called them?

117
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,540
Their sirens weren't even on.

118
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,060

119
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:01,840
What?

120
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,140
Hey, what's wrong, Dr. Tenma?

121
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,180
Are you two okay?

122
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,480
How?

123
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,440
How do you know who I am?

124
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,540
I gave you my name but I never told you not once that I was a doctor.

125
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,540
Tell me, how did you know that?

126
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,600
I found a grocery store nearby I also got you some dry clothes there's bread

127
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,760
I filled this thermos up with hot coffee, too.

128
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,400
You probably don't have much of an appetite, but you really should eat.

129
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,580
You're shivering. You should change out of those wet clothes.

130
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,920
(birds chirping)

131
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,440
- A lot of people were dead.

132
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,460
My brother and I were walking.

133
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,400
It was like we were all alone in the world.

134
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,940
Where were you when all of this happened?

135
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,280
Can you remember anything else?

136
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,900
We crossed the border.

137
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,060
Uncle and auntie helped us.

138
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,640
They were so kind to us.

139
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,860
Then my brother said,

140
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,660
"I have a good plan."

141
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,600
Soon after that,

142
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,560
my uncle and my dear auntie were both dead.

143
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:55,540
Anyone who was ever good to us died, without fail, all of them.

144
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,260
But then one day, one day, I discovered the reason why.

145
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,420
That rainy day.

146
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,360
You're talking about the incident with Mr. and Mrs. Liebert?

147
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,620
My brother did it. He shot them.

148
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,260
My brother, he... he murdered them.

149
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,060
He's the one who did all this.

150
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,240
My brother murdered them all.

151
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,420
So I picked up the gun with both my hands,

152
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,540
and then I aimed it right at my brother.

153
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,260
And that's when he said it.

154
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,080
He was smiling.

155
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,340
"After you shoot me,

156
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,400
make sure that you throw the gun out the window."

157
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,740
And he told me to aim for his head.

158
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:59,140
So I... I shot him like he said... I aimed for his head like he told me... Why did you

159
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,900
save him?

160
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,520
If you hadn't saved him, Mom and Dad would still be alive! You wouldn't have killed them!

161
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,580
Why did you have to save him?

162
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,460
Stay here. I'm going to the police.

163
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,660
If those detectives last night were real,

164
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,640
it means that some members of the police force are linked to Johan.

165
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,200
If so, we can't just wait here like this.

166
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,380
"Nina, I need you to listen to me.

167
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,220
I know that Johan is going to come after you.

168
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,660
If anyone comes looking for you, just hide.

169
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,880
Why don't you have some food, drink some hot coffee, and then try to get a couple hours

170
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,480
of rest.

171
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,460
One step at a time, that's how we'll get through all this.

172
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,220
You're alive.

173
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,940
You must think about the future, your future.

174
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,180
Were there any clues left by the killer?

175
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,980
Is there any connection to the serial murders throughout Germany?

176
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,280
Chief, Chief, one question.

177
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,480
Like I said, we're doing everything we can to investigate this case,

178
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,820
but I can't make any comments or talk about details.

179
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,560
Chief, we've learned that the 14-year-old had a daughter.

180
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,100
Are you able to tell us where she is at this time, or is she presumed dead as well?

181
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,900
We're trying to figure out her whereabouts.

182
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,160
reporter with them. Mr. Mauer. Chief, one question. And who was that Japanese man who

183
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,600
is said to have been with him? One more question, sir. Japanese? Who is he? He sounds suspicious.

184
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,620
Quick question, Chief. Is this murder at all related to the one that took place

185
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,960
at Heidelberg Castle around the same time? Heidelberg Castle?

186
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,300
So he was killed, too. Chief, we gotta have something. One more.

187
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,060
That's all for now. We'll release additional details in due time.

188
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,980
Please let me through

189
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:16,880
Excuse me, sir, of course, we appreciate all the support we're getting from Mannheim like detectives Messner and Mueller

190
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,020
Thank you both for coming out this afternoon

191
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,320
We're at your disposal to aid in the investigation anything we can do to help

192
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,160
So, how are things coming along sir?

193
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,240
Please come inside that way. We'll be able to speak freely

194
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,300
Chief, can you tell me...

195
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,280
Could you give me an interview?

196
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,900
Chief, just one more question, really quick.

197
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,800
One more question.

198
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,140
They're real.

199
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,680
Those guys were with the police.

200
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,800
They're actual cops.

201
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,000
What should I do?

202
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,740
Hello, Heidelberg Post.

203
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,280
What?

204
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,760
I can't hear you.

205
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,320
We're really busy in here.

206
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,040
Just buy that Japanese guy.

207
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Who did you say you were?

208
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,960
He was with Maurer.

209
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,100
He's the key.

210
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,620
I'm bringing an important witness to your office at five o'clock, but you must not tell the police

211
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:25,360
If I can't trust the police then the newspaper is my only option only they can help me now

212
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,220
Mr. Maurer.

213
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,940
I'm sorry, but you just can't come in here without permission.

214
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,180
He's right. Besides, the BKA is only working on the serial murders of the middle-aged couples.

215
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,440
All that you're going to find in this room is material for the murder at the castle, Inspector Lungay.

216
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,900
Uh, sir?

217
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,240
Please forgive me. I was just a bit curious.

218
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,480
But the crime you're investigating and this one happened at the same time, detective.

219
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,800
I mean, it couldn't have been the same murderer.

220
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,360
So, I see. It appears that this man had been tied up.

221
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,260
You didn't happen to find a rope or anything nearby, did you?

222
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,640
No. Seems the body had already been untied by the time the police arrived on the scene.

223
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,360
I see. Yes.

224
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,280
There are four possible routes of escape from the scene.

225
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,960
He also had to stay well out of sight.

226
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,660
How crowded was the area where he'd come out?

227
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,860
And how much light was there?

228
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,360
Huh?

229
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,260
Here it is.

230
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,100
- Nina, it's me, Tenma, I'm back.

231
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,820
Nina, you can come out now, it's all right.

232
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,520
Hey, Nina?

233
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,540
Oh, no.

234
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,020
Nina!

235
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,880
Nina!

236
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,880
Where are you?

237
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,660
Nina!

238
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,260
He came for you, didn't he, Nina?

239
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,180
I never should have left you here all alone.

240
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,860
Dr. Tenma, I don't blame you for saving my brother's life anymore.

241
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,100
You did what you had to do as a doctor.

242
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
It wasn't your fault.

243
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,180
Please eat the sandwiches...

244
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,420
and get some rest, too.

245
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,520
Please live on...

246
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,160
and continue to save as many people as you are able to.

247
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,660
Nina Fortner.

248
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,580
[sobbing]

249
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,020
Nina, what are you planning to do?

250
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,540
Are you going to kill your brother a second time?

251
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,200
I did it.

252
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,760
I brought him back to life.

253
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,640
That monster.

254
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,960
It was me.

255
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,400
[roaring]

256
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I brought him back to life.

257
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,760
(dramatic music)

258
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,680
(gentle music)
