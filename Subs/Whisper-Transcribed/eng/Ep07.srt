Back then.

25
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,360
I killed him, but now he's...

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:49,620
I know I killed him I did I killed him on that day I know I'm sure I killed my brother

27
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,620
It was me.

28
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,600
I was the one who brought your brother back to life.

29
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,900
It's dead. The phone line has been cut.

30
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,200
We're getting out of here.

31
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,420
He'll be coming back for you.

32
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:43,560
You okay in there?

33
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,140
We're with the police.

34
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,280
Someone called earlier. Is there any trouble?

35
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,080
If you don't mind, sir,

36
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,360
we're just gonna have a quick look around.

37
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,180
Good Lord, this is horrible.

38
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,540
You two all right?

39
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,920
Are you injured? You hurt?

40
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,460
Well, that's a relief.

41
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,400
Backups should arrive very soon.

42
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,220
They'll take care of the crime scene,

43
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,380
and we'll take you over to headquarters for questioning

44
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,060
so we can file a report on this.

45
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,040
So, are you the daughter of the victims?

46
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,640
I'm sorry for your loss.

47
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,260
I'm assuming neither of you saw the intruder, then?

48
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,580
To think something like that could happen in such a peaceful town.

49
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,240
Pardon my asking, sir, but where do you come from? Are you Chinese?

50
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,600
No, sir, I'm Japanese. My name is Kenzo Tenma.

51
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,860
Okay, you're Japanese, yeah.

52
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,860
Well, seems to me you're quite a ways from home, then, aren't you?

53
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,940
You're all right now. It's going to be okay.

54
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,420
Sorry, but can you tell me where we're headed, officer?

55
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,260
The police station, remember?

56
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,580
But wait, I don't understand. The Heidelberg police station is in town.

57
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,840
Yeah, but we're from the station in Mannheim, the next town over.

58
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why?

59
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why are they taking us so far?

60
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, we're almost there. Just another 15 minutes or so.

61
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Uh, okay.

62
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He said they got a call.

63
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They came because they got a call.

64
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But who could have called?

65
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The phone was dead.

66
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,620
There were no sirens when they first came, and they took us away before making sure that backup arrived at the scene.

67
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:12,320
But those badges... those badges did look real.

68
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,480
Blood.

69
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,180
No way.

70
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,420
It can't be.

71
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,960
Could these men have...

72
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,580
Uh, excuse me.

73
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,680
Huh?

74
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,840
A police checkpoint.

75
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,500
thank goodness we're searching for a hit-and-run suspect so please be alert

76
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,160
excuse me it's you well if it isn't detective Messner detective Mueller good

77
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:18,800
evening to you gentlemen are you two on your way back to the station I'm sure

78
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,880
we'll get it banged up soon enough yeah we really give our rides a workout

79
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,000
excuse me detective she's not feeling so well back here can she get some fresh

80
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000

81
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,040
say detective what's up are these two in some kind of trouble trouble not at all

82
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:51,140
it's nothing don't worry what's going on here they seem like real detectives but

83
00:10:51,140 --> 00:11:01,840
What about that blood? Who could have called them? Their sirens weren't even on. What should we do? What?

84
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,180
Hey, what's wrong, Dr. Tenma? Are you two okay?

85
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,460
How?

86
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,420
How do you know who I am?

87
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,540
I gave you my name, but I never told you not once that I was a doctor

88
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,540
Tell me, how did you know that?

89
00:11:46,420 --> 00:12:15,840
I found a grocery store nearby.

90
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,260
I also got you some dry clothes.

91
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,640
There's bread, sausage, and cheese.

92
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,760
And I filled this thermos up with hot coffee, too.

93
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,400
You probably don't have much of an appetite, but you really should eat.

94
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,140
You're shivering.

95
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,300
- Yeah, you should change out of those wet clothes.

96
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,440
- A lot of people were dead.

97
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,280
- Uh-huh.

98
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,120
- My brother and I were walking.

99
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,460
It was like we were all alone in the world.

100
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,280
Where were you when all of this happened? Can you remember anything else?

101
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:32,640
We crossed the border. Uncle and Auntie helped us. They were so kind to us.

102
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,160
Then my brother said, I have a good plan.

103
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:46,580
soon after that my uncle and my dear auntie were both dead

104
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:57,740
anyone who was ever good to us died without fail all of them but then one day

105
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,480
one day i discovered the reason why that rainy day

106
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:10,640
you're talking about the incident with mr. and mrs. Liebert my brother did it

107
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:21,680
he shot them my brother he he murdered them he's the one who did all this my

108
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:31,520
brother murdered them all so I picked up the gun with both my hands and then night

109
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:38,080
I... I aimed it right at my brother, and that's when he said it. He was smiling.

110
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,700
After you shoot me, make sure that you throw the gun out the window.

111
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,740
And he told me to aim for his head.

112
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
So I... I shot him like he said.

113
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,400
I... I aimed for his head like he told me.

114
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,900
Why did you save him?

115
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:11,520
If you hadn't saved him, Mom and Dad would still be alive.

116
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,540
You wouldn't have killed them.

117
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,560
Why did you have to save them?

118
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,460
Stay here. I'm going to the police.

119
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:35,620
If those detectives last night were real, it means that some members of the police force are linked to Johan.

120
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,220
If so, we can't just wait here like this.

121
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,380
Nina, I need you to listen to me.

122
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,220
I know that Johan is going to come after you.

123
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,660
If anyone comes looking for you, just hide.

124
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,460
Why don't you have some food, drink some hot coffee, and then try to get a couple hours of rest?

125
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,460
One step at a time. That's how we'll get through all this.

126
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,220
You're alive.

127
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,940
You must think about the future.

128
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,880
Your future.

129
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,180
Were there any clues left by the killer?

130
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,980
Is there any connection to the serial murders throughout Germany?

131
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,360
Chief, chief, one question.

132
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,300
Excuse me, chief, just one more question.

133
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,500
Like I said, we're doing everything we can to investigate this case,

134
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,820
but I can't make any comments or talk about details.

135
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,560
Chief, we learned that the 14-year-old had a daughter.

136
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,100
Are you able to tell us where she is at this time, or is she presumed dead as well?

137
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,900
We're trying to figure out her whereabouts.

138
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,080
Why was that newspaper reporter with them?

139
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,840
Mr. Maurer.

140
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,580
Chief, chief, one question.

141
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,020
And who was that Japanese man who is said to have been with him?

142
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,880
Excuse me, chief, there's one more question.

143
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,400
One more question, sir.

144
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:40,620
Over here.

145
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,280
Japanese?

146
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,640
Who is he?

147
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,600
He sounds suspicious.

148
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,220
Quick question, chief.

149
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,520
Is this murder at all related to the one that took place at Heidelberg Castle around the same time?

150
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,960
Heidelberg Castle?

151
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,080
So he was killed too.

152
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,820
Chief, we've got to have something.

153
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,060
That's all for now. We'll release additional details in due time.

154
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,880
Excuse me. Please, let me through.

155
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,040
Chief, I'm sorry. One more question.

156
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,020
Excuse me, sir.

157
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,860
Of course. We appreciate all the support we're getting from Mannheim, like Detectives Mesner and Mueller.

158
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,020
Thank you both for coming out this afternoon.

159
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,240
We're at your disposal to aid in the investigation. Anything we can do to help.

160
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,140
So how are things coming along, sir?

161
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,240
Please come inside. That way we'll be able to speak freely.

162
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,140
They're real.

163
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,820
Those guys were with the police. They're actual cops.

164
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,000
What should I do?

165
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,740

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,480
If I can't trust the police, then the newspaper is my only option.

171
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,440
Only they can help Nina now.

172
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,120
Mr. Maurer.

173
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,940
I'm sorry, but you just can't come in here without permission.

174
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,880
He's right.

175
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,180
Besides, the BKA is only working on the serial murders of the middle-aged couples.

176
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,460
All that you're going to find in this room is material for the murder at the castle, Inspector Lungay.

177
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,880
Uh, sir?

178
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,240
Please forgive me. I was just a bit curious.

179
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,440
But the crime you're investigating and this one happened at the same time, Detective.

180
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,820
I mean, it couldn't have been the same murderer.

181
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,080
So I see.

182
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,380
It appears that this man had been tied up.

183
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,260
You didn't happen to find a rope or anything nearby, did you?

184
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,640
No. Seems the body had already been untied by the time the police arrived on the scene.

185
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,360
I see. Yes.

186
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,280
There are four possible routes of escape from the scene.

187
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,960
He also had to stay well out of sight.

188
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,640
How crowded was the area where he'd come out?

189
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,840
And how much light was there?

190
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,360
Huh?

191
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,280
Here it is.

192
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:20,520
Nina, it's me, Tenma. I'm back. Nina, you can come out now. It's all right. Hey, Nina?

193
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:34,680
Oh, no. Nina! Nina! Where are you? Nina!

194
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,260
He came for you, didn't he, Nina?

195
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,140
I never should have left you here all alone.

196
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,460
Huh?

197
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:16,020
Dr. Tenma

198
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,840
I don't blame you for saving my brother's life anymore

199
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,120
You did what you had to do as a doctor

200
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,700
It wasn't your fault

201
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,840
Please eat the sandwiches

202
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,460
And get some rest too

203
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,860
Please live on

204
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,120
and continue to save as many people as you are able to.

205
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,680
Nina Fortner.

206
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,880
Nina.

207
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,040
What are you planning to do?

208
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,560
Are you going to kill your brother a second time?

209
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,240
I did it.

210
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,740
I brought him back to life.

211
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,640
That monster.

212
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,980
It was me.

213
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,280
I brought him back to life.
