He really tore into you back at the mansion, didn't he?

Don't mope, Carl.

15
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,960
Business majors should have thicker skin than that.

16
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,600
Huh?

17
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,940
Uh, I'm sorry, but do I know you?

18
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,140
I'm Lota Frank, a cultural anthropology major.

19
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,120
I'm guessing you work for him, too.

20
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,680
Are you another one of his part-time student readers?

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,600
No, I'm more of a housekeeper, whatever needs doing.

22
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,460
He only lets boys do the reading, as I'm sure you already know.

23
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,040
Anyway, he's got a different reader each day of the week.

24
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,000
Your Tuesdays, of course.

25
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,580
Hey, so what do you think of our boss, anyway?

26
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,120
The ever-mysterious Hans-Georg Schuval, reclusive tycoon?

27
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,660
Uh, beats me.

28
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,300
I was looking for work and the money was good.

29
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,120
Honestly, that's all I needed to know.

30
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,700
Wait, are you saying you've never heard the rumors about him?

31
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,240
He works the stock market like a marionette.

32
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,980
One phone call from him leaves banks across Germany quaking in their boots.

33
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,120
They call him the Howard Hughes of Bavaria.

34
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,400
He has no family, no close friends.

35
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,560
It's just him and his money.

36
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,200
His fortune keeps growing and growing every year.

37
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,560
What on earth does he spend it on anyway?

38
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,600
Who knows?

39
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,260
I didn't even get to the weird part yet.

40
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,700
Schuwalt's other nickname is the Vampire of Bavaria.

41
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,920
How come?

42
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,760
Just as the clock strikes 2 a.m., Schuwalt's manservant loads him into a car,

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,400
like a hearse, and whisks him off into the night.

44
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,060
I've seen it myself. It's like something out of a horror movie.

45
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,140
Maybe he's getting some air.

46
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,520
I'll find out soon enough what old Schuwald's up to.

47
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,760
What do you mean you're going to find out?

48
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,120
It's for my research paper, silly.

49
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,420
Mental Activities of Medieval and Present-Day Financial Figures of Bavaria.

50
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,360
I lucked out. Schuwald's a goldmine.

51
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,740
So you lucked me up because he yelled at me, is that it?

52
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,720
Just your name and your major. I'm not a snoop.

53
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,040
Anyway, I wouldn't lose any sleep over him chewing you out.

54
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,080
He yells at all the guys who read to him.

55
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,840
Yeah. Well, I guess it's a good thing I'm used to getting yelled at.

56
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,680
What do you mean?

57
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,060
Uh, it's just, I spent a lot of time in foster homes. Some of them weren't so nice.

58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,580
Oh, so that's why there's no record of you at any of the local high schools.

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,100
You looked up more than my major and name.

60
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,100
That's gotta be rough, growing up without your real parents like that.

61
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,560
The truth is, I came to Munich for school because I thought maybe I could find my mother.

62
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,460
She's here in Munich? That's great! Have you seen her yet?

63
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,200
No. It wasn't meant to be.

64
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,780
Huh? What do you mean? You can't just throw in the towel.

65
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,980
Hey, you don't happen to know your mom's name?

66
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,480
Uh-huh.

67
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,180
Well, go ahead.

68
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,680
It wasn't meant to be, okay?

69
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,700
Come on, tell me! If you don't, we both know I'm gonna look her up anyway.

70
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,740
Margot. Her name is Margot Langer.

71
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,180
silly you have her full name and you were ready to give up like that finder

72
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:04,920

77
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,740
i'm so sorry for your loss i already said that it doesn't matter didn't i

78
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,100
Well, listen.

79
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,900
Carl, if there's anything I can do, just ask me.

80
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,960
That's sweet of you, but I'm fine.

81
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Carl, I...

82
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,940
Hey, Lotte.

83
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,860
You said you wanted to figure out where Schuwald goes at night.

84
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,980
You're going to follow him, right?

85
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:05,940
Huh?

86
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,460
Would you mind if I came along for the ride?

87
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,220
No, not at all.

88
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,200
Sure does beat sneaking through the darkness by myself.

89
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,840

of the founders of our school wrote this poem in the year 1502 that much we

92
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,140

years left in this century are this year and the year 2000 yeah he will arrive

99
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,900
upon the land and the books shall go up in flames the part about the books in

100
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,420

101

106
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,060
Some vampire of Bavaria he is. We've gone through all this trouble to figure out

107
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,280
what the great big mystery was. And this is what we find out.

108
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Quiet. There he goes.

109
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:15,520
well that was stupid I'm out of here okay be careful Carl I want to see what

110
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,720
he was up to what do you think he was up to

111
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:32,420
hey maybe this isn't such a good idea you're probably right this is no place

112
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,820
for a girl you should go home only beautiful things are deserving of my

113
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:50,860
love yeah I need to know I need to know how miserable of a man he really is yeah

114
00:09:50,860 --> 00:10:02,740
it's open if you're looking for some fun you came knocking on the wrong door I

115
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,660
I got out of the business a long time ago, kid.

116
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,920
Who are you?

117
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,840
Nice manners, kid. You want my name? Shouldn't we start with yours?

118
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,940
Margot Langer. Pleasure's all mine.

119
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,340
I bet you're students from the university, aren't you?

120
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,520
Uh, right. And both of us have part-time jobs working for Hans Schuwalt.

121
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,240
Congratulations. What do you want?

122
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,140
Tell me why.

123
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,620
Why does he come here to see you in the middle of the night like he does?

124
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,120
It's simple, kid. I make him feel better.

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,760
But not in the way you're thinking.

126
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,380
Just because he's up at this hour

127
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,460
doesn't mean he's up at this hour if you catch my drift.

128
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,400
He brings me money, scads of it.

129
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,540
And why shouldn't he?

130
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,560
When I finally went to Schuwald and told him who I was,

131
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,400
He broke down crying and apologized on the spot.

132
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,000
I had his son, and he threw me out on the street like I was a piece of trash.

133
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,520
Wait, so you're...

134
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,000
Carl, is she saying that you're Hans Schuwald's son?

135
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,860
How would you know?

136
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,900
You liar. How dare you?

137
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,920
How dare you pretend to be Margot Langer?

138
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,340
Yeah, the real one was all over the papers a year ago.

139
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,240
Former prostitute Margo...

140
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,800
Former prostitute Margo Langer murdered.

141
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Police say killer still at large the woman you call yourself is already dead. How could any human being stoop so low?

142
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,400
You're using my dead mother's name to guilt Shoevald out of his money, and he's falling for it

143
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Shoevald knows the score oh

144
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,060
He knows I'm not the real thing

145
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:55,040
But he still gives me money hand over fist all the money in the world can't buy him forgiveness from the real

146
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,920
Margo Langer. That ship has sailed. Guess paying a stand-in's the next best thing.

147
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,780
Money, money, money! That's all the bastard's been living for, and the only

148
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:13,580
way he knows how to say sorry. Don't look so teary-eyed, kid. You know Saint

149
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:19,700
yourself. You and I both know Shuvald's on his way out. Take a good look at him.

150
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,600
If you're gonna play the long-lost sun card, better do it while he can change

151
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,840
his will what are you implying you're giving me grief for being an imposter but you didn't

152
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:36,960
exactly waltz in here with a positive paternity test just watch out for the competition boy you're

153
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,040
not the only one who says he's schuvald's son huh yeah he came to see me a little while back

154
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:53,280
told me the same sob story you did no way it can't be carl's telling you the truth the other guy's

155
00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:01,680
the liar excuse me if i don't take your word for it for the record i think you're both full of it

156
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,600
so this other guy who is he another student a bunch of you take turns reading books to

157
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,360
schuvald a different boy every day of the week ain't that right you've got that in common carl

158
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,400
yes sir i think he's uh-huh he's the thursday boy

159
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:28,640
you could have insisted a little harder that you're his real son what's the point i was passed

160
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,480
along from foster home to foster home for most of my life usually sending me from bad to worse

161
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,620
but i finally ended up with a couple who loved me as though i were their very own

162
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,420
they're everything i ever could have wanted but their being so wonderful made me want to meet my

163
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,740
biological father even more. I thought that if I could see what a sad little

164
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,940
man he was with my own eyes, I could finally return my foster parents' love.

165
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,800
That's all I was trying to do.

166
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,700
Hey Lotte, tell me something. Have you ever seen this Thursday boy?

167
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,420
That's one day of the week I always have off from work. But this one Thursday I

168
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,120
I went in to grab something I'd forgotten.

169
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,820
- And he was there reading, right?

170
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,320
Tell me what he looked like.

171
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,920
- Let me think.

172
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,000
I wanna say he had blonde hair and a very beautiful face.

173
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,740
- Shufalt's Thursday boy.

174
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,020
Who is he?

175
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,540
Someone in this university is pretending to be me.

176
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,980
Carl, are you listening to me? This is important.

177
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,900
Take this money and ride the train on track number five.

178
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,040
Get off at the eighth station. A lady named Marta will be waiting.

179
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,080
What about you, Mom?

180
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,040
Honey, I already told you I can't go with you.

181
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
But how come? Are you in trouble?

182
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,560
I don't want to go alone, Mom.

183
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,460
You have no choice. If you stay with me, they'll cart you off to some orphanage.

184
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,900
Around here, people will mock you as the son of a whore.

185
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:21,100
now go on what about my dad can't my dad make it better somehow his name is hans georg schubert

186
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:27,640
isn't it who told you that old mrs bella from across the street my dad's rich isn't he

187
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,140
she said he abandoned us how come you would do something like that

188
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:42,400
he didn't abandon us Carl then I'll just go where he is and you can find us there

189
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:50,500
no you can't so when can I see him Oh Carl when you're all grown up you can meet your

190
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:57,960
father if you want don't hate him if he turns you away please why shouldn't I

191
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Why?

192
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Because Mommy doesn't hate him even now.

193
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Keep this with you always.

194
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,960
It was a gift from your father on the day you were born.

195
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Carl! I know who he is!

196
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
- Earth to Carl!

197
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,960
I know who the Thursday boy is!

198
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,800
- What?

199
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,960
- His name is Edmund Farran.

200
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,460
He's a philosophy major.

201
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,460
I'm sure he's the guy we're looking for.

202
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,300
He reads books to Shoevald at the mansion every Thursday.

203
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,080
- Edmund Farran, huh?

204
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,460
- Get ready.

205
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,260
He should be coming out of that lecture hall any second.

206
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,620
Hey!

207
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,940
You wouldn't happen to know Edmund Farran, would you?

208
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,420
Hmm? Oh.

209
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,140
Hey, guys, is Edmund here?

210
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Who, Edmund Farran?

211
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,840
I think he was a no-show today.

212
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,260
There you go.

213
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,140
Oh.

214
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,120
Okay, so he dodged the bullet today.

215
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,920
But seriously, it's only a matter of time before we give that fraud what's coming to him.

216
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,100
No imposter's gonna cheat you out of Shuvald's inheritance.

217
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,100
It's not about the money.

218
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:25,880
Huh?

219
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,180
I couldn't care less if I see any part of his fortune.

220
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,300
But Carl...

221
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,680
No. If they want to rob Shuvald blind, they can go right ahead.

222
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,020
Who cares?

223
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,280
Then why?

224
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,320
Because... because I can't stand the thought of this bastard Farron pretending to be my mother's son.

225
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,140
There's no forgiving something like that.

226
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:54,880
With the petals of your silk flowers swaying in the breeze

227
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,000
The cry of the mockingbird rang through my heart

228
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,620
You haven't told me to stop reading yet

229
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,000
Why is that, sir?

230
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,820
I berate you all the time

231
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,100
Why do you insist on coming back?

232
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,920
Is the money that good?

233
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,680
That isn't why!

234
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,480
With all due respect, sir, it's nothing like that.

235
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,300
Is money the only incentive to do something in your world?

236
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,700
In my world or any other?

237
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,080
What are they like, your parents?

238
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,260
Actually, I was raised by a series of foster families.

239
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,640
I see. Forgive me for prying. Would you meet your real parents, if you could?

240
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,360
Well, sir, I... Actually, I'm...

241
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,300
Yes, this young man who reads to me just may be the one I've waited for.

242
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,640
He doesn't seem to be after my money.

243
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,240
Who is he?

244
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,080
Never mind. I'm talking to myself. It's time we called it a day, Neumann.

245
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,940
Oh, one more thing.

246
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,760
Regarding your Latin, boy, it is much improved.

247
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,880
Well, thank you very much, sir.

248
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,400
Looks like Edmund Farrin's playing hooky today, too.

249
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,860
Betcha he's laid up in bed with a bad cold or something like that.

250
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,240
Tomorrow's Thursday. He'll be there.

251
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,260
He'll be at the mansion and so will I.

252
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,480
Oh, I get it.

253
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,040
You're gonna bust him as the faker he is right in front of Shoe Vault, right?

254
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,420
That's awesome. Let's go get him already.

255
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,800
Still no sign of him. He was supposed to be here an hour ago.

256
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,880
If he were sick and stuck in bed, at least then we would know where to find him.

257
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,880
Hey! Want to barge into his room and confront him there?

258
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,760
Hold on. Don't tell me you looked up Farin's address.

259
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,780
202 and 204. Jackpot!

260
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,600
Here we go.

261
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,520
Knock.

262
00:20:38,800 --> 00:21:08,780
I'll be right back.

263
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:16,240
It's been so grim around here.

264
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,780
The whole school's talking about what happened to Edmund Farrin.

265
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,180
Who'd have thought he'd kill himself?

266
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,980
The school paper actually printed his suicide note, didn't they?

267
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,160
I can no longer continue to deceive.

268
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,060
So that's what it was about.

269
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,680
I guess so.

270
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,980
Spending all that time with Shuvald, acting like his son.

271
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,980
Maybe the guilt just blindsided him.

272
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,940
If he'd known he was going to grow a conscience,

273
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,400
he'd have been better off not trying in the first place.

274
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,900
Lota, yesterday must have been tough.

275
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,960
Hey, don't you know it.

276
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,260
Since we're the ones who discovered the body,

277
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,380
the police held us for questioning all day.

278
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,260
Well, I didn't end up reading today after all.

279
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,960
Mr. Schuwald is taking the news very hard.

280
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,620
Oh, hey, I'm being rude.

281
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,860
This is Carl. He's the Friday reader.

282
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,160
A pleasure to meet you.

283
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,160
The same here.

284
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm Carl Neumann from the Economics Department.

285
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,260
I'm Johann Liebert.

286
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,440
I study in the School of Law.
