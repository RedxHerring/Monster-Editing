1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:15,500
Oh, Corinna, why are your letters ever, ever so short, as with Eupolis, the scholar of

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,860
the stars, and his, uh, astrology?

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:27,060
You drive my heart mad, and such the gold of ideas, its colors faded while the work

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:27,540
of the artisan--

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,640
Oh, enough already!

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,340
Well, what are you waiting for put the book on the shelf and go if I did something to offend me

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,660
You're offending me right now

8
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,800
I'm not sure what I did to upset you sir

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,920
But I'm sorry nonetheless if you can't wrap your tongue or your brain around Latin

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,820
You're of no use to me as a reader understood. I'm sorry, sir. I'll be more careful. I

11
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,300
Told you to get out

12
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,580
[MUSIC]

13
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,600
He really tore into you back at the mansion, didn't he?

14
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,180
Don't mope, Carl.

15
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,960
Business majors should have thicker skin than that.

16
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,600
Huh?

17
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,940
Uh, I'm sorry, but do I know you?

18
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,120
A cultural anthropology major.

19
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,120
I'm guessing you work for him, too.

20
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,680
Are you another one of his part-time student readers?

21
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,500
No, I'm more of a housekeeper.

22
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,620
Whatever needs doing.

23
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
He only lets boys do the reading,

24
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,460
as I'm sure you already know.

25
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,040
Anyway, he's got a different reader each day of the week.

26
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,000
Your Tuesdays, of course.

27
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,700
Hey, so what do you think of our boss, anyway?

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,040
The ever-mysterious Hans Georg Shuval, reclusive tycoon?

29
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,300
It's me. I was looking for work and the money was good.

30
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,140
Honestly, that's all I needed to know.

31
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,700
Wait, are you saying you've never heard the rumors about him?

32
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,240
He works the stock market like a marionette.

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,960
One phone call from him leaves banks across Germany quaking in their boots.

34
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,100
They call him the Howard Hughes of Bavaria.

35
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,560
He has no family, no close friends. It's just him and his money.

36
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,200
His fortune keeps growing and growing every year.

37
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,540
What on earth does he spend it on anyway?

38
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,600
Who knows?

39
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,700
Shuvalt's other nickname is the Vampire of Bavaria.

40
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,920
How come?

41
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,240
Just as the clock strikes 2 a.m.,

42
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,760
Shuvalt's manservant loads him into a car,

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,420
like a hearse, and whisks him off into the night.

44
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,860
I've seen it myself.

45
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,060
It's like something out of a horror movie.

46
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,120
Maybe he's getting some air.

47
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,520
I'll find out soon enough what old Shuvalt's up to.

48
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,760
What do you mean you're going to find out?

49
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,100
It's for my research paper, silly.

50
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
"Mental Activities of Medieval and Present-Day Financial Figures of Bavaria."

51
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,340
I looked out. Shuvald's a goldmine.

52
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,740
So you looked me up 'cause he yelled at me, is that it?

53
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,720
Just your name and your major. I'm not a snoop.

54
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,040
Anyway, I wouldn't lose any sleep over him chewing you out.

55
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,080
He yells at all the guys who read to him.

56
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,840
Yeah. Well, I guess it's a good thing I'm used to getting yelled at.

57
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,680
What do you mean?

58
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,560
Uh, it's just... I spent a lot of time in foster homes.

59
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,060
Some of them weren't so nice.

60
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,560
Oh, so that's why there's no record of you at any of the local high schools.

61
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,100
You looked up more than my major and name.

62
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,100
That's gotta be rough, growing up without your real parents like that.

63
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,560
The truth is, I came to Munich for school because I thought maybe I could find my mother.

64
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,460
She's here in Munich? That's great! Have you seen her yet?

65
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,480
"No, it wasn't meant to be."

66
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,580
"Huh? What do you mean? You can't just throw in the towel!"

67
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,120
"Hey, you don't happen to know your mom's name?"

68
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,000
"Uh-huh."

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,640
"Well, go ahead."

70
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,080
"It wasn't meant to be, okay?"

71
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,600
"Come on, tell me! If you don't, we both know I'm gonna look her up anyway."

72
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,140
"Margo. Her name is Margo Langer."

73
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,980
Silly you have her full name and you were ready to give up like that find her. What are you waiting for?

74
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,560
No, it's too late for reunions

75
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Here we go Margo Langer, what do we got?

76
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,700
Oh, no

77
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,640
Like a chestnut mare at full stride passion electric

78
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,460
Uh, "Sparking Great Waves."

79
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,920
I can't bear this.

80
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,880
Only beautiful things are deserving of my love.

81
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,460
Your reading pains me.

82
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,900
Why didn't you explain, Carl?

83
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,700
If only I had known.

84
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,020
Now I understand why you gave up looking.

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,360
I'm so sorry for your loss.

86
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,860
I already said that it doesn't matter, didn't I?

87
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,920
Carl, if there's anything I can do, just ask me.

88
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,980
That's sweet of you, but I'm fine.

89
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,300
Carl, I...

90
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,960
Hey, Lotte.

91
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,860
You said you wanted to figure out where Schuwald goes at night.

92
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,980
You're going to follow him, right?

93
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,480
Would you mind if I came along for the ride?

94
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,220
No, not at all.

95
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,220
Sure does beat sneaking through the darkness by myself.

96
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,700
I'm telling you, it's true!

97
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,840
Our Supernatural Phenomena Research Group

98
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,080
has finally hit pay dirt!

99
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,200
There is no way!

100
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,240
In any case, listen up.

101
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,760
Bishop Gropius, one of the founders of our school,

102
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,040
wrote this poem in the year 1502.

103
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,040
That much we already know for sure.

104
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,520
Now, consider the following verse.

105
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,080
"On the second to the last big year,

106
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,040
"the boy of Thursday will arrive upon the land,

107
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,200
"and the book shall go up in flames,

108
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,760
The entire world will be shrouded in sorrow. Crazy, huh?

109
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,280
So it's spooky. What's your point again?

110
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,540
Don't you get it, guys?

111
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,980
Look, it says right here, the second to the last big year.

112
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,520
What year is it? 1996, right?

113
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,600
So that means this is the year.

114
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,920
How do you figure?

115
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,840
Listen, the big year means leap year.

116
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,200
And the only leap years left in this century are this year and the year 2000.

117
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,420
He will arrive upon the land and the book shall go up in flames.

118
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,920
about the books in this land means that this university will go up in flames.

119
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,820
Okay, then. Who's this boy of Thursday, huh?

120
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,700
Thursday. Well, let's see. Donor star comes from the word "donor."

121
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,640
Yeah, and "donor" means "thunder." The god of thunder!

122
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,500
You've lost your damn mind.

123
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,480
Hey, this is going to be the front page story of our next newsletter.

124
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,740
It's no laughing matter.

125
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,100
I'll run the article if it'll make you happy, but come on, nobody's gonna buy this.

126
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,940
A god of destruction coming to our university?

127
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,980
Some vampire of Bavaria he is.

128
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,560
We've gone through all this trouble to figure out what the great big mystery was.

129
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,160
And this is what we find out.

130
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,440
Quiet. There he goes.

131
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,800
Well, that was stupid. I'm out of here.

132
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,100
- Huh? Carl? - I want to see what he was up to.

133
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,760
What do you think he was up to?

134
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,460
Hey, maybe this isn't such a good idea.

135
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,060
You're probably right. This is no place for a girl. You should go home.

136
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,540
Only beautiful things are deserving of my love. And...

137
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,040
Yeah?

138
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,800
I need to know. I need to know how miserable of a man he really is.

139
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,140
Yeah, it's open.

140
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,500
If you're looking for some fun, you came knocking on the wrong door.

141
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,660
I got out of the business a long time ago, kid.

142
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,920
Who are you?

143
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,360
Nice manners, kid. You want my name?

144
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,840
Shouldn't we start with yours?

145
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,980
Margot Langer. Pleasure's all mine.

146
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,360
I bet you're students from the university, aren't you?

147
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,500
Uh, right.

148
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,520
And both of us have part-time jobs working for Hans Schuwalt.

149
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,560
Congratulations.

150
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,240
What do you want?

151
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,160
Tell me why.

152
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,620
Why does he come here to see you in the middle of the night like he does?

153
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,080
I make him feel better.

154
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,760
But not in the way you're thinking.

155
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,380
Just 'cause he's up at this hour,

156
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,500
doesn't mean he's up at this hour if you catch my drift.

157
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,340
He brings me money. Scabs of it.

158
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,900
Huh?

159
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,540
And why shouldn't he?

160
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,560
When I finally went to Shuvald and told him who I was,

161
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,300
he broke down crying and apologized on the spot.

162
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,320
I had his son and he threw me out on the street

163
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
like I was a piece of trash.

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Wait, so you're...

165
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,000
Carl, is she saying that you're Han Shuvald's son?

166
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,880
How would you know?

167
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
You liar! How dare you!

168
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,940
How dare you pretend to be Margot Langer!

169
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,320
Yeah! The real one was all over the papers a year ago!

170
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,300
Former prostitute Margot...

171
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,800
Former prostitute Margot Langer murdered!

172
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,800
Police say killer still at large!

You could have insisted a little harder that you're his real son.

213

215

But I finally ended up with a couple who loved me as though I were their very own.

216

They're everything I ever could have wanted.

217
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,080
But their being so wonderful made me want to meet my biological father even more.

218
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,360
I thought that if I could see what a sad little man he was with my own eyes,

219
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,320
I could finally return my foster parents' love.

220

That's one day of the week I always have off from work.

224

And he was there reading, right?

226
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,780
Let me think. I want to say he had blonde hair and a very beautiful face.

227

346
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,260
Well, I didn't end up reading today after all.

347
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,960
Mr. Schuwald is taking the news very hard.

348
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,620
Oh, hey, I'm being rude.

349
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,880
This is Carl. He's the Friday Reader.

00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,160

351
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,180
- The same here.

352
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm Carl Neumann from the Economics Department.

353
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,280
- I'm Johann Liebert.

354
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,440
I study in the School of Law.

355
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,820

356
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,700
