1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,060
Oh, that mansion. Go right up the street, you should be able to find it.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,580
I appreciate it. Thank you.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,860
You're welcome.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,100
(birds chirping)

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,920
Roses, huh?

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,840
Just like the castle in "Sleeping Beauty."

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,380
(choral music)

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,840
(upbeat music)

9
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,120
"It's Anna.

10
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,240
My name is Anna Liebert.

11
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,520
You go get him, Mr. Detective.

12
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,620
It's because she was worried that something awful might happen to you.

13
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,220
I don't want you to get hurt.

14
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,400
I...

15
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,140
I care about you.

16
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,140
(Hana groaning)

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:32,940
- Hana.

18
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,540
- Were you dreaming just now, Detective Suk?

19
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,960
- Hold on, who are you?

20
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
- Inspector Lunge.

21
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,400
I work out of the German BKA office.

22
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,460
- What do you want with me?

23
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,220
- Calm down.

24
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,040
You don't have to get up, relax.

25
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,340
Nobody sent me to arrest you.

26
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,640
I haven't even met with anyone in your division.

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,000
You've been assigned a very nice room.

28
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,620
I went to several hospitals that had connections to the former Czechoslovakian secret police before finding this one,

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,360
and judging by your excellent care, you must be a pretty important person

30
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,180
to the Czechoslovakian secret police, am I right?

31
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,200
I'm not. Please believe me.

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,420
I know everything you've been up to since you joined the Prague Division.

33
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,080
Inspector Zeman, who had close ties to the secret police, was beaten to death.

34
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,460
The Prague station chief and two detectives were killed with poison whiskey bonbons.

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,760
Two investigators from a special task force who were tailing you were found shot.

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,220
And at the moment, you're being pursued as the most likely suspect in all of these cases.

37
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,840
If you were to be judged on circumstantial evidence alone, then you'd be the murderer.

38
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,920
No, I'm not! I'm completely innocent!

39
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,040
Then what about that thin, lanky fellow named Grimmer

40
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,620
who Inspector Zemon brought in for questioning the day before his murder?

41
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,620
Mr. Grimmer didn't kill anybody either. He's not that kind of person!

42
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,500
So then, who is the killer?

43
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,100
Don't you know him?

44
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,420
Don't you know who the murderer is?

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,760
What is this? What are you talking about?

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,680
If I knew who it was, this wouldn't be happening to me.

47
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,940
My God, so many people have stabbed me in the back.

48
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,820
Now I find myself being framed for murder,

49
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,140
and all the police want to do is lock me up.

50
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,940
I've had enough of this!

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,120
Dammit, I'm so tired of being betrayed!

52
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,880
You're a detective, aren't you?

53
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,320
Act like it.

54
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,960
You have to calmly dissect and scrutinize everything.

55
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,360
Dig up the truth as rationally as you can,

56
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,140
even if you have to sacrifice your own happiness

57
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,560
There is really only one way to prevent yourself from being betrayed.

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,100
All you have to do is doubt the person you believe in the most.

59
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,820
Who the hell said you had permission to be here?

60
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,400
I want a meeting with your boss.

61
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,240
Tell him I want to talk to him about the Red Rose Mansion.

62
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,340
It's safe to say he'll want to meet with me right away.

63
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,580
Inspector Lungay of the BKA.

64
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,300
I ran a background check. Dug up some of your past.

65
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,740
I heard about your past too when the old regime was in power, Captain Lankay.

66
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,000
are for all intents and purposes leader of the Czechoslovakian secret police.

67
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,440
That's quite a position. Seems to be some trouble attached to you at the moment.

68
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,400
Why, thank you for your concern.

69
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,640
I'm envious of people in your position who can take such long vacations.

70
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,460
Two years ago, wasn't it? Your relentless ways drove the secretary of Mr. Boltzmann,

71
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,860
a candidate to lead the German Democratic Party, to suicide.

72
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,660
You have to be a lot smarter than that to move up in the world.

73
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,740
You and your people were quite foolish.

74
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,660
During the democratization,

75
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,000
if you had taken a softer approach and managed your secrecy,

76
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,960
you could have been the ones controlling the president's actions behind the scenes.

77
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,080
However, now the fear that people feel towards you and your men

78
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,200
is merely an illusion with no basis in fact.

79
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,460
So I see, you are quite clever.

80
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,420
You asked to see me. So what does a clever man like you want?

81
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,360
An answer. As you already know, I'm on a long vacation, but it's not entirely just a pleasure trip.

82
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm here looking for something.

83
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,500
I'm looking for an embodiment of true fear.

84
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:11,200
I want to find out if a real demon was born in that illusion that you created during the reign of the old regime.

85
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,160
"Ah, you're referring to the Rose Mansion, aren't you?"

86
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,400
I found it, but before I got there, I wandered around quite a bit.

87
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,960
The man who wrote this picture book years ago used many pen names.

88
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,000
The name he used when he wrote "The Nameless Monster" was Emil Scherbe.

89
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,020
His address was a room in an old building in Prague.

90
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,980
At the moment, someone else is renting that room.

91
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,720
As Klaus Poppe, he lived on a farm, deep in the countryside.

92
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,680
But that place has already been torn down.

93
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,360
The Jakob FarabÃ¤ck name only led me to a rented office.

94
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,900
But you didn't stop there, did you?

95
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,760
You finally arrived at Franz Bonaparta's.

96
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,380
Strange place to live, the Rose Mansion.

97
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,680
Franz Bonaparta.

98
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:15,000
he was. No matter how hard I searched, I wasn't able to turn up anything on him. That could

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,680
only mean one thing, that Bonaparta was one of you. That he's a former member of the Czechoslovakian

100
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,040
secret police. Tell me what it is you want to know. That's simple. I want to know everything

101
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:38,740
you know? I know nothing. However... However? There is something I've consciously been trying

102
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:46,480
to forget. And that is the fact that the Rose Mansion ever existed at all. I've avoided

103
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,520
thinking about it. That's why it still stands there, empty and untouched. All of the political

104
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,580
prisoners who were taken there, as well as the entire research staff, just disappeared

105
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,820
one night. I swear, that's all I know.

106
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,340
What's the reason for the plastered wall?

107
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,700
What wall?

108
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,460
I went in yesterday. There was no sign of anyone setting foot in there. The mansion

109
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,140
was completely unoccupied and looked to have been abandoned for some time.

110
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,560
But, the north wall on the second floor,

111
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,640
it looks like it was coated with plaster as though someone was trying to conceal something.

112
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,560
With your permission, I'd like to tear that wall down.

113
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,620
Captain Lenke, what are you afraid of?

114
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,060
I'm afraid you might die.

115
00:09:52,060 --> 00:10:01,120
If you get any closer, you and I may end up facing an unimaginable experience of true fear.

116
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,480
(grunting)

117
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,320
(grunting)

118
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,680
(guns firing)

119
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,280
[FOOTSTEPS]

120
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,600
(eerie music)

121
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,880
(eerie music)

122
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,260
(engine revving)

123
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,400
- Franz Bonaparta.

124
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,180
Goodness, haven't heard that name in a while.

125
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,860
- Oh, black is just fine, thank you.

126
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,600
What's the matter?

127
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,520
- Well, to tell you the truth,

128
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,620
I'm surprised that a Franz Bonaparte fan

129
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,140
has just suddenly shown up.

130
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,100
- I got your name from the Moravia Publishing Company.

131
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,500
It is my understanding that you were

132
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,600
Mr. Bonaparte's editor for several years.

133
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,300
Is that right, Mr. Zoback?

134
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,180
- It is.

135
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,260
I guided him and helped him as his editor,

136
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,280
but that was only when he was writing

137
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,940
under the pen name Klaus Popper.

138
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,720
I wonder if you can tell me more about him, like what kind of person he was.

139
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,380
He would come here to my home. We would discuss his work and sometimes rewrite sections of it.

140
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,620
Ah yes, he'd sit in that chair in the same position you're in now.

141
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,500
Often he would take a break and play in the garden with my daughter.

142
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,240
I didn't think anything of it at the time, but my daughter said something strange.

143
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,980
She said, "Papa, that man is scary."

144
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,800
Of course, she was very young, and now she's a full-grown adult.

145
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,940
I'm sure she's forgotten all about it.

146
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,380
At that time, could he have possibly been working for a government agency?

147
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,180
Well, probably.

148
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,140
I did assume that, but it was never discussed.

149
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,920
However, there was something about him.

150
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,340
I guess it was his manners, the way he spoke, the clothes he wore,

151
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,900
from the officials of the old regime.

152
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,680
Bonaparta was a practicing psychiatrist

153
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,240
and also a medical doctor.

154
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,900
He specialized in neurosurgery.

155
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,660
Oh, I see.

156
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,180
I'm trying to remember his last visit.

157
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,340
It was the summer of '81 or '82, I believe.

158
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,100
I recall that he just showed up here one day

159
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,060
without any warning.

160
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,280
He wanted to talk about a new book.

161
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,200
Oh my goodness. How happy he appeared to be at the time.

162
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,000
The new book. What was it about?

163
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,220
Well, it was about a monster falling in love.

164
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,920
It was strange. It was almost like a combination of Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty.

165
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,280
Of course, I vetoed it on the spot.

166
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,560
Then, at the door, as he was preparing to say goodbye,

167
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,960
He just stopped and said, "Maybe you'll like this better."

168
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,740
Then he turned to look me in the eye.

169
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,360
"It's a story about a door that must not be opened

170
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,590
under any circumstances."

171
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,500
I asked him if paradise was on the other side

172
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,940
or if a monster would come through the door.

173
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,920
And he said, "No, you can't open the door,

174
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,740
so I guess there's no story."

175
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,480
He laughed when he said that, and then he was gone.

176
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,540
And that was the last time I ever saw him.

177
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,440
So, Dr. Tenma, were you able to find out anything interesting or helpful about Bonaparta?

178
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,060
A little, but not as much as I hoped.

179
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,020
Mr. Grimmer, what are you doing here? Have you been following me around?

180
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,540
Perhaps. I'm just sitting here enjoying the sunny weather. It's nice.

181
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,540
You can say that again.

182
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,520
I knew it was him.

183
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,040
Is this the police department?

184
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,800
My name is Zoback.

185
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,420
I live on Schweig Court in a private residence.

186
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,660
A suspicious man just left my home.

187
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,500
Well, I'm pretty certain he's the primary suspect

188
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
in the serial murders that occurred in Germany.

189
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,660
Yes, he's Japanese.

190
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,380
And he looks like that neurosurgeon, Dr. Tenma.

191
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,680
(eerie music)

192
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,880
- Ethanol.

193
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,440
The smell of disinfectant.

194
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,380
(gun firing)

195
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,080
(grunting)

196
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,060
(gun firing)

197
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,200
(eerie music)

198
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,520
(dramatic music)

199
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,260
- Death.

200
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,920
How many people died here?

201
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,040
10?

202
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,160
Or 20?

203
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,480
I guess a lot more.

204
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,500
(grunting)

205
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,240
(eerie music)

206
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,140
- I've seen that woman before.

207
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,560
She's the one from the sketchbook.

208
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,140
Could she be the mother of the twins?

209
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,160
Hurry up, or the older boys will take over the field first!

210
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,220
Come on, Milosh! Hurry up!

211
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,880
I am hurrying!

212
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,080
Go! Launch a counter-attack!

213
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,680
Uh-oh!

214
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,900
Fall back! No one's defending the goal!

215
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,680
Oh no, we're gonna score!

216
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,680
Hey! Huh?

217
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,920
Milosh!

218
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,620
Oh man, are you alright?

219
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,520
- Hey, really nice save, MiloÅ¡! - You defended a goal! Good job, MiloÅ¡!

220
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,340
Huh?

221
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,100
He seems to be happy. He's all right now, isn't he?

222
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,040
Well, Dr. Tenma, what do you think?

223
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,440
He's fine.

224
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,180
[footsteps]

225
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,180
Mr. Grimmer, wait up.

226
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,360
Don't you want to spend some time with Milos and the other children?

227
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,700
[footsteps]

228
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,260
I suddenly realized why I'm not really all that good at soccer.

229
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,800
I guess it has to do with playing as a team.

230
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,220
I'm just thinking about what lies ahead for Detective Suk.

231
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,540
He's the prime suspect in a murder,

232
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,300
His future is pretty much washed up as well. It's sad.

233
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,920
Even if he were to turn himself in, how's he going to be able to prove that he's innocent?

234
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,600
And how is he going to find any evidence to verify that the blonde lady I saw leaving his place even exists?

235
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,320
Suke's in a similar situation to the one you're in.

236
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,360
Except for him, there's one big difference.

237
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,180
What?

238
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,220
Time for us to say goodbye, Dr. Tenma.

239
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,780
Only one person knows it all.

240
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,340
everything concerning the events incriminating Detective Suk.

241
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,600
You're looking at him.

242
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,000
Here, give it a read.

243
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,200
I think the police will be very interested when they get it.

244
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,440
What is this?

245
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,320
Just a letter written by the perpetrator of the recent series of killings.

246
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,280
I even mentioned details the police haven't released.

247
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,540
I think it'll make a very compelling case for my being the real murderer.

248
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,840
What? If you send something like this to the police, you'll be arrested!

249
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,660
Ah, but before that can happen, Grimmer will suddenly disappear.

250
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,660
The police will be swift, but Grimmer will have already made his brilliant escape to Germany, say.

251
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,740
After all, he used to be a pretty good spy who could slip his way out of tight spots.

252
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,600
Think about it. You'll have no life. You'll be forced to live on the run!

253
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,600
I'll be fine.

254
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:07,600
"The truth of the matter is, Grimmer never really existed in the first place. It's not who I am. It's just a name I was arbitrarily assigned one day. So even if Grimmer is a suspect for the rest of his life, the real me is unaffected."

255
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,240
"Well, anyway, what do you think of my letter? Do you think the police will buy it?"

256
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,740
"Uh, never mind."

257
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,920
"I guess now you'll be heading off to that Rose Mansion, am I right?"

258
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,240
- That's right.

259
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,240
- You're almost at the finish line.

260
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,300
Your search might be coming to an end any minute.

261
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,220
- I don't know.

262
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,540
I can't be sure.

263
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,120
- Even if I tell you not to do anything rash,

264
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,300
I suppose you won't listen.

265
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,380
Just be careful.

266
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,680
- Mr. Grimmer, remember what you said

267
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,160
when we parted at the Czech border?

268
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,320
Let's have a picnic when we meet again.

269
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,060
We'll fish for rainbow trout on a beautiful day,

270
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,380
and have good wine and cheese.

271
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,020
I'm holding you to that.

272
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,780
Hmph. For the rest of my natural life, that sound is going to haunt me at every turn.

273
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,560
Come on, slowpoke! Hurry up! You want to be late!

274
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,960
I hurt my knee! It's bleeding a lot! It really hurts!

275
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,560
Don't be scared. Let me just see if you can move it.

276
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,580
It's only a scrape, but I'll put some antiseptic on it so it doesn't get infected.

277
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,620
Tough it out. You're a big boy. You can handle it.

278
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,920
That's better. You're very brave.

279
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,460
You're Kenzo Tenma, is that correct?

280
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,520
Prague Police, we have orders to take you to the station.
