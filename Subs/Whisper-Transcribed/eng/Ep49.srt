1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,080
Bad boy, you're such a troublemaker.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,980
How many times are you going to pretend to run away from here?

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,700
You do that again, and you'll get no dinner, understand, Miloš?

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,660
All right.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,380
You get your hands out of your pockets when you talk to me.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,560
Okay.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,660
You really mean it?

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,800
Yeah, it was that blonde lady.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,540
So you said you saw her walking on Dominican Street, that right?

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,440
It could be that she lives on that street.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,340
Yeah, so why didn't you follow her all the way home and find out?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,700
Her stomach was growling like a tiger!

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,080
Here's the deal, guys.

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,740
It's up to us to go find out where that blonde lady lives and turn her in to the police.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,260
Yeah. Mr. Grimmer didn't kill Mr. Pedrov.

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,640
We've got to prove his innocence.

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,860
Prove his innocence?

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,220
If we can do that, will it save Mr. Grimmer?

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,020
Sure. We're figuring out how to do that right now.

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,300
Come on, Meemosh. Hurry up and eat your food.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,520
[Groan]

22
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,140
[Gasp]

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,480
(eerie music)

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,720
(choral music)

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,440
(upbeat music)

26
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,260
(dramatic music)

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,520
- The first incident occurred right up there.

28
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,920
Petrov's illegal orphanage was in this building.

29
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,180
Someone went up there and shot down

30
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,960
the former 511 Kinderheim director in cold blood.

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,620
lived there said that a blonde woman walked past them right after it happened.

32
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,580
Pedrov was continuing his experiment here, but he did the complete opposite of what was

33
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,280
done at 511 Kinderheim. Instead of mental abuse, the children here were raised with

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,040
love. So tell me, you want to go in and take a look? The police have probably already carded

35
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,540
away everything in terms of evidence.

36
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,220
Wait, what are those on the door?

37
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,860
Mr. Officers, Mr. Grimmer is innocent.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,620
Mr. Detectives, the blonde woman is the murderer.

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,100
It's those orphans.

40
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,180
The children who used to live here

41
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,520
must have come back and posted these notes on the door.

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,100
From Mr. Grimmer.

43
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,800
Milan Bocek.

44
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,720
It's a famous soccer player's trading card.

45
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,120
Those boys, that card is priceless.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,600
- So, how should I react to this?

47
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,980
I mean, what kind of expression

48
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,660
should I make in this situation?

49
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,260
All of my emotions were taken from me at 511 Kinderheim.

50
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,100
After that, I had to attend another school

51
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,360
where I was taught what were

52
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,180
appropriate emotional responses.

53
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,920
Situations like this are very difficult for me.

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,820
What's the correct way to react to this gift?

55
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,740
Perhaps you should go and pay those children a visit.

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,640
So, you're Mr. Grimmer.

57
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,740
It seems like I'm always hearing the boys say such nice things about you.

58
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,180
The children are out playing in the neighborhood.

59
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,700
They haven't come back yet.

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,860
They really should be back by now.

61
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,080
Oh, here, look at this.

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,140
Find the children's journal entries, or rather a lot of letters that they've written to you.

63
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,960
"Mr. Grimmer, let's play soccer again."

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,980
"Mr. Grimmer, I'll teach you how to play soccer since you're not very good at it."

65
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,800
"Mr. Grimmer, I can't wait for us to play together again."

66
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,380
Right now, I'm still smiling, aren't I?

67
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
You know, I had to learn how to do this.

68
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,360
I actually had to learn how to put a convincing smile on my face.

69
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,280
I really only spent an afternoon with those boys, yet they have fond memories of that

70
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,400
time I shared with them.

71
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,860
Why do they seem to care about me?

72
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,100
That's because they admire you.

73
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,140
They probably like you.

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,560
They like me?

75
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,060
You know, Doctor, I've never understood these things, not really.

76
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,440
I didn't even know how to react when my own child was dying.

77
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,520
I was asking so many questions of myself.

78
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,860
Should I cry in this situation?

79
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,020
How much should I cry?

80
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,040
Should I wail out loud or gnash my teeth?

81
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,300
Even now, I still don't know how to react to it.

82
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,620
I wish I did.

83
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,900
Mr. Groomer, we need to talk to you!

84
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,500
Antonin, what's going on?

85
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,880
- We got bad news! - What is it? What's wrong?

86
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,120
We just heard something from the kids at Chesky Orphanage! It's terrible!

87
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,160
Just calm down, take a deep breath, and tell me what happened.

88
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,380
They found that blonde lady! We saw that one day!

89
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,960
Yesterday, we all decided to go out and try and find her.

90
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,960
And then, poor Milos...

91
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,300
Well, he's gone! Milos has disappeared!

92
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,560
I see. How interesting.

93
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,600
I'll give you all the people who have come to visit you here.

94
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,980
A certain middle-aged gentleman,

95
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,160
a long-haired Japanese man,

96
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,560
and a tall German man.

97
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,220
That's right.

98
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
There's one more thing.

99
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,060
I think you may have forgotten another person who came to see you.

100
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,040
According to the desk nurse,

101
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,980
a long-haired blonde woman came to visit you recently as well.

102
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,260
A woman?

103
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,080
No, there weren't any women who came to visit.

104
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,720
Well, the nurse said she was certain there was.

105
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,100
She said she was a beautiful blonde.

106
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,760
Yes, she was very beautiful.

107
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,440
But that was definitely a man.

108
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,260
I see.

109
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,420
So tell me, what's your name?

110
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,240
I'm Milosh.

111
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,420
I wonder, have we met somewhere before?

112
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,120
Huh?

113
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,060
Uh-uh.

114
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,320
What were you doing when I saw you?

115
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,900
Nothing.

116
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,020
I know your face. You walk around this neighborhood a lot, don't you?

117
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,120
What is it you're looking for?

118
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,300
I... look for... my mom.

119
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,800
Why don't you have a seat and make yourself comfortable? Here, have some juice.

120
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,920
So, are you about to move out?

121
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,820
Why do you ask?

122
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,220
Because you have that big bag, and there's no stuff in this room.

123
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,340
So your mother, she's somewhere around here?

124
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,020
Huh?

125
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,060
Your mother. You told me you were looking for her, isn't that right?

126
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,780
Yeah, but I don't really know if she lives here.

127
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,080
Then how will you find her? Do you have her picture?

128
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,060
Uh-uh. How come?

129
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,560
Too bad. You don't even know her face.

130
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,020
I'll know her. I'll know my mom when I see her face.

131
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,060
No one at the orphanage believes me either.

132
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,380
They all keep telling me it's not gonna happen.

133
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,600
But when I see her, I'm gonna know her face for sure.

134
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,660
Count on it!

135
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,880
Really?

136
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,420
Yeah. And my mom will know it's me when she sees me.

137
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,020
"Even if you did find your mother, what if she acts like she doesn't know you?"

138
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,160
"Huh?"

139
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,260
"Think you were born because you were wanted?"

140
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,900
"I mean, why were you abandoned?"

141
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,380
"Could it be that your mother left you because she hated you?"

142
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,900
"No way!"

143
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,900
There's nothing special about being born not a thing

144
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,540
Most of the universe is just death nothing more

145
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:32,880
In this universe of ours the birth of a new life on some corner of our planet is nothing but a tiny insignificant flash

146
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,340
Death is a normal thing

147
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,660
So why live?

148
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,660
You think you were wanted

149
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,320
(eerie music)

150
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,380
- Who wanted you?

151
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,380
So what is your reason for living?

152
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,360
Tell me.

153
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,180
- You're asking about a beautiful,

154
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,720
long-haired blonde woman?

155
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,880
Oh, that would be Anna.

156
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,280
- What?

157
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:03,940
Anna?

158
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,280
- So that young woman, Anna,

159
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,640
would you happen to know if she lives in this neighborhood?

160
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,540
- Yeah.

161
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,420
I think Anna lives in a three-story apartment building.

162
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,220
Go down this alley. It should be about two blocks down.

163
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,260
She's a very friendly, nice young lady.

164
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,080
She always says hi to me when she sees me.

165
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,260
Anna? Uh-huh.

166
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,400
She's such a nice girl.

167
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,540
She always has a warm hello and a smile for me.

168
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,920
What's her apartment number and which floor does she live on?

169
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,760
Oh, up there.

170
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,780
That's her apartment window on the top floor.

171
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:48,780
So if what the boys told us earlier is true, and it turns out the woman who lives here actually did kidnap Milos, and she happens to be a young blonde lady named Anna, then she just might be the one...

172
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:58,720
You're right. And if this young blonde woman is the person I think she is, I swear this will end here and now.

173
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,780
Looks like we're too late.

174
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,520
There's no sign of Milos anywhere.

175
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,700
She took him, didn't she, Doctor?

176
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,980
God, he was out actively looking for that blonde woman to try and prove my innocence.

177
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:42,980
"What should I do now? If you know, tell me. How is a person supposed to react to a situation this terrible?"

178
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,980
"Those boys got involved in all this because they were trying to prove my innocence."

179
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:59,160
"You can't blame yourself for everything. The boys told you that Milos usually walks around the streets of Prague. He's always out there searching for his mother."

180
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,860
"He must care for his mother an awful lot."

181
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,400
I don't have feelings like that.

182
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,020
When my son died, I didn't feel anything.

183
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,220
Many years ago, while I was working for a newspaper,

184
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,980
a female coworker suddenly came up to me one day

185
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,100
and told me that she loved me.

186
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,360
I ended up marrying her.

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,680
I'd been told that I'd be less likely

188
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,300
to be suspected of being a spy if I were married.

189
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,860
It'd be a good cover.

190
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,380
Soon she got pregnant.

191
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
She gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

192
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,160
went shopping and left me alone with the baby. My son was in his room taking a nap, and when

193
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,700
I went in to check on him, he was face down and had stopped breathing. I began giving

194
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,460
him CPR right away, and I called the doctor at the same time. I did everything I should

195
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,800
have done to help him. I did it perfectly, but my son died anyway.

196
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:01,920
At my son's funeral, my wife was so angry with me. She said, "How can you stay so calm

197
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,160
Why aren't you crying? Didn't you love him?

198
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,440
You've always been cold like that.

199
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,300
You've never shared your feelings with me, not once.

200
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,340
Look at you, you're a heartless machine, you can't love anyone.

201
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,840
You have nothing in your heart and you have no love for me.

202
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,100
And then my wife left me.

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,800
I have to find Miloš.

204
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,700
You told me that Miloš is the child of a prostitute

205
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,900
who worked in a big red light district near the Czech border, didn't you?

206
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,860
I did.

207
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,120
The blonde woman we're looking for is the person I suspect it is.

208
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,340
I don't think she's going to let Milos live.

209
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,060
What's worse, she won't just kill him quickly.

210
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,280
If this turns out to be who I think it is,

211
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,060
they'll confront Milos with the cruelest thing possible before finishing him off.

212
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,520
Follow this road. It will take you to Germany.

213
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,300
Will I see my mom?

214
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,580
The chances are good. There's a lively town up ahead.

215
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,320
You think that my mom's up there?

216
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,640
I'm going to wait right here for you. You go ahead on your own.

217
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,080
You'll know who your mother is when you see her,

218
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,720
and your mother will know just who you are when she sees you.

219
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,820
But listen, if it should happen that nobody calls out to you,

220
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,520
then that means you aren't wanted by anyone in the world.

221
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,840
What will you do with yourself then?

222
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,040
...

223
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,900
What will you do?

224
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,740
We'll go on, then.

225
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,140
I'm coming, Mom!

226
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,840
(crickets chirping)

227
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,320
- The cruelest thing, God.

228
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,060
(upbeat music)

229
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,100
(upbeat music)

230
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,480
- Thank you, ladies.

231
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,340
Thank you.

232
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,920
What is it, kid?

233
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,620
What do you want?

234
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,420
- I'm looking for someone.

235
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,080
- Well, spit it out.

236
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,920
Who are you looking for?

237
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,560
- My mom.

238
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,560
- Your mom?

239
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,340
That's a good one.

240
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,900
- What's so funny, mister?

241
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,320
- Nothing, no, actually, I know your mom personally.

242
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,100
- What?

243
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,860
You do?

244
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,240
Show me where she is.

245
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,560
- Well, that's hard to do.

246
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,860
There's so many places she could hide.

247
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,320
She could be anyone,

248
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,520
any one of 50 women.

249
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,020
(laughing)

250
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,740
- Oh my God, it's you.

251
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,220
My boy.

252
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,620
It's you.

253
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,440
- Huh?

254
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,740
Who are you, lady?

255
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,400
It's alright now.

256
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,940
Wait, I'm looking for my mom.

257
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,680
I feel so good. Just let me hold you like this.

258
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,640
What do you think you're doing without Brat?

259
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,360
You're acting like he's your kid, so is he?

260
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,420
Of course not.

261
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,440
You know I don't make mistakes that big.

262
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,400
Sure, I guess you got the clap on purpose.

263
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,860
Shut up! You got a problem? Come here, you!

264
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,940
What do you-- hey!

265
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,100
Let go of my hair!

266
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,200
Wait, hold on.

267
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,420
No, not here.

268
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,680
I paid you, didn't I?

269
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,840
I'm the customer.

270
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,420
You do as your customer says.

271
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,100
Let's go get a room, yeah?

272
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,400
Come on, stop!

273
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,640
There's a kid over there!

274
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,400
Oh.

275
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,720
Hang on.

276
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Don't run away yet.

277
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,540
Stay here and watch.

278
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,940
I'm a schoolteacher in Germany.

279
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,520
At school, I have a spotless reputation.

280
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,460
I'm a gentleman, as well as a respected teacher.

281
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,200
Everyone thinks I'm a wonderful teacher.

282
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,140
I am a wonderful teacher!

283
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,440
Here, this is for you.

284
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,080
Think you were born because you were wanted?

285
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,080
Hey, kid. Got cash?

286
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,340
Are you sick, lady?

287
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,600
Yeah. I'm gonna die soon.

288
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,280
Well, why don't you go inside?

289
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,820
I can't. Because I'm dying and I have no money.

290
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,000
Give me some money, please.

291
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
Well, all I have is this.

292
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:17,600
Most of the universe is just death. Nothing more.

293
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,060
You think you were wanted?

294
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Think you were born because you were wanted?

295
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,220
(thunder rumbling)

296
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,280
- I get it now.

297
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,300
I get it now.

298
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
(panting)

299
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,460
- This is it.

00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,500
The district ends here.

301
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,200
I know, but they said they saw Milosh wandering around.

302
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,400
Should we go ahead and turn back?

303
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,300
I mean, he might still be in town, right?

304
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,300
Milosh?

305
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:43,180
Hey Milosh, it's all right. Everything is fine

306
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,020
Hey

307
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,600
Why don't you come back over here, huh?

308
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,840
Did your best you tried to clear my name didn't you?

309
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,960
I'm so lucky to have a friend like you

310
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,500
There's nothing to worry about here we go

311
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,500
It's all right, everything's all right.

312
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,880
Is this good, Dr. Tenma?

313
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,180
Am I doing it right?

314
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,240
Would it have been better if I'd been crying?

315
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,340
They never bothered to teach me such a difficult emotion.

316
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,580
Why did you do that?

317
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:09,520
Milos, what's wrong? What did you see? What happened, Milos? What did you witness? What

318
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:22,320
did you find out tonight? Milos, listen to me. I know that you have no mother, but son,

319
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:30,860
listen, we're definitely born for a reason. I want you to know that. Milos, you were brought

320
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,660
Someone wanted you to be here, definitely.

321
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
Someone definitely wanted you here.

322
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,460
I mean it.

323
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:44,980
Definitely.

325
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,700
Dr. Tenma, I'm telling the truth.

326
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,420
I'm not wrong, am I?

327
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,880
- No, you're not.

328
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,960
- What expression do I have on my face right now?
