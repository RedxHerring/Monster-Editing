1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,900
From here on, we've got to keep a tighter lid on all of this.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,500
Once Sook's gone, things will be as smooth as silk.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,640
My head. I sure could go for a nice drink right about now.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,300
How about a whiskey bonbon instead?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,640
Hey, they're better than nothing. Besides, these were a gift from a real beauty.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,080
What's wrong? You look depressed.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,420
I feel like I can't believe in anything anymore.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,460
Why do you say that? What's wrong?

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,900
I'll help you if you want me to.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,140
I believed in him.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,580
I never would have thought that Inspector Zemon could do such a thing.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,920
What happened?

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,680
I believed in him.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:10,420
Right now, the only person who I really believe in is you.

15
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,660
A TERRIBLY SHOCKING DISCOVERY WAS MADE EARLY THIS MORNING AT THE PRAGUE POLICE STATION.

16
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,100
THREE MEN, HEAD CHIEF HAMRICK, CHIEF DETECTIVE PETELA, AND DETECTIVE JANICZEK WERE FOUND POISONED

17
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,400
TO DEATH IN A CONFERENCE ROOM.

18
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,480
TWO BIG QUESTIONS REMAIN, JUST HOW THESE POLICEMEN WERE POISONED AND WHO WOULD DARE TO COMMIT

19
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,560
SUCH A BRAZEN ACT?

20
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,340
There have been rampant rumors of the Prague police force having ties to the former Czechoslovakian secret police,

21
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,200
but these allegations have never been substantiated.

22
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,440
However, with the murder of these three prominent policemen...

23
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,400
Hey, here comes a cop.

24
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,580
Detective, do you know who the murderer is?

25
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,580
Sir, can you confirm that the drug used to commit these murders was a muscle relaxant?

26
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,460
We've heard rumors that head chief Henrik was somehow linked with the Czech secret police.

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,380
Any truth to that?

28
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,460
Uh, well, I--

29
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,360
Is there any connection between these murders

30
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,560
and last week's killing of Inspector Zayman?

31
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,760
Well, we aren't investigating that.

32
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,060
I mean, we're not ruling out that possibility.

33
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,800
In saying that, do you mean the department strongly believes

34
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,220
that these two incidents are linked?

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,940
No, I-- Right now, the department is pursuing

36
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,480
all possible leads in this investigation.

37
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,040
Sorry, but this detective's not assigned to this case,

38
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,720
and we have no comment right now.

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,120
Suke, you need to button that lip of yours

40
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,980
and get out of here.

41
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,260
- Yes, sir.

42
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,240
- So exactly when are you going

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,300
to make an official statement?

44
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,840
- We will have a news conference

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
when we feel we've gathered enough information,

46
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,120
not a moment before.

47
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,200
(people chattering)

48
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,060
(gentle music)

49
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,560
Why are you here? Have you come back to interrogate them again?

50
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,180
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

51
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,780
Look, I've been given orders to investigate this case starting again at Square One.

52
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,640
This is my last stop.

53
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,540
I've already spoken with all the boys who got placed in other orphanages.

54
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,100
Think of what bringing this up again does to them.

55
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,480
Mr. Pedrov raised all those boys like they were his own children.

56
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,680
Now they have to live the rest of their lives with the image of him and his maid lying there, dead.

57
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,860
Even now, some of them still cry themselves to sleep.

58
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,160
I want to help them forget this as soon as possible.

59
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,100
And yet, that's not something they can just forget about.

60
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,520
Knowing that someone they truly loved has been taken away forever.

61
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,240
Fifteen minutes.

62
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,720
And don't go asking them questions that are too graphic, am I clear?

63
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,740
- Sure, it was lots of fun living with Mr. Pedrov.

64
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,760
Yeah, he and Mrs. Anna were really nice to us all the time.

65
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,520
- I see.

66
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,800
Now, I'd like to talk to you about the day you found them,

67
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,580
if that's okay.

68
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,480
That day you had Mr. Grimmer come to visit.

69
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,760
Had you met him before?

70
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,180
- No, not before then.

71
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,200
- Do you know why he came to visit?

72
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,120
- Uh-uh.

73
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,520
- As they talked, did Mr. Grimmer act friendly

74
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,500
towards Mr. Pedrov?

75
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,160
- Um, come to think of it,

76
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,340
but I didn't understand, they were talking in German.

77
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,940
But you know a few words in German, don't you?

78
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,360
Were there some words you did know?

79
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,060
He was saying that this place was unauthorized

80
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,180
and the police should be told.

81
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,980
So Mr. Grimmer said that?

82
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,060
Yeah. He also said "experiment" and the word "education."

83
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,580
Experiment. Anything else?

84
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,120
What else?

85
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,820
- Tell us if you don't want to, Honza.

86
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,980
- Oh, he said 511 Kinderheim.

87
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,340
- 511 Kinderheim, huh?

88
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,960
Okay.

89
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,720
So Honza, is that a place that you've heard of?

90
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,580
- No, never.

91
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,500
- Do you know it?

92
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,000
- There's no such place in the Czech Republic.

93
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,200
- I see.

94
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,040
So tell me about Mr. Grimmer.

95
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,080
What kind of person is he?

96
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,940
Oh, he's a really nice guy.

97
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,520
So you like him too, Izzy.

98
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
He played soccer with us.

99
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,460
He wasn't really any good at it.

100
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,120
But Mr. Grimmer looked like he was having a lot of fun.

101
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,920
The way he hits his soccer ball is just awful.

102
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,120
He went up for one and fell flat on his butt.

103
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,960
He's probably even worse than Honza.

104
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,680
Really!

105
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,980
The other boys told me you were the leader

106
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,460
at Mr. Petrov's orphanage.

107
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,600
Is that right, Antonin?

108
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,080
I wouldn't say I was really the leader.

109
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,060
- Well, you see, I'm just older than the other guys.

110
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,640
- Now, I'd like to talk to you about that day.

111
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,220
- Is it about Mr. Grimmer?

112
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,020
- Huh?

113
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,980
- One of the guys already told me

114
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,340
that you were asking Honza and Izzy about him.

115
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,520
- Oh, I see.

116
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,200
What do you think?

117
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,320
- I think he's a nice person.

118
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,740
I got a question for you.

119
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,500
Do you think Mr. Grimmer's a suspect?

120
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,680
- No, but we're still investigating.

121
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,920
- Well, Mr. Grimmer isn't the killer.

122
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,420
Mr. Pedroff and Mrs. Anna had already been murdered

123
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,340
by the time we got back home from playing soccer with Mr. Grimmer.

124
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,980
I told the police already, but I think I saw who did it.

125
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,840
As we got back home, I saw this beautiful woman with long blonde hair,

126
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,560
and she was coming out of our house.

127
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,020
Are you trying to catch him?

128
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,300
Catch who?

129
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,240
Mr. Grimmer!

130
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,280
No, but he sure is someone I'd like to have a chat with.

131
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,040
I'm actually going to meet him later on.

132
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,540
I promised him and we already set where we're going to meet.

133
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,000
And would you tell me where that is?

134
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,100
Sure.

135
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,900
You're sure that's alright? Because I might be forced to arrest him.

136
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,660
Well, you don't have to, 'cause there's no way he murdered anyone.

137
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,360
Hey!

138
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,240
Hi!

139
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,960
It's been a little while.

140
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,520
So, are you guys all holding up okay?

141
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,820
Things are a lot better.

142
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,600
You haven't been crying yourselves to sleep, right?

143
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,780
Izzy wet his bed twice!

144
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,760
Well, if the truth be known, I wet my bed until I was a lot older than he is now.

145
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,100
Really?

146
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,580
Hey, Antonin, did you bring that one thing I gave you earlier?

147
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,020
Thank you.

148
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,180
I'm glad you held onto it for me.

149
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,240
See, this is something very important Mr. Pedrov left behind.

150
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,100
- I'm glad you're all okay.

151
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,840
I wish I had more time to share, but I've gotta go.

152
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,020
- Can't you stay and play soccer with us?

153
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,980
- I'm sorry, boys.

154
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,440
I really should be moving on.

155
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,940
- But we're ready to play.

156
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,640
- Those are our new friends.

157
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,160
- Yeah, I can play for a while.

158
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,700
- All right!

159
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,240
- Come on, kick it!

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,420
Come on! I'm open on the right, guys! Pass it to me!

161
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,360
Oh! I got it!

162
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,160
Grimmer going in for the steal!

163
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,000
Max time! Stay on your feet!

164
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,100
That's easier said than done.

165
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,920
Throw in!

166
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,820
You're Mr. Grimmer, aren't you?

167
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,840
Did you come to arrest me?

168
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,480
Don't start waving your gun around.

169
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,200
Come on, there are kids here.

170
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,120
Then I order you to hand over your pistol this instant!

171
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,600
Sorry, I don't have one to hand over.

172
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,800
So you tossed it?

173
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,460
I never had one in the first place.

174
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,420
Tell me, did you kill Inspector Zemon?

175
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,800
I don't know. I can't remember.

176
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,300
I was half-dead from being tortured at the time.

177
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,580
Your nails, they're...

178
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,700
Now, I know it wasn't me who fired the gun,

179
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,360
but I might be responsible for killing the other two.

180
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,780
I passed out before it happened.

181
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,840
Mr. Grimmer!

182
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,220
Why are you up there resting?

183
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,460
Your team stuck playing a man down 'cause you went and took a break!

184
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,280
Sorry about that, guys.

185
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
Hey, I'm old! Cut me some slack!

186
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,880
Okay, you heard him, guys.

187
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,540
Antonin told me that you were planning to meet them to play soccer.

188
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,640
That's how I found you.

189
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,480
You're a person of interest, Mr. Grimmer.

190
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,840
Ah, so what's the verdict?

191
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,300
Am I the murderer you seek?

192
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,880
I don't know.

193
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,640
Over the past few days,

194
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,820
some of the people I deeply trusted betrayed me.

195
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,760
My faith in them was so totally shattered,

196
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,560
I don't know what to believe in anymore.

197
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,620
The only person you can truly believe in is yourself.

198
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,680
You can try to trust other folks,

199
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,300
but sometimes they let you down.

200
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,380
So, we going to the station?

201
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,440
No, just promise you won't leave town, okay?

202
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,340
So, where are you staying for the time being?

203
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,460
At the Pabla Hotel, room 302.

204
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,980
Whenever you decide I am the murderer, feel free to come and get me.

205
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,560
You be sure to hold on to that key.

206
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,700
I think it's the real cause of all these murders you're investigating.

207
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,280
It's to a safety deposit box.

208
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,360
Oh, that sign up there?

209
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,580
Well, it's actually an old relic.

210
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,520
It's a sign for a pub that was established here 200 years ago,

211
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,580
but the Three Frogs Pub has been closed down for ages.

212
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,200
Even though it's old and faded, it's considered a landmark,

213
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,760
It's been through world wars, the fall of communism, and disasters, too.

214
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,240
It's amazing that old thing has survived.

215
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,100
About a decade ago, it even made it through a fire.

216
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:37,800
Really?

217
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,020
Yeah.

218
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,280
This woman with a young kid lived up there on the second floor, right above it.

219
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,060
She sure was a beautiful woman,

220
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,860
but kind of antisocial, hardly ever went out,

221
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,100
and for a good reason.

222
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,360
Seems while she was living there, she was using an alias.

223
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,620
One day, this big official-looking black car came and it took her and the kid away for good.

224
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,860
It was a big deal. We all heard rumors that the woman was arrested for having participated in anti-government activities.

225
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,880
That sort of thing happened all too often in those days. We lived in fear because the government terrorized everyone.

226
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:19,340
It was really quite awful during those final years before the fall of communism. People disappeared all the time.

227
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,620
That woman who got taken away, did she have one child with her, or did she have twins?

228
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,020
No. She only had one child with her, and what a pretty face that kid had.

229
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,640
Was that woman's child a boy or a girl?

230
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,280
Huh. Let me think for a second. Now, which one was it?

231
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,180
Sometimes it's really hard to tell whether they're a boy or a girl when children are that little.

232
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,620
I can't remember.

233
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,600
All I can think about is how they took away that poor, innocent kid with them when they took the mother away.

234
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,020
Right after they left, the fire started.

235
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,060
I ran up there even though I didn't think anyone was around.

236
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,460
Then I got a huge surprise. Her child was in there!

237
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,560
The child must have been released, that's all I can figure.

238
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,280
But I imagine the fire got started when he got hungry

239
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,760
and decided to use the stove to try to cook something.

240
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,960
So where'd he go?

241
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,760
I hate to admit it, but after that fire happened,

242
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,560
I don't know where that young kid went.

243
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,140
I've always wondered what happened to that kid.

244
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,840
What if that child was one of the lady's twins?

245
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,720
Huh?

246
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,480
What if the police took away one child and left the other one up in that room?

247
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,960
Well, if what you just said is right, that might make sense.

248
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,320
But I don't get why you're so sure about the fact that she had twins.

249
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,820
So after questioning the boys, I was able to meet with Grimmer and check him out for myself.

250
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,740
But I really don't think he's the murderer.

251
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,760
I see. Well, I'm just an amateur at crime-solving.

252
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,500
Maybe I'm wrong about him, Mr. Suk.

253
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,400
He's not evil, that much I do know.

254
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,880
Just from us talking, he was able to help me figure out what's really going on.

255
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,540
At first, when Inspector Zemon was found murdered,

256
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,740
I thought it was my duty to avenge his death at any cost.

257
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,080
But then I opened my eyes.

258
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,120
I discovered that Inspector Zemon, a man I looked up to, was a corrupt cop.

259
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,820
for him. But that's all changed. And then after that, the chief and two senior

260
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,860
officers I always reported to wound up poisoned. When I heard that those men

261
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,000
might have been corrupt as well, it shook me to the core. I mean, it's beyond

262
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,940
belief. How far has this terrible darkness spread in the world? Darkness?

263
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,080
Yes, the dark specter of the Czech secret police hangs over all of this. The Czech

264
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,460
secret police worked directly under the former Internal Affairs Office.

265
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,460
They were a brutal force that served as an essential tool of the Soviet Union.

266
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,920
But when democracy came ten years ago, they were disbanded.

267
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,320
Their leaders were put on trial, but some escaped and went underground.

268
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,560
Even now, they're still planning to regain their former power.

269
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,660
That's as much as I know about them.

270
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,360
In their quest for power, many innocent victims have wound up dead.

271
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,020
Are the secret police the only ones behind these murders?

272
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,760
That's the question I'm faced with.

273
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,480
Is there any way we can really know just how closely the darkness has encroached upon the world we live in?

274
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,580
I don't think I believe in anyone anymore.

275
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,100
Mr. Grimmer even warned me, "Only believe in yourself."

276
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,140
He said, "When you trust other people, it doesn't always work out."

277
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,180
And as he said that, he entrusted me with something very important.

278
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,920
Sorry, I can't stop talking about this.

279
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,380
It's kinda tough on me not even knowing your name.

280
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,640
Oh, hey, listen, it's alright, you don't have to tell me.

281
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,640
I always thought when people spent time getting to know one another,

282
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,820
they told each other their names and about their pasts.

283
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,400
But just talking to you makes me happy.

284
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,500
(soft music)

285
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,180
- Both of my parents are still alive.

286
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,360
They're schoolteachers,

287
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,420
but my father used to participate in democratic activities

288
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,920
and the police always watched him.

289
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,260
So my mom ended up divorcing him

290
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,120
to protect me from any potential trouble.

291
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,180
When I finally told my mom I wanted to be a detective,

292
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
she got angry and told me not to do it.

293
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,880
Why did you want to become a detective?

294
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,140
I believe my friends at the bar told you the reason why, remember?

295
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,660
Wasn't it because you grew up liking cops on TV?

296
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,840
Yeah, I liked playing cops and robbers ever since I was a kid.

297
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,060
Of course, I always got to be the cop.

298
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,440

Oh, come on, Suk.

301
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,480
So, what were you entrusted with?

302
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,040
Huh?

303
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,540
Earlier, you were saying the Grimmer entrusted you with something important?

304
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,620
Oh, it's a key to a safety deposit box.

305
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,380
A safety deposit box?

306
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:18,800
Yeah.

307
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,380
Apparently, whatever's stored in there is super important.

308
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,580
This old German man named Pedrov, who was running an illegal orphanage, was murdered last week.

309
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,020
And?

310
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,580
Inside that deposit box of Pedrov's is the data from some kind of human experiments he supposedly conducted.

311
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,120
According to Grimmer, the material that's in that box is the real cause of all these murders.

312
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,060
Huh?

313
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,900
Don't say that again! Don't tell anyone what you just told me! Not even the police! Nobody!

She's right. She loves you a lot.

316
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,000
When you told her you wanted to be a cop, you know why she got mad?

317
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,680
It's because she was worried that something awful might happen to you.

318
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,400
I got a bad feeling about what you just told me.

319
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
The best thing to do is not to tell anyone.
