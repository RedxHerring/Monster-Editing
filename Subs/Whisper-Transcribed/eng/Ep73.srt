Him? What is it? What are you doing out here?

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,020
Dr. Tenma, a lady who came into the hotel was looking for you.

Who was it?

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,700
She was heading up to the vampire's house.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,080
And she looked just like one of the twins from the drawings I saw up there.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,120
I've always wondered what name she would have.

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:20,660
her Nina. Was that the name they gave to her? Yes, Nina, Nina Fortner.

18
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,880
It is a wonderful name. It's really important to cherish your name. That's

what you always told me, Mr. Pope.

We still have each other.

181
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,760
That's more than enough.

182
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,140
Sorry to interrupt, but I still need some ID.

183
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,400
Just take your time.

184
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,780
I'll come back a little later.

185
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, let's see.

186
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:25,440
here. Ah, there are two right there. Excuse me, folks. I need to see some identification.

187
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,660
Search every building. There might still be survivors inside.

188
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,040
Got a minute?

189
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,480
Yeah, what is it?

190
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,380
I might be wrong, but... I can't believe it.

191
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,300
Johan... He's breathing, but will he live?

192
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,080
Well, it's hard to say. He's got a serious head injury.

193
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,140
Even if we had a really good neurosurgeon on hand.

194
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,780
You do. He's right here in town.

195
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,840
Get him, quickly.

196
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,920
Excuse me, there's something I'd like to ask.

197
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,220
You couldn't be, could you?

198
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,040
You are him! You're that doctor, aren't you?

199
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,740
Dr. Tenma!

200
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,900
You're Dr. Tenma, aren't you?

201
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,940
I need you to come with me right away.

202
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,860
Hey! Wait a minute!

203
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,540
Inspector Lungay of the BKA is asking for you.

204
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:01,360
Look, he sent me to get you because we have a patient in critical condition who needs your help.

205
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,860
"Let him go! My dad isn't a murderer!"

206
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,080
"Now listen, son. We need to take your dad away in order to ask him some questions."

207
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,380
"My dad would never hurt anybody! He was only trying to save me!"

208
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,880
"I'm sorry."

209
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,280
"Dad!"

210
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,860
"I want to forgive him. I really want to do that."

211
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,240
Tenma...

212
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
You weren't wrong, you know.

213
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,080
Not then.

214
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,360
And you won't be now.

215
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,920
Give him back!

216
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,100
My father's not a murderer!
