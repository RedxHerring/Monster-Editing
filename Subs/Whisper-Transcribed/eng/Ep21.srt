00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, honey, can I interest you in this Moscow Mule?

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,820
Oh, thank you, Michael.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,680
My pleasure.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,260
And for you, a big glass of juice on the rocks.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,300
Come on, Fritz, now be polite and thank your father.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,720
Thanks, Mr. Mueller.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,280
Stop it, Fritz.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,780
Leave him be, Barbara.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,620
Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,360
It's the same deal with my new antique business.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,260
Rough start, then smooth sailing.

12
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,680
Well, for me, everything has really happened so quickly.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,280
I suddenly get to live in this gorgeous house,

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,280
and I have a wonderful and caring husband

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,340
who makes me great cocktails.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,880
Hey, honey, did you see something just then?

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,260
There, in the window.

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,780
I get this feeling sometimes, like... like we're being watched.

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,700
What? Honey, that house has been empty for a while.

20
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, I know. It's odd.

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,520
Actually, I talked to Mrs. Daughtry from across the street.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,640
What about?

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,180
She said that 20 years ago, a couple was brutally murdered in that house.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,440
Anyone who moves in never stays for long. They say the place is haunted.

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,560
Michael, dear, what's the matter?

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,500
Wait a minute. Now, don't tell me that you believe in ghosts, too, do you, darling?

27
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,800
Of course not. What do you take me for?

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,100
Are you going out, sir?

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,680
Yeah.

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,080
I'll get the car.

31
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,160
Not this time. I thought it might be a nice change of pace to go out, just the three of us.

32
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,440
Don't worry. No one's going to try anything.

33
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,880
I get it.

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Unless I'm mistaken, you're wanting a little father-son time with the boy.

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,900
You're a smart bodyguard, you know that?

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,620
Best of luck to you, Daddy.

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,960
Have a good time.

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,200
All right, off we go.

39
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:48,420
We'll be right back.

43
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:39,960
So, Detective, what did you dig up?

44
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,760
Regarding Dr. Tenma, everything checked out exactly as you told me.

45
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,760
He's the main suspect in the murder of the Fortner couple,

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,260
but the police have no idea where he is at the moment.

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,500
Here's a transcript of Tenma's statement.

48
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,800
He made it back during that first questioning.

49
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,980
He operated on a boy at Eisler Memorial Hospital 10 years ago.

50
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,000
Saved his life.

51
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,320
Kid went on to kill the hospital director and two other doctors.

52
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,320
The boy's name was Johan.

53
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,940
He was already a young man the next time Tenma encountered him.

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,840
Turns out Johan executed a patient in his care.

55
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,640
Next up, Nina Fortener.

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,720
She was the murdered couple's foster daughter.

57
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,540
No one's seen her since the night they were killed, either.

58
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,000
Messner was a tougher nut to crack,

59
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,360
but I did finally track him down in Frankfurt.

60
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,960
Well, then, what'd you find?

61
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,820
A grave with his name on it.

62
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,180
Turns out he was stabbed to death about two months ago.

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,340
The official police version is that he was on the wrong side

64
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,820
of a drug deal gone bad.

65
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,360
Back when I was a detective on the force,

66
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,200
- Messner was my partner.

67
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
- Sorry for your loss.

68
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,760
They caught Messner with confiscated narcotics

69
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,660
and booted him off the force.

70
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,760
After that, he got some help from a man called The Baby.

71
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,120
Ring any bells?

72
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,080
He's the spokesman for some nationalist group in Frankfurt.

73
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,720
- How is this relevant?

74
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,460
- You remember hearing those news reports

75
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,760
about how its Turkish quarter

76
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,020
almost burned down last winter, right?

77
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,340
Word on the street is the whole thing

78
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,980
was The Baby's brainchild,

79
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,100
and the Turks credit an Asian stranger

80
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,440
with having saved their neighborhood.

81
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,340
Turns out that stranger's name was Tenma.

82
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,880
- What are the odds?

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,860
- I'm thinking it was the doctor.

84
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,080
And what's more, people are saying the baby

85
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,560
had those fires set to commemorate the introduction

86
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,620
of a new leader into their group.

87
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,280
Some wunderkind they were all really excited about.

88
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,780
He was gonna change everything.

89
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,040
- Who is this guy?

90
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,480
- I've already told you.

91
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,480
What was the name of that boy Dr. Tenma saved a decade ago?

92
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,080
Johan.

93
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,200
Well, that young man who was supposed to take the reins

94
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,180
of the babies' organization in Frankfurt,

95
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,300
he was Johan, too.

96
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:51,800
Oh, I should have seen that one coming.

97
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,080
Call me crazy, Roberto, but I feel like one of the pawns on this chessboard, waiting for the axe to fall.

98
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,540
Goodness, what's got you looking so pensive all of a sudden?

99
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,480
Thinking about the past. Everything was going straight to hell for me at the time.

100
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,440
But after that phone call, the change was like night and day.

101
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,540
Back then, my partner Messner and I were selling drugs.

102
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,540
Whatever we confiscated off of the dealers we busted.

103
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,920
The voice on the other end knew everything.

104
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,260
He said it would be our little secret if we did him a favor.

105
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,120
Kill some couple in Heidelberg.

106
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,460
The Fortiners.

107
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,820
I didn't know him from Adam.

108
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,940
But there was another guy there that night.

109
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,160
A newspaper reporter or something.

110
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,440
We killed all three of them. No choice.

111
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,440
After that, somebody wired money to the both of us.

112
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,440
When I left the police force, the syndicate was waiting with a great offer.

113
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,440
They gave me a plum job and the pay was top notch.

114
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,440
I had everything I wanted out of life, or so I thought.

115
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,440
That's when you met your wife and decided to go straight. Or so I would wager.

116
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Yeah, but I still can't figure out why they let me just walk away.

117
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,600
Who was it who called me that day?

118
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,620
I gotta know who transferred all that money over to us who the hell is manipulating my life. Oh damn it

119
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,680
Roberto I want to be sure that you know, I really appreciate your help

120
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,100
Well, if that's how you feel take back that last move

121
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:47,700

father Fritz leave him be honey he's got toys on the brain

124
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:20,320
Roberto, were there any calls from the detective?

125
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,280
He should have come by now.

126
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,420
Roberto?

127
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,660
Roberto, get up here!

128
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,220
It's the detective!

129
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,580
Oh, God, he's...

130
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,320
You... but you're...

131
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,240
Yes, I'm the daughter of the Fortiners,

132
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,400
the couple you murdered.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,780
You shot him in cold blood.

134
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,420
Roberto!

135
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,700
I was watching from next door.

136
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,640
Your bodyguard's the one who killed him.

137
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,480
Roberto?

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,340
That's right. I saw it all through the window.

139
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,840
No, he couldn't have.

140
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,660
I know, Roberto. I trust that man with my life.

141
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,780
You. You murdered him.

142
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,380
You came here for revenge, and he got in the way right damn you

143
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Roberto help me

144
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,220
I'm taking this bag stay here or run for it. I don't give a damn

145
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,960
Just don't be surprised if you're the next person who dies here you bastard

146
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,720
Was that you shouting just now, Mr. Mueller?

147
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,420
Is everything all right?

148
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:13,120
Start this car right now.

149
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,020
Move it!

150
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,560
You've been watching me all this time from the house next door, Will, isn't that right?

151
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,800
So, what happens to me now?

152
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,740
I hate you from the bottom of my heart.

153
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,080
Give me one good reason not to shoot you.

154
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,420
But he knew we had to do whatever he said.

155
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,920
If we didn't kill your folks like he asked,

156
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,060
he was going to tell the cops about the drugs we were selling on the side.

157
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,260
Don't you get it?

158
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,220
We had to do it.

159
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,280
We didn't have any other choice.

160
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,340
Didn't have any other choice

161
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,580
You didn't have any other choice

162
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,680
Stop the car

163
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,420
Stop the car, god damn it

164
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:20,700
My parents were wonderful people

165
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,520
The kindest couple I'll ever know

166
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Mom and Dad loved me.

167
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
They loved me with all their heart and soul.

168
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Wait! Please, don't do this!

169
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,280
It didn't even matter to them that I wasn't their real daughter.

170
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,280
They loved me all the same.

171
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,280
My mom and dad were angels.

172
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
They were angels!

173
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm sorry! Please, don't shoot!

174
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Angels! And they were murdered by a bastard like you!

175
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,520
Barbara.

176
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,360
Oh, God.

177
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,060
Fritz.

178
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,600
Look at me.

179
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,240
Oh, well done, Fritz.

180
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,360
Up we go.

181
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,140
Barbara.

182
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,140
You're crying? For your family?

183
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,140
What about mine?

184
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,140
So this is what it feels like.

185
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,140
Right before somebody kills you.

186
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,140
Fritz, he called me daddy today.

187
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,140
For the first time.

188
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
Don't take that from me.

189
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,140
Please, please let me live.

190
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,380
I finally found someone worth living for.

191
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,760
My Barbara and Fritz.

192
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,240
I met them at half past eight in the morning at a cafe in Dusseldorf.

193
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,120
I'd quit the force and joined the syndicate.

194
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,180
My boss told me to act like a businessman, made for a nice cover.

195
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,260
Every morning, this woman and her little boy would walk by.

196
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,320
They were my daily reminder of the regular, honest life I'd given up.

197
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,420
Hey, so, uh, how you doing?

198
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,340
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

199
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,580
Tell me something. What did you hire that detective for?

200
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,660
I was hoping he could find you and Tenma, and my former partner.

201
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,640
I wanted to know what he was up to.

202
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,340
Messner's dead, for whatever it's worth.

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,900
Stabbed to death.

204
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:56,280
When I heard about that I asked the detective to find out more information last night. I got a phone call from him

205
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,780
I've been digging around. It's strange. What do you mean strange? Think about it Messner was a junkie, right?

206
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,860
Why would the organization go out of its way to help some doped out ex-cop?

207
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,840
Also, the man who killed him wasn't from the Frankfurt group. No as it turns out. He was from Dusseldorf from Dusseldorf. Yeah

208
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,720
I'll give you all the details when I see you in person. Here it is

209
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,900
The draft of the report.

210
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,420
Messner's killer.

211
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,140
It was... it was... Roberto.

212
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,960
Look at this.

213
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,460
Do you know what this means?

214
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,740
Yes, hello?

215
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,100
Hey, boss. I need that bag.

216
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,100
Roberto.

217
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,020
Apropos of nothing, your wife and Fritz are already home.

218
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,520
What?

219
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
What are you saying?

220
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,120
If you hurt them, I'll...

221
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,620
Oh, I'd be hurrying right back about now if I were you.

222
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,980
A lot of accidents happen at home.

223
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,120
Give me your gun.

224
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,260
Look, there's something I gotta do.

225
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,640
Remember, that model's intended for close-range work.

226
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,880
You only got four shots, so make them count.

227
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,220
Don't worry about me. I was an officer once upon a time.

228
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,100
Just be careful.

229
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,840
Can't have me dying before you take me to the police and have me confess to killing your parents.

230
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,820
Is that it?

231
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,600
That's right. So don't even think of dying on me.

232
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,260
I'll cover you from the empty house next door. Good luck.

233
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:58,300
Hi, Daddy!

234
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,860
Oh, Fritz, hey.

235
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,760
Daddy, look! It's a fishing pole!

236
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,680
Fritz just kept on insisting he had to go fishing with his daddy.

237
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,860
Barbara, thank God.

238
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,200
Where's Roberto?

239
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,420
Oh, that reminds me. The gentlemen from his security team are here.

240
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,900
He said something happened while we were out.

241
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,600
His team?

242
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,140
There's no need to worry.

243
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,580
He said everything's fine and no one was hurt.

244
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,380
Oh, Roberto.

245
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,260
Look, Michael's come home.

246
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,940
Everything's all right.

247
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,360
It was nothing important, just a broken window.

248
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,920
Probably just a kid from the neighborhood.

249
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,660
Nothing to worry about.

250
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,660
Nothing at all.

251
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,840
Where's the body?

252
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,360
What have you done with him, damn it?

253
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,640
A body? What are you talking about?

254
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,640
What's going on, Roberto?

255
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,380
Who the hell are you?

256
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,580
Fritz and the little wifey are heading inside.

257
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,940
Don't be stupid.

258
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,500
Hand over the bag.

259
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:06,860
Now.

260
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,040
There you go.

261
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,980
All right, gentlemen, nothing ever happened here.

262
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,620
Understood.

263
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,620
Just another boring day in paradise, right?

264
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,620
Like yesterday.

265
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,620
And tomorrow.

266
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,620
Nina!

267
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,620
Nina!

268
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,620
Nina?

269
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,620
She is such a beautiful girl.

270
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
What?

271
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
What did you do to her?

272
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
Don't look at me like that.

273
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,620
Nina's fine.

274
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,020
My employer considers her a very important guest.

275
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,180
Your employer?

276
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,020
Well, that young man, he was Johan, too.

277
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,280
Johan, Johan, Johan! Everywhere I look, Johan is there!

278
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,860
Who the hell is he? Who the hell are you? Talk!

279
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,640
You want to live happily ever after with Barbara and Fritz, don't you?

280
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,720
Go back to your fairy tale.

281
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,720
Trust me. Leave it alone.

282
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,960
As employers go, you weren't too bad.

283
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,020
But this is where we say goodbye.

284
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,560
What are you going to do with Nina?

285
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,760
Is she going to die?

286
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,060
You take care now.

287
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,380
Hey, Daddy, can you and me go fishing sometime soon?

288
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,020
Oh, yeah.

289
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,080
If it's sunny, how about tomorrow?

290
00:19:40,080 --> 00:20:01,260

I told Fritz that we'd go fishing tomorrow, I promised

Good
