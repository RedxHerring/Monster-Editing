1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, honey, can I interest you in this Moscow mule?

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,840
Oh, thank you, Michael.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,660
My pleasure.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,260
And for you, a big glass of juice on the rocks.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,300
Come on, Fritz, now be polite and thank your father.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,740
Thanks, Mr. Mueller.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,280
Stop it, Fritz.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,620
Leave him be, Barbara. Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,340
Well, it's the same deal with my new antique business.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,280
Rough start, then smooth sailing.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,680
Well, for me, everything has really happened so quickly.

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,280
I suddenly get to live in this gorgeous house,

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,280
and I have a wonderful and caring husband

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,340
who makes me great cocktails.

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,340
[laughing]

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:47,860
Hmm?

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,860
Hey, honey, did you see something just then?

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,360
Hmm?

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,300
There, in the window.

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,780
I have a feeling sometimes like... like we're being watched.

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,700
What? Honey, that house has been empty for a while.

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,020
Yeah, I know. It's odd.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,500
Actually, I talked to Mrs. Daughtry from across the street.

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,680
What about?

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,180
She said that 20 years ago, a couple was brutally murdered in that house.

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,900
Anyone who moves in never stays for long.

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,440
They say the place is haunted.

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,540
Michael, dear, what's the matter?

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,500
Wait a minute. Now, don't tell me that you believe in ghosts, too, do you, darling?

30
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,800
Of course not. What do you take me for?

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,100
Are you going out, sir?

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,060
Yeah. I'll get the car.

33
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,160
Not this time. I thought it might be a nice change of pace to go out, just the three of us.

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,460
Don't worry. No one's gonna try anything.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,680
I get it. Unless I'm mistaken, you're wanting a little father-son time with the boy.

36
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,900
You're a smart bodyguard, you know that?

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:06,140
have a good time all right off we go

38
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,380
(dramatic music)

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,980
- So, Detective, what all did you dig up?

40
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
- Regarding Dr. Tenma,

41
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,760
everything checked out exactly as you told me.

42
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,740
He's the main suspect in the murder

43
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,760
of the Fortner couple,

44
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,240
but the police have no idea where he is at the moment.

45
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,480
Here's a transcript of Tenma's statement.

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,820
during that first questioning.

47
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,100
He operated on a boy at Eisler Memorial Hospital

48
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,000
10 years ago, saved his life.

49
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,180
Kid went on to kill the hospital director

50
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,380
and two other doctors.

51
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,300
The boy's name was Johan.

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,220
He was already a young man

53
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,960
the next time Tenma encountered him.

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,840
Turns out Johan executed a patient in his care.

55
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,620
Next up, Nina Fortner.

56
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,720
She was the murdered couple's foster daughter.

57
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,500
No one's seen her since the night they were killed either.

58
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,020
Messner was a tougher nut to crack,

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,400
but I did finally track him down in Frankfurt.

60
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,960
- Well, then, what'd you find?

61
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,820
- A grave with his name on it.

62
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,180
Turns out he was stabbed to death about two months ago.

63
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,660
The official police version is that he was

64
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,820
on the wrong side of a drug deal gone bad.

65
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,360
- Back when I was a detective on the force,

66
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,820
Messner was my partner.

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,460
- Sorry for your loss.

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,620
They caught Messner with confiscated narcotics

69
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,000
and booted him off the force.

70
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,240
After that, he got some help from a man called the Baby.

71
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,380
Ring any bells?

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,640
He's the spokesman for some nationalist group in Frankfurt.

73
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,020
- How is this relevant?

74
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,360
- You remember hearing those news reports

75
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,660
about how its Turkish quarter

76
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,460
almost burned down last winter, right?

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,300
Word on the street is the whole thing

78
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,640
was the Baby's brainchild,

79
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,980
and the Turks credit an Asian stranger

80
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,360
with having saved their neighborhood.

81
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,920
Turns out that stranger's name was Tenma.

82
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,160
What are the odds?

83
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,720
I'm thinking it was the doctor and what's more people are saying the baby had those fires set to commemorate the introduction of a

84
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,140
new leader into their group

85
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,960
Some wonder can they were all really excited about he was gonna change everything. Who is this guy? I've already told you

86
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,100
What was the name of that boy? Dr. Tenma saved a decade ago

87
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,080
Johan

88
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,180
Well, that young man who was supposed to take the reins of the baby's organization in Frankfurt,

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,320
He was Johan, too.

90
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:51,780
Oh, I should have seen that one coming.

91
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,300
Call me crazy, Roberto, but I feel like one of the pawns

92
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,080
on this chessboard, waiting for the axe to fall.

93
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,760
Goodness.

94
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
What's got you looking so pensive all of a sudden?

95
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,040
Thinking about the past.

96
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,480
Everything was going straight to hell for me at the time.

97
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,440
But after that phone call, the change was like night and day.

98
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,540
Back then, my partner Messner and I were selling drugs,

99
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,540
whatever we confiscated off of the dealers we busted.

100
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,920
The voice on the other end knew everything.

101
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,260
He said it would be our little secret if we did him a favor.

102
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,460
Kill some couple in Heidelberg, the Fortuners.

103
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,860
I didn't know 'em from Adam.

104
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,940
But there was another guy there that night,

105
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,140
a newspaper reporter or something.

106
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,840
We killed all three of 'em, no choice.

107
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,260
After that, somebody wired money to the both of us.

108
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,900
When I left the police force, the syndicate

109
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,340
I was waiting with a great offer.

110
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,400
They gave me a plum job and the pay was top notch.

111
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,880
I had everything I wanted out of life, or so I thought.

112
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,220
- That's when you met your wife and decided to go straight,

113
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,680
or so I would wager.

114
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,900
- Yeah, but I still can't figure out

115
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,420
why they let me just walk away.

116
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,020
Who was it?

117
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,700
Who called me that day?

118
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,920
I gotta know.

119
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,260
Who transferred all that money over to us?

120
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,340
Who the hell is manipulating my life?

121
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,660
Who, damn it?

122
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,840
Roberto, I want to be sure that you know, I really appreciate your help.

123
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,320
Well, if that's how you feel, take back that last move.

124
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Sorry, my friend, no can do.

125
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,900
Ouch, now you're being harsh.

126
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,980
All right, honey, we're leaving.

127
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,560
Okay.

128
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,800
We're gonna buy toys, right? Lots of 'em!

129
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,140
Maybe. But first, say goodbye to your father, Fritz.

130
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,140
Leave him be, honey. He's got toys on the brain.

131
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,560
Bye-bye, Daddy!

132
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,800
Huh?

133
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,220
Bye!

134
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,320
Roberto, were there any calls from the detective?

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,300
He should have come by now.

136
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,420
Roberto?

137
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,460
Roberto!

138
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,200
Get up!

139
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,620
Up here! It's the detective! Oh, God, he's...

140
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,200
You... But you're...

141
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,400
Yes, I'm the daughter of the Fortiners, the couple you murdered.

142
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,420
You shot him in cold blood. Roberto!

143
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,640
I was watching from next door. Your bodyguard's the one who killed him.

144
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,480
Roberto?

145
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,360
That's right. I saw it all through the window.

146
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,660
No, he couldn't have. I know Roberto. I trust that man with my life.

147
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,480
You came here for revenge and he got in the way, right?

148
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,420
Damn you.

149
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,300
Roberto! Help me!

150
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,620
I'm taking this bag.

151
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,340
Stay here or run for it. I don't give a damn.

152
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,860
Just don't be surprised if you're the next person who dies here, you bastard.

153
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,720
Was that you shouting just now, Mr. Mueller?

154
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,420
Is everything all right?

155
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,540
You've been watching me all this time from the house next door, Will, isn't that right?

156
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:41,340
me now I hate you from the bottom of my heart give me one good reason not to shoot you but

157
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:48,400
he knew we had to do whatever he said if we didn't kill your folks like he asked he was

158
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:55,240
gonna tell the cops about the drugs we were selling on the side don't you get it we had to do it

159
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,360
we didn't have any other choice

160
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,340
Didn't have any other choice?

161
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,540
You didn't have any other choice?

162
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,660
Stop the car!

163
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,240
Stop the car, goddammit!

164
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,700
My parents were wonderful people.

165
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,520
The kindest couple I'll ever know.

166
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,600
Mom and Dad loved me. They loved me with all their heart and soul.

167
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,440
Wait! Please don't do this!

168
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,400
It didn't even matter to them that I wasn't their real daughter.

169
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,500
They loved me all the same.

170
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,420
My mom and dad were angels. They were angels!

171
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,500
I'm sorry! Please don't shoot!

172
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,740
Angels! And they were murdered by a bastard like you!

173
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,080
(sobbing)

174
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,560
- Barbara.

175
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,360
Oh God.

176
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,060
Fritz.

177
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,600
- Look at me.

178
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,260
- Oh, well done, Fritz.

179
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,300
- Is that it?

180
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,360
- Up we go.

181
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,200
(sobbing)

182
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,480
- You're crying for your family?

183
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,580
What about mine?

184
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,740
- So this is what it feels like,

185
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,880
right before somebody kills you.

186
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,120
Fritz, he called me daddy today, for the first time.

187
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,100
Don't take that from me.

188
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,020
Please, please let me live.

189
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,400
I finally found someone worth living for.

190
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,740
My Barbara and Fritz.

191
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,220
I met them at half-past eight in the morning at a cafe in Dusseldorf.

192
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,120
I'd quit the force and joined the syndicate.

193
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,180
My boss told me to act like a businessman, made for a nice cover.

194
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,260
Every morning, this woman and her little boy would walk by.

195
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,340
They were my daily reminder of the regular, honest life I'd given up.

196
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,440
Hey, so, uh, how you doing?

197
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,340
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

198
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,580
Tell me something. What did you hire that detective for?

199
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,660
I was hoping he could find you and Tenma and my former partner.

200
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,660
I wanted to know what he was up to.

201
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,340
Messner's dead, for whatever it's worth.

202
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,440
When I heard about that, I asked the detective to find out more information last night. I got a phone call from him

203
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:03,820
I've been digging around. It's strange. What do you mean strange? Think about it Messner was a junkie, right?

204
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,940
Why would the organization go out of its way to help some doped-out ex-cop?

205
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,920
Also, the man who killed him wasn't from the Frankfurt group. No as it turns out he was from Dusseldorf from Dusseldorf. Yeah

206
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,840
I'll give you all the details when I see you in person. Here it is

207
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:29,800
the report. Messner's killer. Who is, who is Roberto? Look at this. Do you know what

208
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:46,520
this means? Yes, hello? Hey boss, I need that bag. Roberto! Apropos of nothing, your wife

209
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:52,400
and Fritz are already home what what are you saying if you hurt them I'll be

210
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,420
hurrying right back about now if I were you a lot of accidents happen at home

211
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,140
Give me your gun.

212
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,280
Look, there's something I gotta do.

213
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,640
Remember, that model's intended for close-range work.

214
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,860
You only got four shots, so make 'em count.

215
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,200
Don't worry about me. I was an officer once upon a time.

216
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,140
Just be careful.

217
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,840
You can't have me dying before you take me to the police and have me confess to killing your parents.

218
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,840
Is that it?

219
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,640
That's right.

220
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,600
So don't even think of dying on me.

221
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,560
I'll cover you from the empty house next door.

222
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,260

- Hi, Daddy! - Oh, Fritz, hey.

224
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,760
- Daddy, look! It's a fishing pole!

225
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,680
- Fritz just kept on insisting he had to go fishing with his daddy.

226
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,840
- Barbara, thank God.

227
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,200
Well, where's Roberto?

228
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,840
- Oh, that reminds me.

229
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,420
The gentlemen from his security team are here.

230
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,880
He said something happened while we were out.

231
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,580
- His team?

232
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,140
- There's no need to worry.

233
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,000
He said everything's fine and no one was hurt. Oh

234
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,300
Roberto look Michael's come home

235
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,420
Everything's alright. It was nothing important. Just a broken window

236
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,710
Probably just a kid from the neighborhood. Nothing to worry about nothing at all

237
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,880
Where's the body

238

What did you do to her?

252
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,500
Don't look at me like that. Nina's fine.

253
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,020
My employer considers her a very important guest.

Hey, Daddy, can you and me go fishing sometime soon?
