36
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,180
telling you what my occupation was but that was a long time ago my days in

37
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,300
medicine are over but I suppose you're no longer a detective detective

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,020
suspended on narcotics charges this article really came as a shock when I

39
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:55,920
read it six months ago don't even think about running away I have a gun trained

40
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,740
on you under my jacket

41
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,500
All right, what do you want with me?

42
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,720
I need answers. What happened in Heidelberg almost a year ago?

43
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,780
And who was behind it all? Who ordered you to do such a terrible thing?

44
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,920
I don't know anything.

45
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,860
You killed the Fortners and Mr. Maurer from the post.

46
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,200
It wasn't me that did it. I was hired as the lookout, that's all.

47
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,060
And my partner Mueller, he did it. He killed all of them.

48
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,580
Detective Mueller also left the force soon after the murders.

49
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,160
Yeah, he did.

50
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,240
I hear that he's very well off.

51
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,440
Turns out he's doing good with his money.

52
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,720
You, on the other hand, ended up wasting all of your money on your drug habit.

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,120
That sound about right?

54
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880
He was the one who took on the job, and he was the one who committed the murders.

55
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,560
He ended up getting the largest portion of the reward.

56
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,300
They even tried to get rid of me.

57
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,100
They tried to kill me to make sure I didn't go to the cops.

58
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,140
I'm surprised you're still breathing

59
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,880
It was the organization that helped me

60
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,300
Organization?

61
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,500
Enough! I already told her too much as it is

62
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,800
Told her? Her who?

63
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,660
Leave me alone already! I can't deal with you right now!

64
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,540
Looks like you're going through withdrawal

65
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,660
And with me sitting here, no dealer would come within 20 feet of you

66
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,400
So I suggest you start talking

67
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,100
I... I was... I was saved by the baby

68
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,100
The baby?

69
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,700
Go to a pub called Candy, you can find him there

70
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,180
Wait, who's this baby you're talking about?

71
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,600
He's a right-wing extremist

72
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,640
He's also a high official in two of their major political parties

73
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,740
After the wall fell, the baby tried to create a town of only pure-blooded Germans

74
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,500
But his plan failed, and now he's come back.

75
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,160
But why'd he do it? Why'd he bother saving you?

76
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,900
The darkness.

77
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,740
After the Berlin Wall fell, a great darkness was created.

78
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,180
A monster. A monster was born.

79
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,340
A monster?

80
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,420
Now leave me alone! I've already said everything to that girl, you understand?

81
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,100
What girl, Messner?

82
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,040
She came for revenge and pointed a gun at me.

83
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,020
She's the daughter of that older couple we murdered.

84
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,320
You're saying Anna...

85
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,560
I mean Nina. Nina Fortner came to see you then?

86
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,080
The baby said to me that I was to send that girl to him if I ever saw her

87
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,320
or if she ever showed up around these parts.

88
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,320
He said that she's important to use as bait.

89
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,680
he's using her as bait

90
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:57,080
you don't give up do you you're getting to be a regular coming back all the time

91
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,380
how about i rent you for an hour or two so the night ain't a total waste

92
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,460
you're the one who said i'd get in trouble if i did business without the baby's permission

93
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,440
well we got ourselves a mouthy one yeah not so clever now are you

94
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:19,260
Is this the girl who keeps asking to see the baby?

95
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,960
Uh, yes, sir.

96
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,300
It seems you're getting your wish.

97
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,420
Don't keep him waiting.

98
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:53,400
Please wait right here, miss.

99
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,560
Stand on that eye motif, if you'd be so kind.

100
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,340
Directly over the iris, please.

101
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,980
Yes, much better.

102
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:40,920
Now tell me, Nina Fortner,

103
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,540
Doesn't this song resonate with you right down to the soles of your feet?

104
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,240
I have to dance.

105
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,900
The baby told me.

106
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,860
The day another Hitler is born to us, our country will be saved.

107
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,400
The girl will be the perfect bait for him.

108
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,420
Nina!

109
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
How is it that you know my name?

110
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
That's the least of what I know.

111
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,920
You've also entered to the name of Anna Liebert,

112
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,920
but the former is just as false as the latter.

113
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,920
A rose by any other name does smell as sweet,

114
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,920
but they call me the baby, so I'm biased.

115
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Come on, let's cut the rug a bit.

116
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Is it true that you know where my brother is right now?

117
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Ah, Johann, right? Good name, yes.

118
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
You know, don't you?

119
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,300
What are you going to do when you finally have your little family reunion?

120
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,820
I'm going to take him down.

121
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,100
You shouldn't rip that out willy-nilly, miss.

122
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,740
Someone's liable to get hurt.

123
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,260
Patience, dear.

124
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,260
Why, I'm sure Johan is searching for you even as we speak.

125
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,640
I lived around here when I was your age.

126
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,120
Know this place like the back of my hand.

127
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,440
There's a fella who buys antiques.

128
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,720
Gonna sell him this rug I stumbled across.

129
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,680
What do you mean?

130
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,880
Don't you have any money left, Mr. Heckle?

131
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,600
Shut your yap already.

132
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,540
I'm hocking this rug so I can get the two of us something to eat.

133
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,320
I don't hear you coming up with...

134
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,960
Huh?

135
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,280
Son of a...

136
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
There goes the neighborhood

137
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,240
Mr. Heckle, what's wrong Turks? This whole area is full of Turks now

138
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,960
Your so-called heirloom is a fake, huh? What are you talking about? Feel it hand-woven silk

139
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:03,040
You can't pick this kind of quality. It's synthetic. Tell you what, I'll give you a hundred marks for it out of sheer sympathy

140
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,360
Ha more like sheer chicanery the German guy who had this place would have given me ten grand

141
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Well, you can take it or leave it

142
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,900
Don't you come crying to me when you realize my rug is the real deal that one hanging on the wall is the real deal

143
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:27,380
Yeah, it's a genuine headache a rug. There's your hand woven silk. Look at the detail there in the patterns. It's perfect

144
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,160
150,000 marks

145
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,980
You sure got took for a ride

146
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,780
If you really can't tell the good stuff from that crap

147
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,080
I feel sorry for you

148
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,740
We're out of here, Dieter

149
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:47,900
Hey, I'm getting kind of hungry

150
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,920
That rug's real

151
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,640
Huh?

152
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,040
It's a haneke, just like he said

153
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,180
Only 150 grand?

154
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,300
I could get $800,000 for a rug as fancy as that.

155
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
Come on, let's get something to eat already.

156
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,560
Shut up.

157
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,860
If I can get my hands on that rug, we'll be able to eat anything we want.

158
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,880
How you gonna do that?

159
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,320
What are you talking about?

160
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,640
I'm sure I'll think of something.

161
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,320
Huh?

162
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,040
Don't give me that look.

163
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,520
You're hungry, ain't ya?

164
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,740
Whatever, thief.

165
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,140
What?

166
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,300
Put a sock in it, you little brat.

167
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:22,820
Jeez.

168
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:33,040
Hold on a second. Where do you think you're going?

169
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,940
Sorry, but I'm not looking to buy.

170
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,460
That's not what I meant. Are you crazy?

171
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,880
An Asian like you is going to get killed if you walk into a place like that.

172
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,140
They don't take kindly to foreigners in there.

173
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,140
But you're Turkish, aren't you?

174
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,040
Is it alright for you to be doing business around here?

175
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,900
What are you, stupid? I wouldn't do business in a dump like this.

176
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,400
A friend of mine was just abducted by a bunch of guys who were regulars there.

177
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:57,920
What?

178
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,760
It seems like she found out a secret of theirs.

179
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,940
A secret?

180
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,140
I don't know what it's all about, but I have to find her before something bad happens.

181
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,860
Who knows what they're going to do to her?

182
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,940
A woman I know is in there, too. I have to get her out.

183
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,280
Who is she? What does this woman look like? Does she have long blonde hair?

184
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,960
Don't know. I couldn't tell you what she looks like now.

185
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,120
Because they just took a young blonde girl away in a car.

186
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,860
Where'd they take her?

187
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,300
Hey, how should I know?

188
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,240
But the baby was with them, so they probably went to his mansion.

189
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,500
The baby? What kind of car? What color was it?

190
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,040
It was big and red. I don't know.

191
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,000
All right, then. I've got to track down that red car before it's too late.

192
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,320
Wait. You have to do something to help my friend, too.

193
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,640
Please help her. She has a small baby.

194
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,380
If something happens to her, please!

195
00:14:49,960 --> 00:15:07,940
You're still alive.

196
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,700
This is my lucky day.

197
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,900
This way, please.

198
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Without your gun.

199
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,640
On this point, I'm afraid I must insist.

200
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,420
Thank you for your cooperation.

201
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,600
Go ahead and sit wherever you like.

202
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,160
Hmm.

203
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,300
So the baby brought you in, eh?

204
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,100
Eyes forward, let me see your face.

205
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Goodness! But I should have known you'd be quite a beauty. After all, you are Johann's twin sister.

206
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:14,960
My name is Professor Giedlitz, and the man standing next to Johann in the picture is General Wulf.

207
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,420
We created this organization along with a pair of other like-minded individuals.

208
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,180
Where are my manners? Would you care for some fruit?

209
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,080
No, thank you. I want to see Johan.

210
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,980
And see him you will.

211
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,420
Once he knows that you're here, no force on Earth could keep him away.

212
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,180
The boy suffers mightily in your absence.

213
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,440
You people don't know where Johan is either, do you?

214
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,500
We need him. His country needs him.

215
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,280
We four shall help him fulfill his destiny.

216
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,420
Do you have any idea how Hitler became possessed of such power?

217
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,080
It's because he saw the three things a person would have to do to gain control of a country.

218
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,920
Manipulate the banks, feed the war machine, and take command of the military.

219
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,100
I'm sure Johan's working on one of those things right now.

220
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,880
Or two. Really, it's a question of if, not when.

221
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,300
What exactly do you plan to do with Johan?

222
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,600
Think of it. Hitler bent a weakened nation to his will using nothing but raw charisma.

223
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,180
All that from a man who only made corporal.

224
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,620
A man whom art school wouldn't deign to let in.

225
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,600
His charisma appeared after he hit his thirties.

226
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,180
Not so with your brother, Johan.

227
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,540
He was a leader of men even as a mere boy.

228
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,840
Charisma of messianic proportions.

229
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,760
But even Jesus Christ had help.

230
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,280
Consider the three magi and John the Baptist

231
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,260
who heralded the Savior's arrival into the world,

232
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,580
how they readied the way for His glory.

233
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,920
Likewise, the four of us have been keeping track of Johan's talents

234
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,420
ever since he was a little boy.

235
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,620
Exciting, wouldn't you say?

236
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,060
What is it that you want with me?

237
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,920
Please accept our hospitality.

238
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,700
Until Johan comes looking for you at the very least.

239
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,100
Actually, I'm afraid I must insist.

240
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,380
You know too much for us to let you walk away now.

241
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,600
Don't worry about that.

242
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,480
I came here of my own volition.

243
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,940
I will wait here for Johan.

244
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,580
Then we agree.

245
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,820
Now then, you should at least try the fruit.

246
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:54,120
good you're finally awake don't look so worried we're not going to hurt you

247
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,040
not right away at least so what brings you to my little slice of the world

248
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,560
dr tenma wait how do you already know what my name is

249
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:12,620
why don't you leave the questions to me now all you have to do is answer why exactly were you

250
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,260
snooping around i know you're looking for johan but i can't figure out why where are you keeping

251
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:25,580
nina i told you to leave the questions to me did i not what are you gonna do with her why do you

252
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:33,760
insist on fixing me nina is our guest whereas you are just a meddlesome piece of trash to be

253
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:42,220
disposed of so is she okay at the moment but that'll change soon enough she's determined to

254
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:48,560
kill johan and we simply can't have that always a shame when a pretty girl dies before her time

255
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:55,260
you're just using nina as bait to draw out johan what are you planning on doing who the hell are

256
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,840
you that is enough a person of impure race has no right to ask those questions

257
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,840
The Saracens never know their place, which is why we're putting the Turkish quarter to the torch!

258
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
The whole quarter?

259
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:21,840
Indeed. The night sky tomorrow will be a thing of beauty, of fiery cleansing.

260
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,840
If I stay here, then I'll find Johan.

Okay, where are you right now?

271
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,780
The third floor

272
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:28,320
It sounds like you're speaking with an accent

273
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,660
Where are you from?

274
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,080
I'm Turkish

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,380

282
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,360

or my baby will die too

285
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:58,780
Tomorrow night we celebrate in honor of Johan's homecoming.

286
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,040
Only the members of the pure master race like us deserve to survive.

287
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,340
Everything else should just burn away.

288
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,660
I overheard them talking.

289
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,240
They're going to burn it all down tomorrow night.

290
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,500
They're going to destroy the Turkish part of town.

291
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,000
Help me! Please help me!
