My partner Mueller, he did it. He killed all of them.

Detective Mueller also left the force soon after the murders.

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,240
Yeah, he did. I hear that he's very well off.

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,540
He ended up getting the largest portion of the reward!

172
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,400
Yes. A friend of mine was just abducted by a bunch of guys who are regulars there.

173
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:57,920
What?

174
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,700
It seems like she found out a secret of theirs.

175
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,960
A secret?

176
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,140
I don't know what it's all about, but I have to find her before something bad happens.

177
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,860
Who knows what they're going to do to her.

178
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,940
A woman I know is in there too. I have to get her out.

179
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,280
Who is she? What does this woman look like? Does she have long blonde hair?

180
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,940
Don't know. I couldn't tell you what she looks like now.

181
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,120
Because they just took a young blonde girl away in a car.

182
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,840
Where'd they take her?

183
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,300
Hey, how should I know?

184
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,240
But the baby was with them, so they probably went to his mansion.

185
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,500
The baby? What kind of car? What color was it?

186
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,040
It was big and red. I don't know.

187
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,980
All right, then. I've got to track down that red car before it's too late.

188
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,320
Wait. You have to do something to help my friend, too.

189
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,640
Please help her. She has a small baby.

Let me see your face.

209
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,000
Goodness, but I should have known you'd be quite a beauty.

210
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,400
After all, you are Johan's twin sister.

211
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,460
My name is Professor Giedlitz,

212
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,780
and the man standing next to Johan

213
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,620
in the picture is General Wulf.

214
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,300
We created this organization along with a pair of other like-minded individuals.

215
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,180
Where are my manners? Would you care for some fruit?

216
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,100
No, thank you. I want to see Johan.

217
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,000
And see him you will.

218
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,420
Once he knows that you're here, no force on Earth could keep him away.

219
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,280
The boy suffers mightily in your absence.

220
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,440
You people don't know where Johan is either, do you?

221
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,500
We need him. His country needs him.

222
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,280
The four shall help him fulfill his destiny.

223
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,540
Do you have any idea how Hitler became possessed

224
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,420
of such power?

225
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,740
It's because he saw the three things a person

226
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,100
would have to do to gain control of a country.

227
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,060
Manipulate the banks, feed the war machine,

228
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,920
and take command of the military.

229
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,440
I'm sure Johann's working on one of those things

230
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,880
Or two. Really, it's a question of if, not when.

231
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,280
What exactly do you plan to do with Johan?

232
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,600
Think of it. Hitler bent a weakened nation to his will using nothing but raw charisma.

233
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,840
All that from a man who only made corporal.

234
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,620
A man whom art school wouldn't deign to let in.

235
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,600
His charisma appeared after he hit his thirties.

236
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,180
Not so with your brother, Johan.

237
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,520
He was a leader of men even as a mere boy.

238
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,800
Charisma of messianic proportions.

239
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,760
But even Jesus Christ had help.

240
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,280
Consider the three magi and John the Baptist

241
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,240
who heralded the Savior's arrival into the world,

242
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,580
how they readied the way for His glory.

243
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,880
Likewise, the four of us have been keeping track

244
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,420
of Johan's talents ever since he was a little boy.

245
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,620
Exciting, wouldn't you say?

246
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,060
What is it that you want with me?

247
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,940
Please, accept our hospitality.

248
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,700
Until Johan comes looking for you, at the very least.

249
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,100
Actually, I'm afraid I must insist.

250
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,380
You know too much for us to let you walk away now.

251
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,600
Don't worry about that.

252
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
I came here of my own volition.

253
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,940
I will wait here for Johan.

254
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,580
Then we agree.

255
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,820
Now then, you should at least try the fruit.

256
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,020
Good, you're finally awake.

257
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,640
Don't look so worried.

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,100
We're not going to hurt you.

259
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,420
Not right away, at least.

260
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,680
So what brings you to my little slice of the world, Dr. Tenma?

261
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,480
Wait, how do you already know what my name is?

262
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,460
Why don't you leave the questions to me?

263
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,800
Now all you have to do is answer.

264
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,740
were you snooping around I know you're looking for Johan but I can't figure out

265
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,760
why where are you keeping Nina I told you to leave the questions to me did I

266
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:30,620
not what are you gonna do with her why do you insist on me Nina is our guest

267
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,060
whereas you are just a meddlesome piece of trash to be disposed of so is she

268
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,420
- At the moment, but that'll change soon enough.

269
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,960
She's determined to kill Johan,

270
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,720
and we simply can't have that.

271
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,500
Always a shame when a pretty girl dies before her time.

272
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,000
- You're just using Nina as bait to draw out Johan?

273
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,060
What are you planning on doing?
