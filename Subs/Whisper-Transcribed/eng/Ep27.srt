00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
only interested in getting hold of his fortune.

179
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,020
He'll despise me forever!

180
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,720
How my mother lived her life until her death,

181
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,420
and with everything I've gone through up till now,

182
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,740
he knows nothing about me,

183
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,300
and I won't stand for him thinking I'm after his fortune

184
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,480
when he doesn't know a thing!

185
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,900
That's exactly why you should go talk to him.

186
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,340
You have to gain his trust,

187
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,820
make him understand the truth about his son.

188
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,940
I never believed that I'm his son.

189
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,320
Well, don't you have something from your past that would prove it to him?

190
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,740
What?

191
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,700
Anything he might recognize or remember. You know, something you both could recall.

192
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,840
No. There's nothing, far as I know.

193
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,060
Think back. There must be something.

194
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,940
I'm drawing a big blank. It doesn't matter. I don't want to tell him, okay?

195
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,420
If that's the case, can you explain why you spent all that time having me tutor you in Latin?

196
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,340
Wasn't it because you wanted to please him?

197
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,480
Because you wanted to make him proud of you?

198
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,020
I'm thinking that maybe...

199
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,260
I should quit my job being his reader.

200
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,520
Yeah, it's for the best.

201
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,960
Thanks for all your concern. I appreciate it, but I guess I'm done.

202
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,640
Yohan, wait. I feel you're entitled to know the truth.

203
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,520
I do have something that can prove who I am.

204
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,260
Well, what is it?

205
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,500
It's dumb. I don't know why I'm still holding on to it.

206
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm not going to convince him, and I don't need to.

207
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,540
My foster parents are coming to visit me next week.

208
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,480
I've been fooling myself.

209
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm not the son he'd want to have.

210
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,460
So I see.

211
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,520
When your mind's made up, it's important not to waver.

212
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,600
So for the time being, Carl,

213
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,000
I think it would be a good idea to let me keep an eye on your proof.

214
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,740
We're so happy to hear your studies are going well.

215
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,160
Isn't that right, Mother?

216
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,180
Uh-huh.

217
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,100
But I've been worried about you, Carl.

218
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,280
Well, uh, I'm always eating out so I know I have to be careful not to gain any weight.

219
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,500
Better stay away from your mother's cooking, too.

220
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,100
But it's so delicious.

221
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,700
How's your social life, son? Are you making a lot of new friends here?

222
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,680
Yeah. I've got some people I hang out with and can talk to about anything.

223
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,380
Terrific. It's always good to have friends.

224
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,220
Yes, that's very true. And it looks to us like you're doing quite well.

225
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,060
I'm extremely grateful to both of you that I can even be here.

226
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,700
sudden there's no need for thanks. For years I was shuttled from one foster

227
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,460
home to another where no one cared about me, but you two have treated me with such

228
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,240
kindness. That's because you're a wonderful young man. We both think so.

229
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,580
That's right, girl. Thank you for everything you've given me, Mr. and

230
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:33,300
Mrs. Lindner. Isn't it about time you stopped calling us Mr. and Mrs.? We came

231
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,120
here hoping that you would finally accept our offer. We know this has been

232
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:37,800
for you.

233
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,740
But now, with college treating you so well,

234
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,900
Mother and I were wondering if you'd made up your mind.

235
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,640
Have you decided to become our adopted son, Carl?

236
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,960
We believe in you, and we want you to succeed.

237
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,400
We trust you.

238
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,440
You trust us, don't you?

239
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,520
Oh, absolutely.

240
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,580
We understand why you might still be a little hesitant.

241
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,520
There's a chance your real parents are still alive.

242
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,300
No matter how much effort we make,

243
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,240
we can never be your birth parents, but maybe--

244
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,720
There's no "maybe" about it.

245
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,740
Because the both of you are as real to me as my birth parents could ever be.

246
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,100
Let's have a toast.

247
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,760
Feel like some expensive champagne, son?

248
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,380
Yeah!

249
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,620
Waiter! Bring us the champagne list!

250
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,140
We're celebrating! Today's a special day!

251
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,800
Hello, Carl speaking.

252
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,200
Hello, Carl.

253
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,920
It's me.

254
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,920
Do you know who this is?

255
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,300
Mr. Shoevault?

256
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,420
That's correct.

257
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,020
Now, what's this I hear about you quitting your job?

258
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,060
Uh, right, sir.

259
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,000
That's very disappointing.

260
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,160
for any inconvenience this might cause.

261
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,340
- I just hate to see you abandon your Latin.

262
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,000
You put so much hard work into it.

263
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,140
- Thank you for your concern, sir.

264
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,660
- It really is a shame.

265
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,540
I'm going to miss you, you know.

266
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,540
As a favor to me, if you don't mind,

267
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,440
would you read to me one last time?

268
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,420
- Sure, it'd be my pleasure.

269
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:37,520
How about the third chapter of "From Aeolus to Lemnos"?

270
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,760
Ah, a splendid choice.

271
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,700
That mysterious sea beckons for the death of even the god Phoebus.

272
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,540
What other pleasure could there be

273
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,200
than to wish death upon the sons and daughters of Cerberus?

274
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,200
Now, move forward, softly whispers Zeus.

275
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,120
Move forward, move on.

276
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,100
and dance in the temple that belongs to the dark gods,

277
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,440
the gods of Juno, who dwell in the sea,

278
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,100
the earth, and the heavens.

279
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,100
From the summit of the Parthenon,

280
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,440
steal the forbidden apple of Campania,

281
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,760
and bring forth the apple and everything,

282
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,420
everything to save my soul.

283
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, bring forth everything to save my soul.

284
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,300
(dramatic music)

285
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,240
- Mr. Shoevault, but your phone call.

286
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,200
- Magnificent.

287
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,800
So heartfelt and meaningful.

288
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,240
The best I've heard in my whole life.

289
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Why did you keep this from me?

290
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,420
- Is that mine?

291
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:32,080
so many memories I gave it to Margo a long time ago a good luck charm I wanted

292
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,440
to pass that luck to you this is yours car my son

293
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,260
I've put you through so much.

294
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,700
Oh, Father!

295
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,120
I've found my son.

296
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,140
This is all thanks to one person.

297
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,420
He told me about you.

298
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,900
about everything. His help was invaluable, so from now on, he'll be working for me as

299
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,540
my secretary. He is a young man who can be trusted.
