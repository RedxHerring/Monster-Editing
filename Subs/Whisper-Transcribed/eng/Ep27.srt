whether she wants to see you or not yeah I'm really hoping she will Richard I

We'll be right back.

♪♪♪

16
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:04,260
♪♪♪

17
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:34,240
We'll see you next time.

18
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:43,060
Dr. Reifwein, what's your impression of this man?

19
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,620
Tell me something, Richard.

20
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,660
Huh?

21
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,900
Precisely, why do you think you're here?

22
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,980
Well, you're here for counseling.

23
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,640
I asked the questions, remember?

24
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,560
And as I've told you before, I'm a doctor, not a fortune teller.

25
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,360
Right. Your insight comes from your years of experience with patients.

26
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,820
Hmm. So, who's the boy in the photo this time?

27
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,900
A person of interest in my case.

28
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,660
He made the initial discovery of Edmund Farn's body at the alleged suicide scene.

29
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,820
Supposedly, he's a friend of the deceased. That's all I know.

30
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,380
Well, here's what I know, Richard.

31
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,020
Yeah?

32
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,940
You're a dedicated workaholic, but you've got to learn to take time for yourself to relax.

33
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,880
I'm beginning to do just that.

34
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,640
Will wonders never cease?

35
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,000
And, Doctor, I have news.

36
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,320
About what?

37
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,840
Rosemary. I might be able to see her very soon.

38
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,940
Oh. Well, you must be looking forward to that.

39
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Yeah.

40
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,380
But just remember, if you do get to see her, you can't get back the time you've lost.

41
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,440
You need to be emotionally prepared for changes in her.

42
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,160
No matter what.

43
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,100
And listen, you must not touch a drop of alcohol. Am I clear?

44
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,880
Don't worry. I won't.

45
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,360
I suppose you're off to work on your case again.

46
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,100
Yep.

47
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,760
Don't leave yet.

48
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,620
I think it's time to talk about the event that got you kicked off the police force.

49
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,120
Tell me, Richard, what do you remember from that day?

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,620
Well, I remember all of it.

51
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,240
He was 16 years old and a suspected murderer.

52
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,920
I'd been drinking on the job when I spotted him.

53
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,480
I shot him dead.

54
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,680
He died because I was drunk.

55
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,320
You've faced up to it.

56
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,340
But that doesn't erase it. It will always be there.

57
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,920
And nothing can remove that memory from your head.

58
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,260
So do you know what's important now?

59
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,520
Giving myself permission to move on, right?

60
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,940
That's correct. You may step to the head of the class.

61
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,720
Do I get an A+, Professor?

62
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,020
Not so fast. I don't give out perfect scores easily. I demand results.

63
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,080
And besides, I'm not all that crazy about perfect patients.

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,440
They're boring, frankly.

65
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,080

Carl Neumann, a business admin student

73
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,780
in the economics department at Munich University.

74
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,060
Apparently, he told that prostitute

75
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,220
posing as margot langer that he too is shoe vault's real son at this point i don't know whether he was

76
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,100
telling the truth or not however i need to investigate that possibility

77
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:48,660
yes excuse me i finished all the cleaning so i'll be going now yeah thanks for all your hard work

78
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,260
cleaning for you is never hard work it's pretty rare for a man living by himself to be so neat

79
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,420
It makes my job here extremely pleasant.

80
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,540
Well, lately I've been trying to clean up my act on all fronts.

81
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,860
I couldn't help but notice.

82
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,000
You've got a new picture of your daughter.

83
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,300
Yes. I may be able to see her soon.

84
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,820
Really? That's just wonderful.

85
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,860
Your daughter will be so delighted.

86
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,200
Do you really think so?

87
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,500
Of course. What young girl wouldn't be happy to see her father?

88
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:31,020
Yeah, it was a tough one. So, were you able to turn your paper in on time?

89
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:40,480
Carl Neumann, I can't figure you out. If you know for sure, then why haven't you told Shuval that you're his son?

90
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:48,980
Are you just another con man, or are you the real deal? If you're legit, then what is stopping you?

91
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:55,860
Don't you realize that any parent would be overjoyed just to see their own child?

92
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:40,760
I'm so sorry she said she doesn't want to see you oh well that's fine she's made

93
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,940
up her mind I didn't want to force her it's her decision hey that's okay don't

94
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,140
- Don't worry about it, it's fine.

95
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,680
- I've gotta go.

96
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,480
- Yeah, fine.

97
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:25,900
Yes?

98
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,640
What can I get for you, sir?

99
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,720
A whiskey will do.

100
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,400
Sure.

101
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Here you go.

102
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Uh, sir?

103
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:38,260
Then I'll just go where he is and you can find us there

104
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,840
No, you can't

105
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,500
Oh, Carl, when you're all grown up, you can meet your father if you want

106
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,980
Don't hate him if he turns you away

107
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,780
Promise me that, no matter what.

108
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,540
Because Mommy doesn't hate him.

109
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,940
Keep this with you always.

110
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,180
It was a gift from your father on the day you were born.

111
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,560
With none to admire them, the daffodils of Laris proudly bloom.

112
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,820
With none to mind them, the trees of Pieria rustle.

113
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,760
Oh, the bloody tracks of the nameless man.

114
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,100
That was wonderful.

115
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,340
I must say, Norman, you've come a long way and become an excellent reader.

116
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,060
Thanks very much, sir.

117
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm impressed by how much your Latin has improved in the short time you've been reading for me.

118
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,380
To be perfectly honest, I'm being tutored by someone.

119
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,720
Oh. Well, he certainly is an excellent teacher.

120
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,500
Would he be anybody I know?

121
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,700
Johan. Johan Liebert is my tutor.

122
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,380
Johan. A proficient young man.

123
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,160
Yes.

124
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,140
And not only in Latin.

125
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,080
Huh?

126
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,620
He has an extensive knowledge of law and economics.

127
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,100
An amazing aptitude, in fact, for whatever he studies.

128
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,440
He's a boy who's beautifully gifted at everything.

129
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,880
He's true perfection.

130
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:22,220
Uh, um, Mr. Schuwalt, what would you think if a boy like him...

131
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,980
What if Johann Liebert was actually your real son?

132
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,720
Then he smiled.

133
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,040
It was the first time I'd ever seen him smile.

134
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,680
He made it clear that you're worthy enough to be his son, Johan.

135
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,200
To be honest, I was jealous.

136
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,040
No matter which way I looked at it, you came off better than me.

137
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,380
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I do envy you.

138
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,840
Why don't you just tell him?

139
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,700
Come on, Karl, what have you got to lose?

140
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,220
Go ahead and tell Schuwald you're his real son.

141
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,360
Will you stop it?

142
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,840
How many times must I tell you I have no intention of doing that?

143
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,040
What would be the point if I did?

144
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,520
He would never believe me.

145
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,940
And worse than that,

146
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,460
then he'll think of me as just another greedy predator

147
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
only interested in getting hold of his fortune.

148
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,020
He'll despise me forever.

149
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,740
How my mother lived her life until her death,

150
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,440
and with everything I've gone through up till now,

151
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,780
he knows nothing about me,

152
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,280
and I won't stand for him thinking I'm after his fortune

153
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,480
when he doesn't know a thing.

154
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,920
That's exactly why you should go talk to him.

155
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,340
You have to gain his trust.

156
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,820
Make him understand the truth about his son.

157
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,940
He'll never believe that I'm his son.

158
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,320
Well, don't you have something from your past that would prove it to him?

159
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,780
What?

160
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,360
Anything he might recognize or remember.

161
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,700
You know, something you both could recall.

162
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,820
No, there's nothing, far as I know.

163
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,060
Think back. There must be something.

164
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,960
I'm drawing a big blank. It doesn't matter. I don't want to tell him, okay?

165
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,400
If that's the case, can you explain why you spent all that time having me tutor you in Latin?

166
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,440
Wasn't it because you wanted to please him? Because you wanted to make him proud of you?

167
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:37,440
I'm thinking that maybe I should quit my job being his reader. Yeah, it's for the best.

168
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,980
Thanks for all your concern. I appreciate it.

169
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,940
But I guess I'm done.

170
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,100
Johan, wait.

171
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,640
I feel you're entitled to know the truth.

172
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,500
I do have something that can prove who I am.

173
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,280
Well, what is it?

174
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,480
It's dumb. I don't know why I'm still holding on to it.

175
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm not going to convince him, and I don't need to.

176
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,540
My foster parents are coming to visit me next week.

177
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,480
I've been fooling myself.

178
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,100
I'm not the son he'd want to have.

179
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,460
So I see.

180
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,520
When your mind's made up, it's important not to waver.

181
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,620
So for the time being, Carl,

182
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,000
I think it would be a good idea to let me keep an eye on your proof.

183
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,720
We're so happy to hear your studies are going well.

184
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Isn't that right, Mother?

185
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,180
Uh-huh.

186
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,080
But I've been worried about you, Carl.

187
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,880
I want to make sure you're eating right.

188
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,280
Well, I'm always eating out, so I know I have to be careful not to gain any weight.

189
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,500
Better stay away from your mother's cooking, too.

190
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,080
But it's so delicious.

191
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,700
How's your social life, son? Are you making a lot of new friends here?

192
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,680
Yeah. I've got some people I hang out with and can talk to about anything.

193
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,420
Terrific. It's always good to have friends.

194
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,220
Yes, that's very true. And it looks to us like you're doing quite well.

195
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,060
I'm extremely grateful to both of you that I can even be here.

196
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,180
Whoa, what's this all of a sudden? There's no need for thanks.

197
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,800
For years I was shuttled from one foster home to another where no one cared about me.

198
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,940
But you two have treated me with such kindness.

199
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,220
That's because you're a wonderful young man. We both think so.

200
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,520
That's right, Carl.

201
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,220
Thank you for everything you've given me, Mr. and Mrs. Lindner.

202
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,820
Isn't it about time you stopped calling us Mr. and Mrs.?

203
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,620
We came here hoping that you would finally accept our offer.

204
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,840
We know this has been hard for you.

205
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,740
But now, with college treating you so well,

206
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,900
Mother and I were wondering if you'd made up your mind.

207
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,640
Have you decided to become our adopted son, Carl?

208
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,960
We believe in you, and we want you to succeed.

209
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,400
We trust you.

210
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,440
You trust us, don't you?

211
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,520
Oh, absolutely.

212
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,580
We understand why you might still be a little hesitant.

213
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,560
There's a chance your real parents are still alive.

214
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,300
No matter how much effort we make,

215
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,260
We can never be your birth parents, but maybe...

216
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,940
There's no maybe about it.

217
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,760
Because the both of you are as real to me as my birth parents could ever be.

218
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,580
Oh, my.

219
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,100
Let's have a toast.

220
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,740
Feel like some expensive champagne, son?

221
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,400
Yeah.

222
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,600
Waiter, bring us the champagne list.

223
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,140
We're celebrating. Today's a special day.

224
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:49,780
Hello? Carl speaking.

225
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,940
Hello, Carl. It's me.

226
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,920
Do you know who this is?

227
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
Mr. Schuwalt?

228
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,440
That's correct.

229
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Now, what's this I hear about you quitting your job?

230
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,060
Uh, right, sir.

231
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
That's very disappointing

232
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:12,360
I'm sorry for any inconvenience this might cause I just hate to see you abandon your Latin

233
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,880
You put so much hard work into it

234
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,460
Thank you for your concern, sir

235
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,620
It really is a shame

236
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
I'm going to miss you, you know

237
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:30,920
As a favor to me if you don't mind would you read to me one last time sure?

238
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
It'd be my pleasure

239
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,660
How about the third chapter of From Aeolus to Lemnos?

240
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,060
Ah, a splendid choice.

241
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,720
That mysterious sea beckons for the death of even the god Phoebus.

242
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,560
What other pleasure could there be

243
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,200
than to wish death upon the sons and daughters of Cerberus?

244
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,200
Now, move forward, softly whispers Zeus.

245
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,120
Move forward, move on.

246
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,120
and dance in the temple that belongs to the dark gods,

247
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,440
the gods of Juno who dwell in the sea,

248
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,100
the earth, and the heavens.

249
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,120
From the summit of the Parthenon,

250
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,420
steal the forbidden apple of Campania

251
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,800
and bring forth the apple and everything,

252
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,420
everything to save my soul.

253
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,420
Bring forth everything to save...

254
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
My soul.

255
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:07,240
Mr. Shoevald, but your phone call.

256
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,180
Magnificent.

257
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,800
So heartfelt and meaningful.

258
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,240
The best I've heard in my whole life.

259
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,180
Why did you keep this from me?

260
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,420
Is... is that mine?

261
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,900
This rabbit's foot holds so many memories.

262
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,680
I gave it to Margo a long time ago.

263
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,700
A good luck charm.

264
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,080
I wanted to pass that luck to you.

265
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,580
This is yours, Carl.

266
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,380
My son.

267
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,000
I've put you through so much.

268
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,560
Oh, father.

269
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,860
I've found my son.

270
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:12,180
this is all thanks to one person he told me about everything his help was invaluable so

271
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:19,560
from now on he'll be working for me as my secretary he is a young man who can be trusted
