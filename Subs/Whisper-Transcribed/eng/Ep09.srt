1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,840
That looks like another scorcher today.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,660
Hey, why are you all bundled up on a hot summer day like this?

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,160
Aren't you broiling? Huh?

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,860
You're reading an old paper. That one's at least three days old.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,400
Yeah, a couple in Verdon got themselves murdered.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,440
They say a doctor did it, if you can believe that.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,760
Hey, buddy, you said you were headed for Verdun, wasn't that right?

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,760
What, you know somebody over there?

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,380
Yeah, I do.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,320
I'm not even sure if he'll still be there now.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,380
But I have to try and find him.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:28,420
We'll be right back.

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:58,420
We'll be right back.

14
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Formerly served in the French Foreign Legion,

15
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Then went freelance and fought in Nicaragua in 1979.

16
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,440
From 1981 to 1984, assisted the guerrilla rebels in Afghanistan.

17
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Then in 1987, you played a key role in the assassination of radical Islamic leaders

18
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,440
in a top secret Mossad operation.

19
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,440
It's quite an impressive resume, I must admit.

20
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Isn't it, Mr. Hugo Bernhardt?

21
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,440
I have no doubt that a mercenary of your caliber must be quite a teacher,

22
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,520
and I'm sure a number of distinguished men must have been under your instruction.

23
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,960
It might be a good idea to send some of our own officers to attend your seminar

24
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,900
and have you whip them into shape.

25
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,720
Yeah, that'd be great.

26
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,740
Incidentally, was this man here a good student by any chance?

27
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,420
I believe he showed up at your training grounds about five months ago.

28
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:04,600
we know that he is a genius with a scalpel what I'm wondering about is whether he has any talent

29
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:14,320
with a gun I don't divulge information about my pupils to anyone period of course you don't

30
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:51,480
So, have you ever trained with a gun before?

31
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,860
Uh, no.

32
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,080
I guess that means that you're self-taught, then.

33
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,480
Actually, I've never shot a gun before.

34
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,320
What? You mean not even once?

35
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,580
Right. I know I'm asking for the impossible.

36
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,080
That said, you're my only hope right now.

37
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,140
It makes no difference.

38
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,880
I make all my students forget everything they learned before they got here.

39
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,800
But this...

40
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,880
This is the first time I'll be teaching someone who's never shot a gun before.

41
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:55,060
I don't know.

42
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,260
Jump rope. Regardless of your experience or lack of, this is where everyone starts.

43
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
Now jump like that child over there.

44
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,940
Don't just stand there. Well, get started.

45
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,460
Yes, sir.

46
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,300
Faster now.

47
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:30,880
Hurry it up.

48
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,340
I said faster.

49
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,580
Balance.

50
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,180
It's all about balance.

51
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,480
Come on, faster.

52
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,140
I said faster!

53
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,160
Well, obviously I can't jump rope nearly as well as you do

54
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,400
Tell me something is this what you do, you know always supervising student training like this

55
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,860
All right, I understand you don't have to keep on staring at me like that I'll do it I

56
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Know what I have to do

57
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:05,380
Hey, it's a brambling.

58
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,740

and there she was with her mother

her mother was holding a gun

I brought the child back here with me. I couldn't just leave her.

From that moment on, she hasn't smiled once.

That's why she'll probably hate me for the rest of her life.

Remember, two shots.

Technically speaking, he was a perfect student.

123
