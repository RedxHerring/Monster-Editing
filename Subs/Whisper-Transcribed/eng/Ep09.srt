(birds chirping)

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,780
- It looks like another scorcher today.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,940
Hey, why are you all bundled up

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,660
on a hot summer day like this?

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,140
Aren't you broiling, huh?

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,960
You're reading an old paper.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,880
That one's at least three days old.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,400
Yeah, a couple in Verden got themselves murdered.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,400
They say a doctor did it, if you can believe that.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,760
Buddy, you said you were headed for Verden, wasn't that right?

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,760
What, you know somebody over there?

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,400
Yeah, I do.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,340
I'm not even sure if he'll still be there now.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,400
But I have to try and find him.

15
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,040
(inspirational music)

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,420
(rain falling)

17
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,260
(fire crackling)

18
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,980
(fire crackling)

19
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,440
Formerly served in the French Foreign Legion,

20
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,240
Then went freelance and fought in Nicaragua in 1979.

21
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,680
From 1981 to 1984, assisted the guerrilla rebels in Afghanistan.

22
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,120
Then in 1987, you played a key role in the assassination of radical Islamic leaders

23
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,500
in a top-secret Mossad operation.

24
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,640
It's quite an impressive resume, I must admit.

25
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,380
Isn't it, Mr. Hugo Bernhardt?

26
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,440
I have no doubt that a mercenary of your caliber must be quite a teacher,

27
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,520
and I'm sure a number of distinguished men must have been under your instruction.

28
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,960
It might be a good idea to send some of our own officers to attend your seminar

29
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,900
and have you whip them into shape.

30
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,720
Yeah, that'd be great.

31
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,740
Incidentally, was this man here a good student by any chance?

32
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,140
I believe he showed up at your training grounds

33
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,480
about five months ago.

34
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,360
We know that he is a genius with a scalpel.

35
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,220
What I'm wondering about is

36
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,340
whether he has any talent with a gun.

37
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,120
- I don't divulge information

38
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,140
about my pupils to anyone, period.

39
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,480
- Of course you don't.

40
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,640
(horses galloping)

41
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
(birds chirping)

42
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,460
- So, have you ever trained with a gun before?

43
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,080
I guess that means that you're self-taught, then.

44
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,460
Actually, I've never shot a gun before.

45
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,320
Hm? What? You mean not even once?

46
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,580
Right. I know I'm asking for the impossible.

47
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,060
That said, you're my only hope right now.

48
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,140
Hm. It makes no difference.

49
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,880
I make all my students forget everything they learned before they got here.

50
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,760
But this...

51
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,900
This is the first time I'll be teaching someone who's never shot a gun before.

52
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,340
(birds chirping)

53
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,260
Jump rope. Regardless of your experience or lack of, this is where everyone starts.

54
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,480
Now jump like that child over there.

55
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,920
Don't just stand there. Well, get started.

56
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,440
Yes, sir.

57
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,540
(panting)

58
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,880
Faster now, hurry it up.

59
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,340
I said faster.

60
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,180
Balance, it's all about balance.

61
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,480
Come on, faster.

62
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,900
(panting)

63
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,100
I said, faster!

64
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,280
(panting)

65
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,400
Well, obviously I can't jump rope nearly as well as you do

66
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,500
Tell me something is this what you do, you know, always supervising student training like this

67
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,020
All right, I understand you don't have to keep on staring at me like that I'll do it I

68
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,960
Know what I have to do

69
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,460
Hey, it's a Brambling.

70
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,720
I wonder if it's looking for food for its chicks.

71
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,860
[MUSIC]

72
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,560
(metal clanging)

73
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,980
- What's wrong?

74
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,260
Are you too tired to eat?

75
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,580
- Yes.

76
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,460
- You can't train if you pass out.

77
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,020
- Yes, sir.

78
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,640
(glasses clinking)

79
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,140
- Is she your daughter?

80
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,260
Or your granddaughter, maybe?

81
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,240
- Neither.

82
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,680
That little girl is the daughter of a woman I killed

83
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Shot her down right before her very eyes back in Myanmar

84
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,480
On mission in the jungle I ran into a hut for shelter and there she was with her mother

85
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,380
Her mother was holding a gun.

86
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,260
If I'd have been a fraction of a second slower,

87
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,160
it would have been me that died that day.

88
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,700
I brought the child back here with me.

89
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,980
I couldn't just leave her.

90
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,380
From that moment on, she hasn't smiled once.

91
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,480
That's why she'll probably hate me for the rest of her life.

92
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,600
That's the sort of thing that happens when you have a gun.

93
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,040
Now if you can't handle that then I'd suggest you don't carry one

94
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,760
(panting)

95
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,100
(panting)

96
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,580
What's that?

97
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,300
What a pleasant scent that is.

98
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,700
It smells just like Daphne blossoms.

99
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,540
(sneezes)

100
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,820
(sighs)

101
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,340
(gentle music)

102
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,080
- Thanks.

103
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,240
- All right, that's enough of that.

104
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,140
- Huh?

105
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,840
Time for some more running. Go.

106
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,080
Oh, yes sir. Right away then.

107
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,440
When you're done running, come to the bottom of the hill in the back.

108
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,640
Uh, what's down there?

109
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,800
The firing range.

110
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,340
The firing range...

111
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,180
Remember, two shots.

112
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,480
You have to make sure that whenever you fire your gun, you always pull the trigger twice.

113
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,500
If you can do that instinctively, it betters your chances of taking out your objective.

114
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,540
If you can't do that, then you're as good as dead. It's all over.

115
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,160
What's this about?

116
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,300
You're always preparing meals for me, so I thought it would cook for you today.

117
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,240
It's a Japanese stew of meat and potatoes. It's called Nikujaga.

118
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,420
Go on, dig in. I think you'll both enjoy it.

119
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,780
Those are chopsticks. They're carved out of wood.

120
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,840
I made them. I thought it would make our dining experience more authentic.

121
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,240
Wow! You're really good at using chopsticks, aren't you?

122
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,740
(laughing)

123
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,760
- Again, faster.

124
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,840
Aim.

125
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,340
Do it again.

126
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,640
Aim.

127
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,960
(cracking)

128
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,560
(panting)

129
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,740
(panting)

130
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,020
- What's wrong?

131
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,160
Huh?

132
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,280
It's a baby brambling.

133
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,840
I guess it fell out of its nest.

134
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,460
Huh?

135
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,360
No, wait.

136
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,700
You have to put it back.

137
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,060
That chick is going to die.

138
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,820
It's very difficult to raise them like that.

139
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,700
They rarely survive for that long outside of the nest.

140
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,420
Let's put it back.

141
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,580
Back with its mother, okay?

142
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,040
Three seconds.

143
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,360
That's all the time you've got.

144
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,200
Find your target and pull the trigger, 'cause one mistake and the slightest bit of hesitation

145
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,120
and you're dead.

146
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,960
(guns firing)

147
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,980
- Tell me, how well did he perform over those five months

148
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,440
he was there training with you?

149
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,240
- Technically speaking, he was a perfect student.

150
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,380
He built up the necessary stamina,

151
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,460
and his concentration while firing was extraordinary.

152
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,420
However.

153
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,760
- However?

154
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,660
- Being able to actually shoot a person is another story.

155
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,720
- Really?

156
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,180
- Whether or not he is successful on his first kill,

157
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,860
that's what it all comes down to.

158
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,340
Either he's got what it takes, or he doesn't.

159
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,300
- Yes, I see.

160
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,220
I wonder which road this man will choose.

161
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,960
Well, it matters not.

162
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,540
Tell me, do you have any idea where he might have gone?

163
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,720
Because if you do know where,

164
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,580
I would really like for you to tell me.

165
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,420
Thanks for all you've done for me over the past five months.

166
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,040
Here's the remaining tuition I owe.

167
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,440
And please, help yourself to the Nikujaga.

168
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,700
Again, thank you for everything

169
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,620
Damn it

170
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,200
- Oh, damn it all.

(children laughing)

172
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,280
- She's laughing.

173
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,000
- So how about it?

174
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,040
You do know where this man was heading, don't you?

175
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,420
- That I can't tell you.

176
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,420
That's fine.

177
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,960
You can go now.

178
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,120
This way, sir.
