00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:14,780
The wind blew hard, the bottle fell over, the sandwiches were covered in dirt.

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,040
That's when he smiled so sadly.

3
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,020
You look hungry. Do you want this?

4
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,320
Franz, don't bother the lady.

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,020
Uh, honey?

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,120
Thank you.

00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,860
Tasty, huh?

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,640
Start walking.

9
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,420
Into the truck.

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,200
Oh, hello. This is Eva Heinemann.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm having trouble reaching Mr. Werdemann. No one's answering his phone.

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,680
That's why I'm calling you.

13
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,760
Oh. Well, his wife just gave birth the other day,

14
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,300
so he's probably at the hospital checking in on her.

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
But he has told me about you, Ms. Heinemann.

16
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,320
Please, feel free to discuss anything you'd like with me.

17
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,720
Well, there is a matter I'd like to discuss.

18
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,500
And what is that, may I ask?

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,220
Appearing in court to testify to Tenma's innocence.

20
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,840
Oh, I see. Well, we're very grateful to hear that.

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,460
So, where are you staying at the moment?

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
Yeah, I've written down the address.

23
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,200
I should be over to your hotel in a couple of minutes.

It's all the timing.

29
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,780
They'll see me in the road, and they'll swerve and miss me.

30
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,780
And when the truck comes down this road, I fall.

31
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,580
They come, I fall.

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,080
They come, I fall.

33
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,080
I gotta get the timing floppin' just right here.

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
What is it, Helene?

39
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,160
Come on, I'm busy now.

40
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,580
So are you really going to marry me today?

41
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,220
Hey, how many times do I have to say it?

42
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,100
Of course I'm gonna do it!

43
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,900
So you really mean it?

44
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,080
You swear to God?

45
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,360
I do.

46
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,620
Today, I'd swear to anything, Helene, baby.

47
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,100
Then come and kiss me, Gustav.

48
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,860
Mm-hmm.

49
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,260
Mmm.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,160
I know how we can seal this deal.

51
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,760
Come on, get in the car.

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,420

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,260
Didn't we talk about you not doing that?

57
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,780
Nope, wasn't me.

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm here getting high off my supply while I'm practicing to make sure we pull this job off!

61
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,560
Don't make a big deal out of it, Gustav. It's an easy job. It's a piece of cake!

62
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,020
You think this is easy? I make even a little mistake and I'll be the biggest roadkill you've ever seen! I'll be dead!

63
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,460
Wait, you're gonna die?

64
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,520
Yeah! One wrong move, it's bye-bye Gustav!

65
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,900
- I don't want you to die!

- Hey, I'll be fine, I live, I was just kidding!

I still got this real big mission to take care of.

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,200
- What's that?

72
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,240
- My mission is for us to have a ton of kids together.

73
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,860
I want us to have so many kids

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,740
we can feel our own soccer team.

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,320
- Gustav, that sounds wonderful.

76
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,120
- Once I'm done with this job,

77
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,060
Then we'll both be totally set.

78
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,900
What do you say, Helene?

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,060
Will you help me complete my mission?

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,480
Mm-hmm.

81
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,540
Yes, Gustav, I will!

82
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,680
I'll have them!

83
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,800
I'll have as many children as you want, my stud muffin!

84
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,380
It's like I said earlier.

85
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,000
Now's not the time.

86
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,220
Gustav, I want to make babies!

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,340
Hey, just hold that thought for now.

It's almost time for the Detective Forrester show to come on.

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,440
Okay, the truck comes.

90
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:10,980
and fall. The truck comes, I jump out, and I fall. The truck comes, I jump out, and I fall. So when this truck comes...

91
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,140
To tell you the truth, I'm thinking of killing someone. The lovely Eva Hindemann.

92

No, you... you can't! Forget it!

93
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,760
The weather outside sure looks nice.

94
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,800
A day as fine as this and I'm stuck riding in this lousy truck.

95
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,120
And I get to share the ride with a serial murderer like you.

96
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,880
This must be my unlucky day.

97
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,120
But believe it or not, you're in luck.

98
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,780
You're thinking that this ride will be a boring transfer of yourself to another gloomy prison cell.

99
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,060
Wrong. I'm about to change that for you.

100
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,220
You're about to hear the most thrilling story of your life.

101
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,340
The twelve tales of escape that have made me a legend.

102
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,600
I will begin with my escape from Kreiner Prison. It is phenomenal.

103
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,780
Keep it to yourself!

104
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,760
Damn, these are epic. You got a better way to pass the time?

105
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,100
What time is it right now?

106
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,000
Excuse me, officer, what's the time?

107
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,860
It's 9.32 in the morning.

108
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,500
If I were free, I'd be getting ready to watch reruns of Detective Forrester on TV right about now.

109
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,200
Did you ever watch that drama?

110
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
It's a really wild series.

111
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,700
Well, it's just about time for them to be here.

112
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,240
- This job should be a real easy one to pull off.

113
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,400
You can just sit in the car and watch.

114
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,680
- What's with the gun?

115
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,140
You're not gonna use it, right?

116
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,780
- No way, Pumpkin.

117
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,580
I just brought it with to scare 'em.

118
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
- I won't have babies with you

119
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,200

120
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,360
Don't use that gun.

121
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,460
I'll even give up all the drugs.

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,200

123
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,260

124
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,980
You and me should get married.

125
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,160
I mean it this time.

126
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,260
- (gasps) Real?

127
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,560
- From now on, Gustav's going straight.

128
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,900
No more jobs where I have to carry around guns.

129
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,780
- Really?

130
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,960
- Yeah, really.

131
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,200
I'm done with jobs where I gotta pack heat.

132
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,560
- Oh, Gustav.

133
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,720
- (sighs) Damn, that feels great.

134
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,240
(laughs)

135
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,820
What a weight off my shoulders.

136
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,380

What's wrong?

144
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,900
I think I hit somebody.

145
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,900
Wait, what in the hell?

146
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,580
Hold it. You hit him?

147
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,660
Sit down, Milch. That's an order.

148
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
You hit him? But how?

149
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,340
Milch, what part of "sit down, that's an order" don't you understand?

150
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,720
That person was probably my little brother.

151
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,340
Huh?

152
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,780
I planned to free us. It didn't work.

153
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,540
Sorry, Dr. Tenma.

154
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,760
I taught Gustav the movement and timing of how to do it perfectly.

155
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,380
We worked so many hours to make sure he knew just how to fall.

156
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,440
I guess no one can stop a speeding car by falling in a road as well as I can.

157
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
He must have done a bad fall, but they still should have dodged him anyway.

158
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,620
Gustav wasn't good at it yet.

159
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,900
You could have at least tried to miss him.

160
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,480
Look, whatever you're going on about, you need to cool it.

161
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,040
Now listen, you come with us. Let's see if you really know this guy.

162
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,940
(metal clanging)

163
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,840
- Oh, Gustav.

164
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,840
I'm so sorry, Gustav.

165
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,360
(screaming)

166
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,720
- Elaine, I'm so...

167
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,300
(screaming)

168
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,340
Oh, this is bad.

169
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,420
- So, do you think he's still alive?

170
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,620
- Oh, geez, what are we gonna do?

171
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,300
- Hey, wait, I know.

172
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,140
We've got a doctor right here with us.

173
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,860
- Hey, you, get out of the truck.

174
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,280
- Yeah, get out.

175
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,300
Move it!

176
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,780
So Doc, what's the verdict?

177
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,620
Is he still alive?

178
