1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,680
Rainbow Ranger Kick!

2
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,640
Hey, that's no fair!

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,480
You're supposed to fall when I kick you!

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,620
My evil empire is going to take over the world.

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,280
Your puny little kick isn't enough to stop me.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,680
The bad guys always lose in the TV shows.

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,740
Don't you know anything?

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,660
Well, well, how's the global domination coming along?

9
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,040
Come on, Johan.

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,820
Tell them to stop breaking the rules and play the right way.

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,640
The big secret to breaking the rules

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,740
is to make it look as though you're following them.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,520
So, what sort of plans do you have for the Earth?

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,300
Who knows? Why should I care?

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,020
I'm just gonna destroy everything anyway.

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,200
Hey, messing stuff up sounds like a lot more fun than being a stupid hero.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,940
Yeah, forget being a rainbow ranger. I wanna be a villain too.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, guys, shall we start making our way back?

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
- Okay. - Come on.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,080
- So, did you have fun today? - Yeah.

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,760
Time to go home.

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:58,460
Oh, my God.

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:28,460
We'll be right back.

Finally starting to warm up a bit. That's good.

I guess.

31
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,240
Has Rosemary, uh, you know, caught any colds this winter?

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,960
Not a one. Too busy romping around with her friends to get sick.

33
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,420
That's good. She used to get those fevers like clockwork.

34
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,460
Hey, remember that one time years ago, rushing her to the doctor in the dead of night?

35
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,760
Oh. Those old pictures. You always keep them on you?

36
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,240
Of course I do. I bet she's a lot bigger now.

37
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,520
They grow up so fast, these photos of mine must be ancient history.

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,140
But still, no matter how grown up she gets,

39
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,280
I'll always know it's her the moment our eyes meet.

40
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,200
She'll always be my little girl.

41
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,220
Oh, almost forgot.

42
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,420
Whenever she's ready, please give Rosemary what's in this envelope.

43
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,460
They're newspaper clippings, mostly, and the official internal affairs report

44
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,600
from when I shot that young man who killed all those people.

45
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,100
I'm not asking you to defend me.

46
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,540
You've done that enough.

47
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,400
I shouldn't have shot him.

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,060
I'll be the first to say it.

49
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,200
I just want our daughter to know.

50
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,140
To know the truth about her old man,

51
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,420
even if it's terrible.

52
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,300
I understand.

53
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:56,340
she said either way I'll ask her again if she wants to see you if she's okay with it then so

54
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:03,620
am I really oh thank you just give me a call at the latest I'm usually home by nine o'clock

55
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:11,020
oh Richard it's good to see the old you again uh pardon that look in your eyes they shone like that

56
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,260
when you first made detective remember that fire you had in your belly when you and i first met

57
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:30,120
we both had it so what do you think if you enroll today we can get you in at a lower premium

58
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,240
the thing of it is we already have insurance we don't really need another policy let me just show

59
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,160
you our rates mr liebert that's all i ask the coverage we have right now is more than enough

60
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,540
I couldn't afford a whole new policy at the moment anyway.

61
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,820
We've had our current one for four years, ever since we moved into this neighborhood.

62
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,540
Four years, huh? Where were you living before?

63
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,300
Over near Mannheim in Bruntal.

64
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,900
Bruntal, how about that? It's a nice area.

65
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,120
So, are you folks from there originally?

66
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,220
Yeah, we are. And nice is an understatement.

67
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,340
So, do you folks have any kids?

68
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,660
A son, yes. He's attending the University of Munich.

69
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,300
Now that's what I like to hear. As it turns out, we're offering a new plan that's perfect for young adults.

70
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,140
Hear me out. This won't take a minute.

71
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,040
Aw, your son, I presume? Well, he sure was a handsome baby. What's his name?

72
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,660
His name's Johan. Would you like some tea?

73
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,140
Yeah, don't go to any trouble on my account.

74
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,500
They must keep him pretty busy at school. Seems like he hasn't called us in a long time.

75
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
Boys get like that when they leave the nest.

76
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,560
Sounds like you speak from experience.

77
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:53,120
Hello, Dr. Reifwein. I'm back.

78
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,640
Yeah, I went to Johan's folks' house.

79
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,140
That's the thing. They were normal as could be.

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,460
Totally average.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,160
Hmm. So what do you make of it, Richard?

82
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,760
Well, back in my detective days,

83
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,160
I probably would have said there's nothing fishier than normalcy or something to that effect now

84
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,740
I just don't know hard to tell at any rate. I'm going to keep checking out the people around Yohan

85
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,560
Where's the flaw nobody's that perfect

86
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:33,700
Yohan enjoyed a great reputation during his prep school days his grades were top-notch and his evaluations paint him as a model student

87
00:07:36,760 --> 00:08:05,680
But still, no matter how grown up she gets,

88
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,800
I'll always know it's her the moment our eyes meet.

89
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,720
She'll always be my little girl.

90
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,900
That baby's face in the photo.

91
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,820
There's no way he grew up to look like Johan.

92
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,220
Here you go, sir.

93
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,220
The birth certificate you asked about.

94
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,220
Ah, thank you.

95
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,220
Johann Wilhelm Liebert.

96
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,220
Date of birth, 9th of February, 1976.

97
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,220
So he was definitely born in this town.

98
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,220
Everything here reads pretty legit.

99
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,220
Mr. Hertz!

100
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,220
How many times do I have to tell you?

101
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,980
You cannot light up in here just give me an ashtray. I promise I'll smoke it real quick

102
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:13,040
No way and risk another fire like four years ago. I am NOT replacing all those damn files again, mister

103
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,380
You had to recreate your files from scratch

104
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,060
Well, yeah, we did have to ask people to resubmit their information

105
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,800
It took a while, but we're a small town. So we got all our ducks in a row again eventually

106
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,620
Hey, thank you so much for coming, Dr. Gillen.

107
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,400
Good to see you again. It's been too long, Dr. Reichwein.

108
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,200
So I'm to understand that when Dr. Tenma came to see you, he was looking for a young man he called Johan.

109
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,880
That's right, but there was no evidence with which to corroborate his story.

110
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,080
However, if the young man in this photo is the friend who manipulated my current research subject,

111
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,220
When Peter Juergens, a serial killer, into committing another murder,

112
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,220
then clues must exist that tie these three events together.

113
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,220
I'm counting on you, Dr. Gillen.

114
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,220
Right. I'll get clearance to interview Juergens as soon as possible.

115
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,220
I'll let him see this photograph and monitor any reactions.

116
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,220
If it might help prove Tenma's innocence, it's worth a try.

117
00:10:32,220 --> 00:11:02,200
Oh, my God.

118
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:13,960
So he's dead?

119
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,320
That's right.

120
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,360
The real Johann Liebert, who was born in Bruntal,

121
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,120
died when he was two years old.

122
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,340
Hold on.

123
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,960
You're saying the Lieberts replaced their dead son with someone else,

124
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,620
and after that fire destroyed the original records,

125
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,780
they used that chance to plug the other boy into that identity?

126
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,060
I'm afraid so.

127
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,260
If they did, then who's this young man masquerading as Johann Liebert, alive and well?

128
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,720
Beneath the lies, who the hell is he?

129
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:47,760
At any rate, I did pass along Johann's photograph to Dr. Gillen when he stopped in to see me.

130
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,720
Hopefully he'll get to interview that killer of his again sometime soon.

131
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,100
Now then, how about dinner?

132
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,140
Sorry, but it's getting late. Another time?

133
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,200
What's this? You run around all day and now you're working through the night as well?

134
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,160
Hardly. I'm expecting a very important phone call.

135
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,280
Cross your fingers. There's a chance I may get to see Rosemary.

136
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,520
Really?

137
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,720
Don't worry. I'm okay.

138
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,140
You're always telling me to focus on the road ahead, aren't you?

139
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,660
Hmm? Of course.

140
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,140
This is an important step in your recovery.

141
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:31,220
Yes, hello

142
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,580
Hi, Daddy

143
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,900
It's me

144
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,700
Hi, Rosemary

145
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,260
Uh-huh

146
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,140
Yeah, Daddy's fine

147
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,360
Mm-hmm

148
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,420
Of course. I'd love to see you.

149
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,560
You say when, and I'll be there.

150
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,460
Mr. Brown, it's Johan.

151
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,360
Tell me, Juergens, this young man, do you recognize him?

152
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,240
Maybe you've met him somewhere before.

153
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,120
I don't know him.

154
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,280
Hmm. This friend of yours, Johan, right?

155
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,240
You only know him through his letters. You've never actually met him. Isn't that correct?

156
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,680
But Johan certainly seemed to know a lot about you.

157
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,160
Could I borrow your pen for a moment?

158
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,180
What's that? I'm sorry. You know the rules here prohibit me from giving you anything.

159
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,600
Give me your pen.

160
00:13:49,360 --> 00:14:02,660
the park

161
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,080
that's where I was

162
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,340
killed someone the day before

163
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,360
I remember thinking

164
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm gonna stop killing people

165
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,020
I've had enough of all this

166
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,180
that's what I told myself

167
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,040
he was there

168
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,940
with a bunch of kids.

169
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,500
Uh, wait, hold on a second.

170
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,900
I should be recording this.

171
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,500
Just start over again, please.

172
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,940
Come with us.

173
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:27,680
Huh?

174
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,600
Come with us.

175
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,040
Come with us.

176
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,740
Come with us.

177
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,880
Come with us.

178
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,740
Come with...

179
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,180
Huh?

180
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:59,900
well what are you doing here we met at mr. shoe vaults estate remember Johan

181
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,960
Liebert sir I've been trying to get in touch with you but to no avail so I

182
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:17,800
figured I'd drop by yes Oh dr. Gillen it's you good

183
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,840
So, did anything interesting happen when you showed Juergens that photograph of Johan?

184
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,860
Wait, he's dead?

185
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,660
Correct. I'm at the hospital right now.

186
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,260
The police still aren't done questioning me, so I'm stuck here.

187
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,120
Listen, we lost a vital witness tonight because I was careless and handed a psychopath a ballpoint pen.

188
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,540
But I do know one thing for sure.

189
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,080
Juergens committed suicide because he saw that photograph of Johan.

190
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,820
I'll be over there as soon as I've finished up with the police, all right?

191
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,160
All right. I'll give Richard a call and let him know.

192
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,360
He'd better be home.

193
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,200
A report for class, huh?

194
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,000
That's right. On the recent UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

195
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,180
And if the treatment of juvenile offenders holds up.

196
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,360
Oh, how rude of me. Care for something to drink?

197
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,800
No thanks, I'm fine.

198
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,160
That's right, you do abstain from alcohol.

199
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,340
Yeah, probably for the best.

200
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,860
You did have quite a drinking problem.

201
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,240
I mean, you were drunk when you shot that boy, isn't that right?

202
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,440
Or, so I've heard.

203
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,100
Yes, I was. Not that it matters.

204
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,020
What I did is unforgivable, drunk or not.

205
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,200
I have a few questions about what happened, if you don't mind.

206
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,160
Tell me about the victim, Stefan Jost, age 17.

207
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,500
Of what crimes had the child been accused?

208
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,680
Don't be so naive, son.

209
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,440
Jost was a monster.

210
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,360
He was old enough to rape and murder nine women and almost killed two more.

211
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,680
So you executed him?

212
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,880
No, I didn't!

213
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,160
Right, pardon me.

214
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,500
Speaking of, Article 40 of the UN Convention states

215
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,480
every child is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty according to the law.

216
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,540
Were you familiar with that?

217
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,040
Yes, of course I was. I used to work in juvenile detention.

218
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,220
I see. And Article 37?

219
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,700
The one that goes, you cannot impose capital punishment or life imprisonment

220
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,980
without possibility of release on any person below the age of 18?

221
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,940
You knew that one?

222
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,500
the convention agreements are considered basic human rights for adults and children alike

223
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,120
what kind of a fool do you take me for you really think i planned it all out in advance

224
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,180
my shooting him was a drunken mistake look i know that what i have done can never be undone all right

225
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:55,760
and i accept the consequences of my actions mr brown allow me to explain i'm not trying

226
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,420
to antagonize you i just want to cover my topic from every angle i'm very sorry sir i really

227
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:09,680
should have used more tact. Shall we walk? The night air might do us some good. I'd like

228
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,040
to purchase the bottle, please. Just something to take the edge off of the night air.

229
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:21,880
Oh, Dr. Gillen. I keep calling him, but there's no answer. You know, Richard did say he might

230
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,040
be getting to see Rosemary soon, but this hardly seems the hour for a father-daughter

231
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,760
reunion. Well, when you finally do get a hold of him, let him know how dangerous that young

232
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:38,360
man can be and tell him that i'm en route to his apartment did you ever look into stefan jose's

233
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:45,320
background of course he grew up in an east german orphanage or something like that there's more to

234
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:53,480
it than you know his crimes were to be expected if you knew his past to a child like stefan

235
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,680
that orphanage was hell on earth he was a good boy but that didn't save him from the horror

236
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,940
That might have even made it worse

237
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,380
That orphanage devoured his mind

238
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,800
And then picked its teeth with his soul

239
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,160
The Convention on the Rights of Children, Article 6

240
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,340
The Right to Life, Survival and Development

241
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,840
Article 8, Preservation of Identity

242
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,380
Article 19, Protection from Abuse

243
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,160
To Stefan, these were so many fairy tales

244
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,120
Evil

245
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,060
There's no more fitting word for a place like that

246
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,860
I can barely speak its name aloud

247
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,840
5-1-1 Kinderheim still sends a chill down my spine.

248
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,220
So, when will you be seeing your daughter?

249
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,160
What did you say? How do you know about her?

250
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,460
Before you answered the door, you were on the phone with her. Isn't that so?

251
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,980
When do you see her? Tomorrow, maybe?

252
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,660
Enough talk. What are you up to?

253
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,620
I'm just doing research for my report. That's all.

254
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,200
No, dammit! I'm onto you, kid.

255
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,800
You're gonna tell me what you've got planned for Shuvald.

256
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,540
So who are you? Who are you? Tell me!

257
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,040
You got drunk and shot that boy to death. That's what you said.

258
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:33,660
Plenty of people did see you drinking in a bar that day, but that was after you'd already killed Stefan.

259
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:45,660
It's kind of odd, Mr. Brown. I've researched this case exhaustively, and try as I might, I can't find a single person who saw you drinking before you murdered that young man. Not a one.

260
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:52,660
Mr. Brown, this charade has gone on long enough. Were you really drunk when you pulled the trigger?

261
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,660
What?

262
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:01,760
you were quite sober and you were calm you executed Stefan Yost and you knew

263
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:11,900
exactly what you were doing did I get it right no how weak the mind when it wants

264
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:18,360
to forget maybe you didn't forget maybe you're lying is it a lie you tell

265
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,560
Tell everyone around you, or perhaps a lie you tell yourself.

266
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,460
Were you absolutely certain he committed those crimes?

267
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,380
Certain enough to put him down like a rabid dog?

268
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,040
You're guilty of murder.

269
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,820
Do you think your lies can free you?

270
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,960
That boy's blood is on your hands.

271
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,220
How are you going to look Rosemary in the eye tomorrow?

272
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,100
Isn't her daddy a coward and a murderer?

273
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,160
Hiding behind an empty bottle?

274
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,240
Well, Richard, how about a drink?

275
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,560
Huh?

276
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,940
Dr. Gillen, is that you?

277
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,900
Hmm?

278
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,580
We're the police.

279
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,600
We've come here regarding your patient, Richard Brown.

280
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,040
He's dead.
