1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,600
(children laughing)

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,680
- Rainbow ranger kick!

3
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:23,940
(laughing)

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,620
- Hey, that's no fair.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,440
- You're supposed to fall when I kick you.

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,620
(laughing)

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,620
- My evil empire's gonna take over the world.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,280
Your puny little kick isn't enough to stop me.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,700
Ugh, the bad guys always lose in the TV shows.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,740
Don't you know anything?

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,700
(laughing)

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,660
- Well, well, how's the global domination coming along?

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,920
- Come on, Johan.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,780
Tell him to stop breaking the rules and play the right way.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,400
(laughing)

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,640
- The big secret to breaking the rules

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,740
is to make it look as though you're following them.

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,520
So, what sort of plans do you have for the Earth?

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,300
- Who knows, why should I care?

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm just gonna destroy everything anyway.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,680
- Hey, messing stuff up sounds like a lot more fun

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,960
than being a stupid hero.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,880
Yeah, forget being a Rainbow Ranger, I want to be a villain, too!

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,880
Well, guys, shall we start making our way back?

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,640
- Okay. - Okay.

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,940
Come on.

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,820
- So, did you have fun today? - Yeah.

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,460
Time to go home.

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,500
[MUSIC]

30
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,020
(dramatic music)

31
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:26,220
finally starting to warm up a bit that's good i guess has rosemary uh you know uh caught

32
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,720
any colds this winter not a one too busy romping around with her friends to get sick that's

33
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,300
good she used to get those fevers like clockwork hey remember that one time years ago rushing

34
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,500
her to the doctor in the dead of night.

35
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,800
Those old pictures, you always keep them on you?

36
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,220
Of course I do. I bet she's a lot bigger now.

37
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,520
They grow up so fast. These photos of mine must be ancient history.

38
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,140
But still, no matter how grown up she gets,

39
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,280
I'll always know it's her the moment our eyes meet.

40
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,200
She'll always be my little girl.

41
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,220
Oh, almost forgot.

42
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,520
Whenever she's ready, please give Rosemary what's in this envelope.

43
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,480
They're newspaper clippings, mostly, and the official internal affairs report

44
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,580
from when I shot that young man who killed all those people.

45
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,540
I'm not asking you to defend me. You've done that enough.

46
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,080
I shouldn't have shot him. I'll be the first to say it.

47
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,440
I just want our daughter to know, to know the truth about her old man, even if it's terrible.

48
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,500
I understand.

49
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,080
As she said, either way...

50
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,820
I'll ask her again if she wants to see you. If she's okay with it, then so am I.

51
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,200
Really? Oh, thank you.

52
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,720
Just give me a call.

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,620
At the latest, I'm usually home by 9 o'clock.

54
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,920
Oh, Richard, it's good to see the old you again.

55
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,980
Uh, pardon?

56
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,800
That look in your eyes,

57
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,420
they shone like that when you first made detective.

58
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,660
Remember?

59
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,240
That fire you had in your belly when you and I first met?

60
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,520
We both had it.

61
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,040
So, what do you think? If you enroll today, we can get you in at a lower premium.

62
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,340
The thing of it is, we already have insurance. We don't really need another policy.

63
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,400
Let me just show you our rates, Mr. Liebert. That's all I ask.

64
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,460
The coverage we have right now is more than enough. I couldn't afford a whole new policy at the moment anyway.

65
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,800
We've had our current one for four years, ever since we moved into this neighborhood.

66
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,540
Four years, huh? Where were you living before?

67
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,300
Over near Mannheim in Brüntal.

68
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,880
Brüntal. How about that? It's a nice area.

69
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,140
So, are you folks from there originally?

70
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,240
Yeah, we are. And "nice" is an understatement.

71
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,340
So, do you folks have any kids?

72
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,660
A son, yes. He's attending the University of Munich.

73
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,500
Now that's what I like to hear.

74
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,300
As it turns out, we're offering a new plan that's perfect for young adults.

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,120
Hear me out. This won't take a minute.

76
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,420
Oh, your son, I presume?

77
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,060
He sure was a handsome baby. What's his name?

78
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,680
His name's Johan. Would you like some tea?

79
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,160
Yeah, don't go to any trouble on my account.

80
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,520
They must keep him pretty busy at school.

81
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,500
Seems like he hasn't called us in a long time.

82
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,520
Boys get like that when they leave the nest.

83
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,460
Sounds like you speak from experience.

84
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,100
Hello, Dr. Reiffein. I'm back.

85
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,640
Yeah, I went to Johan's folks' house.

86
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,460
That's the thing. They were normal as could be. Totally average.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,180
Hmm. So what do you make of it, Richard?

88
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,060
Well, back in my detective days, I probably would have said,

89
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,580
"There's nothing fishier than normalcy," or something to that effect.

90
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,180
Now, I just don't know.

91
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,160
Hard to tell.

92
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,880
At any rate, I'm going to keep checking out the people around Johan.

93
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,600
Where's the flaw? Nobody's that perfect.

94
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,620
Yu Hong enjoyed a great reputation during his prep school days.

95
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,720
His grades were top-notch, and his evaluations paint him as a model student.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,600
Huh?

97
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,440
But still, no matter how grown up she gets, I'll always know it's her the moment our eyes

98
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,820
meet.

99
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
She'll always be my little girl.

100
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,180
That baby's face in the photo...

101
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,820
There's no way he grew up to look like Yohan!

102
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,880
Here you go, sir. The birth certificate you asked about.

103
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,320
Ah, thank you.

104
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:49,260
"Johann Wilhelm Liebert. Date of birth, 9th of February, 1976. So he was definitely born

105
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,600
in this town." Hmm. Everything here reads pretty legit.

106
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,880
Mr. Hertz!

107
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,440
Huh?

108
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,080
Huh?

109
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,020
How many times do I have to tell you? You cannot light up in here!

110
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,060
Just get me an ashtray. I promise I'll smoke it real quick.

111
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,000
I am not replacing all those damn files again, mister!

112
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,500
You had to recreate your files from scratch?

113
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,020
Uh, well, yeah.

114
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,960
We did have to ask people to resubmit their information.

115
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,380
It took a while, but we're a small town,

116
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,640
so we got all our ducks in a row again eventually.

117
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,380
(Gasping)

118
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,600
Hey, thank you so much for coming, Dr. Gillen.

119
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,340
Good to see you again.

120
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,420
It's been too long, Dr. Reichwein.

121
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,760
So I'm to understand that when Dr. Tenma came to see you,

122
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,200
he was looking for a young man he called Johan.

123
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,880
That's right.

124
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,840
But there was no evidence with which to corroborate his story.

125
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,980
However, if the young man in this photo is the friend

126
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,100
who manipulated my current research subject,

127
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,160
one Peter Juergens, a serial killer,

128
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,720
into committing another murder,

129
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,620
then clues must exist that tie these three events together.

130
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,240
I'm counting on you, Dr. Gillen.

131
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,020
Right. I'll get clearance to interview Juergens as soon as possible.

132
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,780
I'll let him see this photograph and monitor any reactions.

133
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,220
If it might help prove Tenma's innocence, it's worth a try.

134
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,680
(dramatic orchestral music)

135
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,960
So he's dead?

136
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,320
That's right.

137
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,120
The real Johann Liebert, who was born in Brüntal, died when he was two years old.

138
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,340
Hold on.

139
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,780
You're saying the Lieberts replaced their dead son with someone else, and after that

140
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,020
fire destroyed the original records, they used that chance to plug the other boy into

141
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,780
that identity?

142
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,060
I'm afraid so.

143
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,280
If they did, then who's this young man masquerading as Johann Liebert, alive and well?

144
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,280
"Beneath the lies, who the hell is he?"

145
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,760
At any rate, I did pass along Johan's photograph to Dr. Gillen when he stopped in to see me.

146
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,720
Hopefully he'll get to interview that killer of his again sometime soon.

147
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,100
Now then, how about dinner?

148
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,140
Sorry, but it's getting late. Another time?

149
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,200
What's this? You run around all day and now you're working through the night as well?

150
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,160
Hardly. I'm expecting a very important phone call.

151
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,280
Well, cross your fingers. There's a chance I may get to see Rosemary.

152
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,520
Really?

153
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,140
Don't worry, I'm okay. You're always telling me to focus on the road ahead, aren't you?

154
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,160
Of course. This is an important step in your recovery.

155
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,100
Yes, hello?

156
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,820
Hi, Daddy. It's me.

157
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,660
Hi, Rosemary.

158
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,120
Uh-huh. Yeah, Daddy's fine.

159
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,380
Of course. I'd love to see you.

160
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,540
You say when, and I'll be there.

161
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,460
Mr. Brown? It's Johan.

162
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,380
Tell me, Juergens, this young man, do you recognize him?

163
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,260
Maybe you've met him somewhere before.

164
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,140
I don't know him.

165
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,300
Hmm. This friend of yours, Johan, right?

166
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,200
You only know him through his letters, you've never actually met him, isn't that correct?

167
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,660
But Johan certainly seemed to know a lot about you.

168
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,240
Should I borrow your pen for a moment?

169
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,300
What's that? I'm sorry, you know the rules here prohibit me from giving you anything.

170
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,680
Give me your pen.

171
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,660
The park.

172
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,300
That's where I was. Killed someone the day before.

173
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,000
I remember thinking, "I'm gonna stop killing people.

174
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,540
I've had enough of all this."

175
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,180
That's what I told myself.

176
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,940
He was there, with a bunch of kids.

177
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,520
Uh, wait, hold on a second.

178
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,480
I should be recording this. Just start over again, please.

179
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,960
Come with us.

180
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,680
Huh?

181
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,640
Come with us.

182
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,060
Come with us.

183
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,900
Come with us. Come with us. Come... with...

184
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,940
Wha... what are you doing here?

185
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,900
We met at Mr. Schuwald's estate, remember?

186
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,680
Johann Liebert, sir.

187
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,980
I've been trying to get in touch with you, but to no avail, so I figured I'd drop by.

188
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,620
Yes? Oh, Dr. Gillen, it's you. Good.

189
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,840
So did anything interesting happen when you showed Juergens that photograph of Johan?

190
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,860
Wait, he's dead?

191
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,660
Correct. I'm at the hospital right now.

192
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,260
We still aren't done questioning me, so I'm stuck here.

193
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,660
Listen, we lost a vital witness tonight

194
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,720
because I was careless

195
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
and handed a psychopath a ballpoint pen.

196
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,540
But I do know one thing for sure.

197
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,420
Juergens committed suicide

198
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,080
because he saw that photograph of Johan.

199
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:46,920
- Hmm?

200
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,500
- I'll be over there as soon as I've finished up

201
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,820
with the police, all right?

202
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,860
- All right.

203
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,140
I'll give Richard a call and let him know.

204
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,980
(phone ringing)

205
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,400
(phone ringing)

206
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,360
- He'd better be home.

207
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,820
(phone ringing)

208
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,200
- A report for class, huh?

209
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,660
- That's right.

210
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,000
On the recent UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

211
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,180
And if the treatment of juvenile offenders holds up.

212
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,180
Oh, how rude of me.

213
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,360
Care for something to drink?

214
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,800
- No thanks, I'm fine.

215
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,280
That's right, you do abstain from alcohol.

216
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,340
Yeah, probably for the best.

217
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,860
You did have quite a drinking problem.

218
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,240
I mean, you were drunk when you shot that boy, isn't that right?

219
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,460
Or, so I've heard.

220
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,100
Yes, I was. Not that it matters.

221
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
What I did is unforgivable, drunk or not.

222
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,180
I have a few questions about what happened, if you don't mind.

223
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,100
Tell me about the victim, Stefan Joos, age 17.

224
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,500
Of what crimes had the child been accused?

225
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,680
Don't be so naive, son.

226
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,440
Joos was a monster.

227
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,540
He was old enough to rape and murder nine women

228
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,360
and almost killed two more.

229
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,680
So you executed him?

230
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,880
No, I didn't!

231
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,160
Right, pardon me.

232
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,640
Speaking of, Article 40 of the UN Convention

233
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,440
states every child is presumed to be innocent

234
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,500
were you familiar with that yes of course I was I used to work in juvenile

235
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,040
detention I see and article 37 the one that goes you cannot impose capital

236
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,920
punishment or life imprisonment without possibility of release on any person

237
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,780
below the age of 18 you knew that one the convention agreements are considered

238
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,660
basic human rights for adults and children alike what kind of a fool do

239
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,460
you take me for you really think I planned it all out in advance my

240
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,180
Look, I know that what I have done can never be undone, all right?

241
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,560
And I accept the consequences of my actions.

242
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,340
Please, Mr. Brown, allow me to explain.

243
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,920
I'm not trying to antagonize you.

244
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,300
I just want to cover my topic from every angle.

245
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,560
I'm very sorry, sir. I really should have used more tact.

246
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,440
Shall we walk? The night air might do us some good.

247
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,020
I'd like to purchase the bottle, please.

248
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,040
Just something to take the edge off of the night air.

249
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,100
Oh, Dr. Gillen. I keep calling him, but there's no answer.

250
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,540
You know, Richard did say he might be getting to see Rosemary soon,

251
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,240
but this hardly seems the hour for a father-daughter reunion.

252
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,420
Well, when you finally do get a hold of him, let him know how dangerous that young man can be.

253
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,860
And tell him that I'm en route to his apartment.

254
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,800
Did you ever look into Stephan Joss's background?

255
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,960
Of course. He grew up in an East German orphanage or something like that.

256
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,020
There's more to it than you know, huh?

257
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,100
His crimes were to be expected if you knew his past

258
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,460
to a child like Stefan

259
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,080
That orphanage was hell on earth

260
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,360
He was a good boy

261
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,940
But that didn't save him from the horror that might have even made it worse

262
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,800
That orphanage devoured his mind and then picked its teeth with his soul

263
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,180
The Convention on the Rights of Children, Article 6.

264
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,340
The Right to Life, Survival, and Development.

265
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,820
Article 8, Preservation of Identity.

266
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,380
Article 19, Protection from Abuse.

267
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,140
To Stephan, these were so many fairy tales.

268
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,040
Evil. There's no more fitting word for a place like that.

269
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,840
I can barely speak its name aloud.

270
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,840
5-1-1 Kinderheim still sends a chill down my spine.

271
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,240
So, when will you be seeing your daughter?

272
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,200
What did you say? How do you know about her?

273
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,460
Before you answered the door, you were on the phone with her. Isn't that so?

274
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,020
When do you see her? Tomorrow, maybe?

275
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,640
Enough talk. What are you up to?

276
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,600
I'm just doing research for my report. That's all.

277
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,640
No, damn it. I'm on to you kid. You're gonna tell me what you've got planned for Shuvald

278
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,500
So, who are you who are you tell me

279
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,040
You got drunk and shot that boy to death that's what you said

280
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,700
"Plenty of people did see you drinking in a bar that day, but that was after you'd already

281
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,680
killed Stefan."

282
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,540
"It's kind of odd, Mr. Brown.

283
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,160
I've researched this case exhaustively, and try as I might, I can't find a single person

284
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,720
who saw you drinking before you murdered that young man.

285
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,980
Not a one."

286
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,100
"Mr. Brown, this charade has gone on long enough.

287
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,560
Were you really drunk when you pulled the trigger?

288
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,420
What?

289
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,260
You were quite sober, and you were calm.

290
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,420
You executed Stephanios,

291
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,260
and you knew exactly what you were doing.

292
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,160
No.

293
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,520
Did I get it right?

294
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,600
No!

295
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,520
How weak the mind when it wants to forget.

296
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,060
Maybe you didn't forget, maybe you're lying.

297
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,480
Is it a lie you tell everyone around you,

298
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,720
Perhaps a lie you tell yourself.

299
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,480
Were you absolutely certain he committed those crimes?

300
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,380
Certain enough to put him down like a rabid dog?

301
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,020
You're guilty of murder.

302
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,880
Do you think your lies can free you?

303
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,960
That boy's blood is on your hands.

304
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,200
How are you going to look Rosemary in the eye tomorrow?

305
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,140
Isn't her daddy a coward and a murderer?

306
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:05,260
Well, Richard, how about a drink?

307
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,580
Huh?

308
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,940
Dr. Gillen, is that you?

309
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,580
We're the police.

310
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,080
We've come here regarding your patient, Richard.

311
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,060
Richard Brown. He's dead.

312
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,600
