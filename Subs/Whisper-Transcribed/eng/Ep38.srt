"Herflig Detective Services, investigative report about Margot Langer and her death."

133
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,540
Margot Langer, whose real name was Helenka Novakova, was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia

134
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,300
on August 12, 1955.

135
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,660
In the spring of 1970, when she was 15 years old,

136
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,620
she somehow illegally gained entrance

137
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,000
into former West Germany.

138
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,420
Four years after entering Germany,

139
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,120
Margot became a high-class call girl in Munich

140
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,040
with a clientele consisting mainly of politicians

141
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,600
and influential businessmen.

142
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,260
Even though her name was secret in high society,

143
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,440
she became famous.

144
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,100
Our client in this investigation, Hans-Georg Schuwald,

145
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,660
was one of her more generous and steady patrons.

146
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,280
Oh, Father, even after it all,

147
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,800
you were still trying to find out more about Mother.

148
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,040
At age 22, she bore Mr. Schuwald a son.

149
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,780
That male child was given the name of Carl.

150
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,660
Carl, are you listening to me?

151
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,940
This is important.

Honey, I already told you, I can't go with you.

155
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,400

You have no choice!

157
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,220
If you stay with me, they'll cart you off to some orphanage!

158
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,660
Around here, people will mock you as the son of a whore!

159
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,200
Now go on!

160
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,740
What about my dad?

161
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,560
Why doesn't he help us? Doesn't he love me?

162
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,060
Why'd he abandon us?

163
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Don't hate him if he turns you away, because Mommy doesn't hate him even now.

164
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,760
I'll miss you.

165
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,600

166
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,900
Mom!

167
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,040
Her son Carl was moved around to many different sets of foster parents

168
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,720
The young man went through a lot, but eventually ended up in a loving family.

169
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,840
But he felt as if he was always... always alone in the world.

170
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,500
Of course it wouldn't say that in the report.

171
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,620
Margot Langer remained a top high-class prostitute, but retired in 1992.

172
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:43,600
Furthermore, there are rumors that Langer was involved in an affair with the president of an underground bank just before her retirement.

173
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,020
Investigating Margot's alleged affair, a lot of information was learned about this underground bank's operation.

174
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,700
This bank laundered money for Germany's black market companies for five years starting in 1991.

175
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:08,180
"Money laundering" is the term used for an organization in the business of taking illegal funds and turning them into legal currency.

176
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,920
After her retirement from prostitution, Margot Langer left Munich and lived in Offenbach-Hesse.

177
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,060
This is a picture of the apartment building that she lived in at that time.

178
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,180
She shared her third floor apartment with a young man about age 18.

179
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,940
The nature of their relationship is unknown.

180
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,360
Margot Langer lived in Offenbach for nearly four years,

181
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,060
until on November 2nd, 1996, she was found dead on Haida Street.

182
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,520
According to police files, her death was the work of a phantom killer.

183
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,560
The culprit was never found.

184
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,240
Oh, Mother.

185
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,640
Damn.

186
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,100
Margot Langer sent a letter to a close friend three months before her untimely death.

187
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,840
We were able to obtain the letter and have attached a copy to this report.

188
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,160
Oh my god, this is her handwriting.

189
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,520
I have finally retired from working and living a very peaceful life.

190
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,200
In this piece, I'm filled with thoughts of my lost son.

191
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,740
I also think about my best friend from Prague.

192
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,240
We tried to escape from Czechoslovakia together.

193
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,600
but she was captured at the border and taken back to Prague.

194
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,300
Later, I heard she gave birth to twins and was very happy.

195
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,900
Recently, I met a young man who is about the same age as my son.

196
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,420
He looks exactly like my friend in Prague.

197
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,860
When I'm with him, I feel like I'm talking to my own son.

198
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,140
I'm sure my boy has become a fine young man, just like him.

199
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,440
He must have grown up to live a happy life.

200
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,080
That's what I hope for.

201
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,680
I'm all right now, Mom.

202
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,740
And I know that I'll never feel alone again.

203
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,100
I know Dad sent me here because he wanted me to read this.

204
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,760
Now I get it.

205
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,060
I understand what she meant.

206
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,620
I understand completely.

207
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,760
It's all right.

208
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,620
I understand.

209
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,060
Damn it.

210
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,580
Every one of these doors has been locked tight.

211
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,740
Dieter, did you find a phone to call the fire department yet?

212
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,940
Yes, sir.

213
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,580
I called them.

214
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,840
How could this have happened?

215
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,700

Harder! Harder!

227
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,580

Nobody panic!

229

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,180
