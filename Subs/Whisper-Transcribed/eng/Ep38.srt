Call the fire department! Hurry!

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,560
This wasn't in the plan. I was supposed to shoot Shuval.

7
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,560
So how come there's a fire?

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,640
I get it. You changed your mind, didn't you, Johan?

9
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,080
This is better. Much better.

10
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,160
They're running around like ants, bumping into each other, trying to get out, just like ants.

Amazing. You're amazing, Johan. Amazing.

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,660
Come and watch.

13
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,100
Doc, it's pretty.

14
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,720
No! No! The books are burning!

15
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,540
Everyone is running and falling over each other.

16
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,620
without a thought for anyone but themselves.

17
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,680
And you sense it in the room.

18
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,060
The fear.

19
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:56,540
We'll be right back.

20
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:26,540
We'll be right back.

Whether or not he is successful on his first kill, that's what it all comes down to.

Remember, either he's got what it takes, or he doesn't.

23
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,340
So, have you ever trained with a gun before?

24
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,600
Uh, no.

25
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,120
I guess that means that you're self-taught, then.

26
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Actually, I've never shot a gun before.

27
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
What? You mean not even once?

28
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Right.

29
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Remember, two shots.

30
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Whenever you fire your gun, you always pull the trigger twice.

31
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,560
It betters your chances of taking out your objective.

32
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,560
If you can't do that, then you're as good as dead. It's all over.

I have to shoot you won't be able to do it I have to shoot you I'm sure you

36
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,780
You can't do it.

37
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Remember, two shots.

38
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:04,840
It can't be. I wasn't hit at all.

39
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,260
I can do this. No more shaking.

40
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,240
Johan.

41
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:30,940
Damn. The smoke's in the way.

42
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,460
Now. I have got to get him now.

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,140
You're not getting away. I won't let...

44
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:11,740
Stop pushing!

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
This side is no good!

Please! Help us!

47
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,720
Someone help us! Let us out of here!

48
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,180
Listen, do not panic. Everyone please remain calm, I beg of you.

49
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,520
Follow the directions of the security guard so that we can...

50
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,400
It's no good, sir.

51
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,480
All the doors have been locked from the outside.

52
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,040
That can't be.

53
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,360
Whatever happens, you will take Mr. Schuwald with you, understood?

54
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,080
Yes, sir.

55
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,600
So, have they found an escape route?

56
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,580
Can you tell me just where you plan on taking Mr. Schuwald in this sea of fire?

57
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,940
Come on! We must break down the door!

58
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:57,780
Right!

59
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,880
The books are burning.

60
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,240
So many of them alight.

61
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,940
The flames quickly consuming everything they touch.

62
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,540
You describe all of this with such damn calmness.

63
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,700
The flames. The chaos.

64
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,300
You're getting quite a thrill out of sharing this hellish scene with me, aren't you?

65
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,320
It's how you always sounded when you read to me, and now you're going to take my place.

66
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,420
No, I've since given up on that.

67
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,420
Something that's even more compelling has popped into my head.

68
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:49,480
You're not afraid, even now, Mr. Shugold.

69
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,820
Answer me this. Where did you come from?

70
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,720
Who are you, or what?

71
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:09,200
Can you see me now?

72
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,500
I know you can barely see anything

73
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,920
But when I'm this close to you

74
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,620
What can you see?

75
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,140
What do you see when you look into my eyes?

76
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:35,760
I was born in a town that was straight out of the fairy tale.

77
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:48,000
Many people died there, and when I walked away, I held hands with my other self.

78
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,660
To me, it seemed like we were the only two people in the world.

79
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,660
Neither one of us possessed a real name.

80
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:40,600
Hey, lady!

81
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,380
Wait, it's you.

82
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,200
Dieter, do you know this young lady?

83
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,800
Have you seen her somewhere before?

84
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,020
Huh?

85
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,780
It's burning!

86
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,740
I forgot some papers.

87
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,840
I need you to go retrieve them for me.

88
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
Go to the mansion and get them.

89
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,300
They're on the desk in the study.

90
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,100
These, huh?

91
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,200
Oh.

92
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
It's my mom.

93
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
This is…

94
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
Herflick Detective Services.

95
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,740
Investigative report about Margo Langer and her death.

96
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,740
Margo Langer, whose real name was Helenka Novakova,

97
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,740
was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia on August 12, 1955.

98
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,660
In the spring of 1970, when she was 15 years old,

99
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,020
she somehow illegally gained entrance into former West Germany.

100
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,180
Four years after entering Germany, Margot became a high-class call girl in Munich,

101
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,580
with a clientele consisting mainly of politicians and influential businessmen.

102
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,440
Even though her name was secret in high society, she became famous.

103
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,580
Our client in this investigation, Hans-Georg Schuwald, was one of her more generous and steady patrons.

104
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,780
Oh, Father. Even after it all, you were still trying to find out more about Mother.

105
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,040
At age 22, she bore Mr. Schuwald a son.

106
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,740
That male child was given the name of Carl.

107
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,940
Carl, are you listening to me? This is important.

108
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,860
Take this money and ride the train on track number five.

109
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,000
What about you, Mom?

110
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,960
Honey, I already told you I can't go with you.

111
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,400
I don't want to go alone, Mom.

112
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,560
You have no choice.

113
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,220
If you stay with me, they'll cart you off to some orphanage.

114
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,660
Around here, people will mock you as the son of a whore.

115
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,200
Now go on.

116
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,760
What about my dad?

117
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,620
Why doesn't he help us?

118
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,560
Doesn't he love me?

119
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,040
Why did he abandon us?

120
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,580
Don't hate him if he turns you away.

121
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,880
because Mommy doesn't hate him even now.

122
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,740
I'll miss you.

123
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,660
Mom!

124
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,220
Mom!

125
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,080
Her son Carl was moved around to many different sets of foster parents.

126
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,320
The young man went through a lot,

127
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,700
but eventually ended up in a loving family.

128
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,880
but he felt as if he was always, always alone in the world.

129
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,540
Of course it wouldn't say that in the report.

130
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,660
Margot Langer remained a top high-class prostitute, but retired in 1992.

131
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,580
Furthermore, there are rumors that Langer was involved in an affair

132
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,600
with the president of an underground bank just before her retirement.

133
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,380
This information has not been confirmed.

134
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:53,700
In investigating Margot's alleged affair, a lot of information was learned about this

135
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,920
underground bank's operation. This bank laundered money for Germany's black market companies for

136
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,800
five years starting in 1991. Money laundering is the term used for an organization in the

137
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,820
business of taking illegal funds and turning them into legal currency. After her retirement

138
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,940
from prostitution. Margot Langer left Munich and lived in Offenbach, Hesse. This is a picture of

139
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,560
the apartment building that she lived in at that time. She shared her third floor apartment with

140
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,540
a young man about age 18. The nature of their relationship is unknown. Margot Langer lived in

141
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:38,060
Offenbach for nearly four years until on November 2nd, 1996, she was found dead on Haida Street.

142
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,280
according to police files her death was the work of a phantom killer the

143
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:51,800
culprit was never found Oh mother damn Margot Langer sent a letter to a close

144
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,980
friend three months before her untimely death we were able to obtain the letter

145
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,860
and have attached a copy to this report

146
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:13,480
Oh my god, this is her handwriting.

147
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,560
I have finally retired from working and living a very peaceful life.

148
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,980
In this peace, I'm filled with thoughts of my lost son.

149
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,760
I also think about my best friend from Prague.

150
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,980
tried to escape from Czechoslovakia together but she was captured at the

151
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,400
border and taken back to Prague. Later I heard she gave birth to twins and was

152
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:49,000
very happy. Recently I met a young man who was about the same age as my son. He

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,160
looks exactly like my friend in Prague. When I'm with him I feel like I'm

154
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:03,780
talking to my own son I'm sure my boy has become a fine young man just like

155
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:13,040
him he must have grown up to live a happy life that's what I hope for

156
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:22,800
I'm all right now mom and I know that I'll never feel alone again I know dad

157
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,960

161
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,140
How could this have happened?

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,020
What the hell's going on in there?

163
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,440
- Get in the car!

164
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,280
