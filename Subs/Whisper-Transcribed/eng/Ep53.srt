1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,500
Tell Helene and Gustav that I'm counting on them to tape Detective Forster, the crime

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,340
drama on television right now.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:10,640
Huh?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,580
It's my favorite show.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,280
I'm addicted.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,900
The reruns are on at ten on Tuesday mornings.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:16,740
Tune in.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,920
You might learn something.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,980
Come on, Mills.

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,940
Will you get serious?

11
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,240
You shouldn't be kidding around right now.

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,540
The boss isn't happy with your sloppy work.

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,020
Do you have any idea how much trouble you caused by screwing up and getting yourself

14
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,380
caught?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,640
If you are a complete idiot, the boss still sent me here to be your legal counsel.

16
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,140
So how about showing him a bit of gratitude?

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,440
Come on, who do you think you're kidding? You're here to keep an eye on me so I don't spill the beans, right?

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,500
I won't deny it. Listen up, Milch.

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,900
I presume you are aware of what would happen if you were to say anything, well, aren't you?

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,580
What are you so worried about? I'd never rat on any of my buddies.

21
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:00,160
That's very smart. I need you to stick to the scenario that I laid out for you and confess, all right?

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,720
All right. So has my next job been decided? I'd kind of like to prepare for it.

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,420
What do you mean next job? Given your present situation, you won't be getting out of prison anytime soon.

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,380
Yeah? How can you be so sure?

25
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:12,900
What?

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,320
Think about it. Did you forget who I am? I'm Gunter Milch, King of Prison Escapes.

27
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,820
*Sigh*

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,500
I'm getting way behind schedule, so just stop the nonsense.

29
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,580
If you follow the blueprint I'm drawing up and confess, you'll get out in about five years.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,900
And don't forget to talk to them about that favor.

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,480
Huh?

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,100
I told you to tell Helene and Gustav to tape Detective Forster while I'm in lockup.

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,460
Hmm...

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,500
Yeah, but they're not very reliable, are they?

35
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,640
I may have to try it one more time while I'm still at this station jailhouse.

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,400
(evil laughter)

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,620
(choral music)

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,620
(rock music)

39
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,620
[MUSIC]

40
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,840
I don't know he's hard to figure but I did see blood in his vomit and you can feel his body's really cold

41
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,460
Hey, don't throw up in the hallway doctor. Oh, you came just in time. I'm glad you're here

42
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,860
Uh-huh. Keep an eye on this place for a bit

43
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,480
They just brought in a few young punks who went berserk on the third floor

44
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,140
Some people were injured so I need to get up there right away doc

45
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,090
This guy looks like he's gonna die at any moment

46
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,260
You back again Milch just put him on a bed over there. I'll take a look at him later

47
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,720
You'd better get me to a hospital right away before I die!

48
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,300
You'll be fine. I won't be gone long.

49
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,280
Damn, all of a sudden it's getting busy in here today.

50
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,480
Give me a break! You can't put me next to a serial killer!

51
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,600
I know my rights! I demand another bed! Why is he even here?!

52
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,480
The man's refused his meals and collapsed from starvation.

53
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,160
He's hooked up to an IV.

54
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,060
- Oh, I feel a lot worse just being next to him, see?

55
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,360
- Just lie there and be quiet.

56
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,720
- Doctor, you said some people were injured.

57
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you have any idea how many?

58
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,680
- That's what I'll find out as soon as I get there.

59
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,560
- Wait till I get my hands on them.

60
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,400
Those punks are gonna do a hard time

61
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,360
when they're here with me.

62
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,460
- I've been thinking about what you said the other day.

63
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,700
I need you to help me.

64
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,640
I have to get out of here.

65
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,620
I'm thinking of killing someone.

66
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,720
I'm thinking of killing your former fiancée,

67
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,860
the lovely Eva Heinemann.

68
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,040
So, what do you think?

69
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,920
Personally, I like the idea very much.

70
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,680
You know, she's dangerous.

71
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,800
She knows a little more than she should.

72
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,140
That rainy night at the building, the one under construction,

73
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,640
she heard three distinct gunshots.

74
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,720
And she saw someone as well.

75
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,860
It was him.

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,020
Now we don't need people like her complicating things.

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,460
We really don't, don't you agree?

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,640
No, you... you can't!

79
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,440
It's not an option Ava would never even think to testify about that

80
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,860
All she wants is to get back at me to make me regret and suffer. She's mad that I left her

81
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,600
She wants me to spend the rest of my life behind bars for that. She'll only testify to things that will hurt me

82
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Do you understand so?

83
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,620
So so that's why you need to take a little more time to consider my idea

84
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,900
She'll be out of the way once and for all and you may not have to go to prison if she's not on the witness

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,400
(dramatic music)

86
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,360
This could be very good for both of us.

87
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,700
Elimination is the winning choice,

88
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,120
no matter how you look at it.

89
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,720
I mean, what other options do you have?

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,980
If you go to the police,

91
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,360
they won't believe you, an accused murderer.

92
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,740
What are you gonna do, tell Mr. Vertimon?

93
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,080
I wouldn't.

94
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,340
I mean, think about it.

95
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,200
He could be one of us.

96
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,260
Who really knows?

97
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,460
We'll make sure you're found innocent. After all, that's what we brilliant Defense Attorneys do.

98
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,140
And once you're free and moved out of this place, you should have yourself a drink to celebrate.

99
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,340
Because by that time, that miserable, stuck-up, loud-mouthed bitch will be long gone from this world.

100
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,280
Never, ever to be seen again.

101
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,220
I

102
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,920
Want to escape

103
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,260
Hey get me out of here, I'm allergic

104
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,040
I can't sleep with this serial murderer next to me button it milch quit all that squawking

105
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,680
I buttoned it you button it as everyone got all their buttons now. Hey knock it off

106
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,100
They'll be moving me out of this holding station in five days

107
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,440
Then it's goodbye forever to serial murderers like you!

108
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,140
What's all the rocket for, huh?

109
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,500
Pretty fast recovery.

110
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,880
Yeah, just another one of your fake-outs.

111
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,740
I'm gonna be rid of you.

112
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,680
In five days, I'm done looking at your miserable face!

113
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,920
You're a real piece of work, Milch.

114
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,760
Enough already!

115
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,300
Just five more days to go.

116
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,400
So, on that particular rainy night,

117
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,200
from inside a building under construction you heard three gunshots,

118
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,920
and soon afterwards saw a young blonde man come hurrying down the stairs.

119
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,300
Is that correct, Miss Heinemann?

120
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,760
That's right.

121
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,040
Now what's the plan? Are you still proceeding with the case and denying Johan's existence?

122
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,440
I… I don't know.

123
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,740
Listen, Ms. Heinemann,

124
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,520
if I called upon you,

125
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,260
would you be willing to testify to this in open court?

126
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,660
No, I would not.

127
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,380
What could Dr. Tenma possibly want this late at night?

128
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,880
Would you kindly tell us what this is all about?

129
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,100
Well, I don't exactly know. He just asked to see you right away.

130
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,560
So what did you want to talk to us about, Dr. Tenma?

131
00:09:53,420 --> 00:10:02,640
At Dusseldorf's Eisler Memorial Hospital there was the Director, Dr. Heinemann, the Chief

132
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,060
of Surgery, Dr. Oppenheim, and then Dr. Boyer as well, along with one Adolf Junkers, who

133
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,380
It was a patient of mine at the time.

134
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,020
It was me, I confess.

135
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,280
I did it. I killed every one of them.

136
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:54,200
The wind blew hard, the bottle fell over, the sandwiches were covered in dirt.

137
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,400
That's when he smiled so sadly.

138
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,780
According to this announcement made by the police,

139
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,600
murder suspect Kenzo Tenma confessed shortly before dawn.

140
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,520
Up until now, he had relentlessly kept silent about all the charges against him.

141
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,540
Now, in regard to the killing of the director of Eisler Memorial Hospital in Dusseldorf

142
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,220
and two other doctors, as well as the murder of Adolf Junkers,

143
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,760
he has admitted that he committed these crimes.

144
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,160
But that can't be!

145
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,320
This is breaking news.

146
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,620
He confessed? Why would he?

147
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,460
Kenzo Tenma, who had previously maintained total silence about the charges,

148
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,980
surprised authorities with his unexpected confession to the string of serial killings.

149
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,100
I want the truth!

150
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,480
Hey, what the hell did you idiots do to Tenma?!

151
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,140
What method of torture did you subject him to in order to obtain that false confession?!

152
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Please take your hand off me and calm down.

153
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,300
I am calm, dammit! Just take me to Dr. Tenma!

154
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,420
I'll talk to him myself and find out what kind of treatment he received during his questioning!

155
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,120
It's useless, Dr. Reitwein.

156
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,760
I've already tried. He won't even see me, his own lawyer.

157
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,340
It would appear that his confession was completely voluntary, without any coercion.

158
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,940
But that's impossible!

159
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,520
I did a little research. It turns out that his interrogators are men I know personally.

160
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,680
And these are men who would never condone the use of torture.

161
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,720
Tenma summoned them both when he made his declaration.

162
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,120
Then he proceeded to willingly admit his guilt.

163
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,300
Wait, Mr. Werdemann. You're actually suggesting his confession to the murders is genuine?

164
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,560
How can I even begin to tell what he intended when he won't meet with me?

165
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,320
Mr. Werdemann, you've got to believe.

166
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,720
Dr. Tenma didn't commit murder.

167
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,720
I still believe he's innocent.

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,840
Hello, this is Werdemann.

169
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,860
Oh, Mr. Ball.

170
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,320
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be there, but some urgent business came up that couldn't wait.

171
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,560
That's all right.

172
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,860
How did it go? Were you able to talk to Dr. Temma?

173
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,440
No. He refused to have anything to do with me.

174
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,960
What can I say? I'm stunned.

175
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,660
Here we are in the middle of an effort to prove his complete innocence,

176
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,920
working hard to get them to drop all the charges they have against him,

177
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,660
then he breaks down and fully confesses.

178
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,440
In that regard, your father was very admirable.

179
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,620
No matter how unbearable his interrogation got, he never once capitulated.

180
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,000
Your father held steadfast to his innocence.

181
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,040
And he was innocent.

182
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,700
So then, any idea of what we should do now to help out Temma?

183
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,080
Mr. Vertema?

184
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,940
Anyhow, that woman, the key person who could prove Dr. Temma's innocence, what did you say her name was?

185
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,140
Oh, Eva Heinemann.

186
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,120
Right, and where is she now?

187
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,760
She's staying at a local hotel.

188
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,980
I'd certainly like to meet her and hear what she has to say.

189
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,580
Well, she can be a pretty difficult lady.

190
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,640
I think for now I'll try meeting with her again myself.

191
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,340
Were you admirable, father?

192
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,380
(waves crashing)

193
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,000
(somber music)

194
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,080
- Miss Heinemann, it's Fritz Werdemann.

195
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,300
Could you open the door?

196
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,740
I'd like to speak to you for a moment.

197
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,620
Look, you might as well let me in.

198
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,540
I know perfectly well you're in there drinking

199
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,220
because the maid's been trying to get in

200
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,760
day to tidy up the place.

201
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,580
Miss Heinemann, I fully understand that you have reasons to despise Dr. Tenma.

202
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,580
Your father's death was a big loss for you to bear, but if your relationship with Tenma

203
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,860
had continued, it would have helped heal the pain of that event and made your life easier.

204
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,220
When he broke off your relationship, you felt very alone.

205
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,720
Your life was thrown into turmoil, and you blamed Tenma for that.

206
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,300
"I'll tell you about my father.

207
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,700
They sentenced him to 20 years for espionage and murder.

208
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,380
For a very long time I was called 'son of a spy.'

209
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,680
Fingers were pointed at me and I was shunned.

210
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,920
My father's actions threw my life into turmoil.

211
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,380
But all that stuff didn't really bother me.

212
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,780
Would you like to know why?

213
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,840
Would you like to know how I was able to endure and keep on fighting?

214
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:27,040
It was because I believed, I truly believed.

215
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,100
My father is innocent.

216
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,960
My father is innocent.

217
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,700
He was innocent.

218
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,080
He was innocent.

219
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,100
For me to represent someone, I must first believe they are truly innocent!

220
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,700
I'm going to prove Dr. Tenma's innocence!

221
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,680
Tenma has to be innocent!

222
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,080
Just like my father!

223
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,580
Just like my father!

224
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,100
You must believe it! You must believe!

225
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,340
I'm leaving you phone numbers for my partner and myself.

226
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,120
When you're ready to testify, please give us a call.

227
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,220
What are you saying?

228
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,820
He's being transported to the detention center tomorrow?

229
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,560
He's only been here a few days.

230
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,780
Why is he being rushed off?

231
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,740
That is standard police procedure after someone willingly confesses.

232
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,380
Well can't we do something to delay it, Mr. Werdemann?

233
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,520
The police have been trying to convince Dr. Tenma to meet with us, but so far they haven't

234
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,200
had any luck.

235
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,800
Is Miss Heinemann there by any chance?

236
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,600
No, she went out.

237
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,940
For all I know, she's probably gone off to get drunk at some bar again.

238
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,380
Dusseldorf...

239
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,540
I remember all these places. Nothing has changed.

240
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,060
I despise this town.

241
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,040
(dramatic music)

242
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,460
- Oh, did you just get here?

243
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,440
- I've been sitting here staring at you

244
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,520
for the last five minutes.

245
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,060
I'm sorry, but I've never seen anything more interesting than this book.

246
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,560
I just had to write some of it down.

247
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,780
Do you want to go somewhere else to get a bite to eat?

248
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,480
Maybe you'd like some kind of foreign cuisine?

249
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,120
Italian might be good.

250
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,360
How about French?

251
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,100
Where would you like to go? You name it.

252
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,180
Don't let me tear you away from your book.

253
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,420
Why don't you just keep on reading?

254
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Wait! Eva!

255
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,040
I didn't mean to...

256
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:10,880
Eva!

257
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,580
(dramatic music)

258
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,520
- This sandwich is the bestest ever!

259
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,860
(laughing)

260
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,340
- You brought your appetite.

261
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,100
Pretty good, huh?

262
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,480
(laughing)

263
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,260
- What are you doing?

264
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,200
- Holding it down.

265
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,980
There's a rock on the edge of the blanket, so it won't blow away in the wind.

266
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,740
That wasn't what I meant. I'm wondering why you're putting down a blanket at all.

267
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,480
It's fun having lunch out here every once in a while.

268
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,080
And the weather's nice, too.

269
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
And who would be having this lunch?

270
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,940
The two of us, of course. I made my favorite sandwiches. I hope you'll like them.

271
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,540
There are bugs everywhere.

272
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,660
It'll be all right.

273
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,060
They've all got dirt on them now. I'm afraid they're ruined.

274
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,060
You look hungry. Do you want this?

275
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,240
Franz, don't bother the lady.

276
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,080
Uh, honey?

277
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,960
Here.

278
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,180
Thank you.

279
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,620
Tasty, huh?

280
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,620
Start walking.

281
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,180
(feet clomping)

282
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,580
- Into the truck.

283
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,000
- Oh, hello.

284
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,460
This is Eva Heinemann.

285
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,620
I'm having trouble reaching Mr. Werdemann.

286
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,960
No one's answering his phone.

287
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,660
That's why I'm calling you.

288
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,580
- Oh.

289
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,180
Well, his wife just gave birth the other day,

290
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,700
at the hospital checking in on her.

291
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,400
But he has told me about you, Ms. Heinemann.

292
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,720
Please, feel free to discuss anything you'd like with me.

293
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,460
- Well, there is a matter I'd like to discuss.

294
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,440
- And what is that, may I ask?

295
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,080
- Appearing in court to testify to Tenma's innocence.

296
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,580
- Oh, I see.

297
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,920
Well, we're very grateful to hear that.

298
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,480
So, where are you staying at the moment?

299
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,340
I should be over to your hotel in a couple of minutes.
