1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,260
She has a baby back there, and the Neo-Nazis are planning to burn the town!

2
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,520
A Turkish woman was found dead up on the third floor.

3
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,980
We're approaching the meeting place where Johan will be expected.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,060
You I'm not sure what'll happen there. You do know how to use that gun, right?

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,180
Calvin Street Frankfurt now my plans have changed why the sudden change of heart. What about killing Johan?

6
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,540
I'll deal with him later now do as I say general wolf will be disappointed to hear this news

7
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,180
He personally requested that you kill Johan. He believed you were the man for the job. I don't care

8
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:02,680
I don't take requests from anyone. I'm gonna kill Johan of my own accord. Now hurry up and get to Calvin Street

9
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,900
(dramatic music)

10
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,940
(eerie music)

11
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,820
- All ignition points are ready to go, sir.

12
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,060
Well done. Time to celebrate our superiority with a little firepower.

13
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,260
Hail!

14
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,440
Now...

15
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,700
What are we going to do with them?

16
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,820
These two are an insult to our race. Unfortunately, these types do exist among us.

17
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,420
One is a thief, and the brat was trying to save the Turks.

18
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,240
They're both filthy scum. Purify them.

19
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,460
It's time to teach him a lesson.

20
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,780
This place is going to burn anyway. Leave them for the flames.

21
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,640
Oh, come on, little one. Don't cry.

22
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,280
Your mama's coming back real soon.

23
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,940
Aishe!

24
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,720
I can't believe you're still alive.

25
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,980
How'd you find me?

26
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,320
It's all thanks to Dieter. He told me that you lived in this building.

27
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,300
Did you say Dieter? So then it's true, you're that Tenma guy he was talking to me about the other day.

28
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,220
Where is Dieter? Didn't he come by?

29
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,720
No.

30
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,440
Then where'd he go?

31
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,160
Hey, have you seen Aishe?

32
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,720
This baby is Aishe's little boy. He needs her. He misses his mom a lot.

33
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,000
It can't be. No, it's not possible. I don't believe it.

34
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:12,360
child he's too young to be without a mother what am i going to do what do i do

35
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,820
she's the last there mustn't be any more victims

36
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,300
i need to see the leaders of the turkish quarter now

37
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,720
so what does everyone think set the town on fire huh not likely we hear rumors about the

38
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,320
We can't overreact every time they threaten us.

39
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,500
What's even more suspicious to me is this Japanese guy waltzing in here,

40
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,180
though he says his life is in danger.

41
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,960
What's the matter with all of you? Aishe is dead. Don't you get it?

42
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,800
She was killed because she tried to warn all of us about this danger.

43
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,100
I wonder about that.

44
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,180
She was a prostitute like you, right?

45
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,800
You women go off with Germans all the time and end up missing.

46
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,100
That's nothing new.

47
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,500
You make all us Turks look bad.

48
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,240
I don't even know whose kid that is, anyway.

49
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,440
You all know how hard it is to make a living.

50
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,440
You should know better than to act like this.

51
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,000
If you want to live, then you've got to listen to me.

52
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,180
Forget it! Do what you want!

53
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,580
You can burn and go to hell for all I care!

54
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,260
Now wait just one second.

55
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,260
Are you suggesting patrol groups?

56
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,560
Maybe we should do as this Japanese man says.

57
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,900
We have nothing to lose.

58
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,900
Are you really going to listen to some Asian we don't know?

59
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,200
He might be suspicious,

60
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,300
but there are certainly plenty of trustworthy Japanese people in the world.

61
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,880
General Nogi, for example.

62
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,040
General Nogi? Who's he?

63
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,240
You mean you don't know about him?

64
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,140
General Nogi was a brave Japanese man who saved the Turkish navy

65
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,620
when they were lost in the Pacific years ago.

66
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,680
Oh.

67
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,000
Go ahead and gather all our men immediately.

68
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,860
It looks so delicious.

69
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,120
Let's dig in, shall we?

70
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,780
No need to be in such a hurry, ladies. Take your time.

71
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,780
We wouldn't want to finish eating before the entertainment.

72
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,420
I planned it so by the time the main course comes around,

73
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,240
the show will be reaching its climax.

74
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,960
In the meantime, let's enjoy this 76 Chateau Latour

75
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:46,200
The first dish we will indulge in is my favorite raw flounder with caviar and as the feast

76
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,560
begins...

77
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:47,740
Oh!

78
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,400
Voila!

79
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,140
The first fire!

80
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,140
What a wonderful start!

81
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,440
But like I told you, that's still just an appetizer.

82
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,500
Where is the main course?

83
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,640
Remember what I said, don't be impatient.

84
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,280
Savor your dinner. My show will be something you'll truly enjoy.

85
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,180
Tell me where the main course is.

86
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,400
If that's an appetizer, then what are you going to burn for the main course?

87
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,100
We need more fire extinguishers!

88
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,720
We need to spread out! The rest of you men, come with me!

89
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,260
It's just as I thought. The flames started upwind.

90
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,000
This whole place could go up! Three groups, save the women and children!

91
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,580
What a lovely surprise, and to what do we owe this honor?

92
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,200
- Why, you-- - Don't even try it!

93
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,120
Or kiss your boss goodbye.

94
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,300
Put that dangerous thing away.

95
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
Why don't we enjoy this meal together?

96
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,480
Unfortunately, it seems your appetizer is fizzling out.

97
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,080
Don't worry.

98
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,380
That was just the beginning.

99
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,900
This is your favorite, right?

100
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
Sorry about that.

101
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,580
Don't be so contrary, my dear.

102
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,980
You see, after all, this is a great celebration in honor of Johan.

103
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,940
Listen to me. Johan doesn't want any of this.

104
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,720
Oh? And tell me, how can you be so certain?

105
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,020
I saw it with my own eyes.

106
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,760
I followed his messages. I know what he wants.

107
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,140
Huh?

108
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,820
Johan doesn't care about your plans.

109
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,280
So, what exactly did you see?

110
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,440
Yohan, he doesn't want any of this. Don't you understand?

111
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,760
You're right. Okay. Relax. Calm down. Just take it easy.

112
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,000
Aishe is dead because of you. I won't let anybody else die tonight.

113
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,440
So where's the main course? What part of town are you going to set on fire?

114
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,680
Damn it! They started fires where the fire trucks can't get to!

115
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,960
- Take the injured to the shelters, I'll be right there!

116
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,020
- Tenma!

117
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,660
- Well, have you had any luck finding Dieter?

118
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,260
- Someone told me they saw a kid who looked like him

119
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,640
near the park around noon.

120
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,040
- Dieter, my God.

121
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,060
[screaming]

122
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,140
- Hey!

123
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,380
to go after her and try and bring her back?

124
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,300
No. Let's just continue with my dinner as planned.

125
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,380
That girl sure is something.

126
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,680
I suppose it must run in the family.

127
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,060
The look she had in her eyes...

128
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,360
She was really going to kill me.

129
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,040
It's a good thing she didn't realize

130
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,980
how close I was to giving her the actual location of the main course.

131
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,260
Well, shall we bring out the next dish, sir?

132
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,220
No. Get me some underwear first.

133
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,140
A scary girl, isn't she?

134
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,300
Hang on! I'll put it out!

135
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,220
You made it. You're going to be just fine.

136
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,880
Everything's okay, alright?

137
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,540
I got no idea who you are, lady, but thanks for getting us out of there.

138
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,620
How did the two of you end up here, anyway?

139
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,660
Well, I...

140
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,860
You wanna know what happened, lady?

141
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,220
This brat almost got me killed!

142
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,020
Forget this. I'm getting the hell out of here.

143
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,600
This fire, though skinhead-set, I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

144
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,140
I grew up in this neighborhood. I know the place like the back of my hand.

145
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,260
If I wanted to burn down the town, this wouldn't be the spot, believe you me.

146
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,520
This town ain't out of the woods just yet.

147
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,920
There were three other fires upwind that were also put out.

148
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,200
We can't thank you enough for your help. Right, everyone?

149
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,320
If it weren't for you, this all could have been a whole lot worse.

150
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,800
Our next step is to take care of the injured.

151
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,300
No. I won't have any more victims. Not one more.

152
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,000
Wait. What are you talking about?

153
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,160
Well, the wind's gonna change direction.

154
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,480
It always happens every night around this time. The wind just stops.

155
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,340
Then it starts blowing towards town from where the river is.

156
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,520
(dramatic music)

157
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,900
- The wind, it's stopped.

158
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,620
- And now, time for the main course to be served.

159
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,140
(men laughing)

160
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
- You see them running away?

161
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,760
- Allow me to buy this round.

162
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,500
- Okay, that should take care of it.

163
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,240
- Thanks for patching me up, Doctor.

164
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,820
you a drink what are you talking about you have to take it easy for a while oh

165
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,600
come on loosen up doctor right that's right it's thanks to you you were able

166
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,060
to put out those fires and save the neighborhood I bet those neo-nazis are

167
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,180
scratching their heads right now wondering what the hell happened no

168
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:38,560
doubt they are that'll teach them never underestimate the Turks the mosque by

169
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,280
- Hey, Dr. Tenma, take a break and relax.

170
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,300
Come on, why don't you have a drink with us?

171
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,640
- Not until everyone's taken care of.

172
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,920
- If all of the fires up until now were just diversions,

173
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,200
where do you think they're going to light the real fire?

174
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,780
- How the hell would I know?

175
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,920
Who cares about this stupid town anyway?

176
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,340
Besides, there's something much more important on my mind

177
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,740
that I gotta take care of.

178
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,040
- Wait! I need you to tell me, and I need you to tell me now!

179
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,820
Where would you start the real fire?

180
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,680
Get your hands off of me!

181
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,000
Like I already told you, the wind's gonna come from the river.

182
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,280
The abandoned factory down there would be a perfect place for a fire.

183
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,220
If I'm not mistaken, there should still be a bunch of chemicals in the warehouse.

184
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,760
At long last, something I can sink my teeth into.

185
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,340
Yes, this is going to be delicious.

186
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,860
We're right on schedule.

187
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,500
The celebration of the Master Race is about to begin.

188
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,040
It's you. Why did you follow me?

189
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,000
Because I have to put out the fire.

190
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:08,880
Tenma!

191
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,360
Tenma...

192
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,060
This is it! It's the warehouse!

193
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,880
Thank goodness. Looks like they haven't found this place yet.

194
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,680
These are all filled with chemicals?

195
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,420
If all of this were to go up, it'd be hopeless. There'd be nothing left of the town.

196
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,480
I'll protect this place no matter what.

197
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,040
I'm not gonna let those horrible people burn it down.

198
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,460
Are you okay?

199
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,380
I slipped.

200
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,160
What the heck is this?

201
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,000
Smells like gasoline.

202
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,200
It looks like... someone's there.

203
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,140
It's alright, I'm fine.

204
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,800
Let's get you to a shelter so I can have a closer look at it.

205
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,700
I twisted my ankle. It probably happened when I was trying to get away from the fire.

206
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,020
Now that I finally got this rug, who gives a damn about this stinking town?

207
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,520
I bet I can probably get 800,000 marks for this baby. No, a million!

208
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,340
Heckle!

209
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,460
What happened to Dieter?

210
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,120
Where is he? Where'd he go? What happened to him?

211
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,260
Last I saw, he was going to the abandoned warehouse by the river.

212
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,560
Why there?

213
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,320
The wind's gonna blow in from the river soon.

214
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,840
So if the chemicals in that warehouse are set on fire, it's all over for this town.

215
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,380
This is what I was talking about!

216
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,920
Tell everyone to evacuate from the riverside shelters right away! Go!

217
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,220
Huh? You're going to take me there, huh?

218
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,200
Who is it? Who's back there?

219
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,420
[footsteps]

220
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,860
Freeze! Don't move!

221
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,740
Can it be true? Are you really Yohan's sister?

222
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,360
Put the lighter down now!

223
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,600
Once I set this trail of gasoline on fire,

224
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,920
is going to go up in an instant.

225
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,620
I'm going to shoot you in the head before that happens!

226
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,960
I can fire quicker than you can flick that lighter,

227
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,300
and I'm not afraid to do it!

228
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,780
And what if you miss?

229
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,780
I haven't skipped a day of training in six months straight.

230
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,060
So I know I can hit you from here.

231
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,480
You don't frighten me.

232
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,020
Don't you know this is a celebration of the Master Race?

233
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,220
This is our big welcome for Johan.

234
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,280
But Johan doesn't want any of the things you want!

235
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,100
Yes, it's true that he was recently seen here,

236
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,620
But the only reason he came was to kill one of your leaders and all of his subordinates.

237
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,960
He left a message behind, you know.

238
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,680
What message?

239
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,400
Listen to me. Johan is not the person you think he is.

240
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,980
The truth is much more complex than that.

241
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,480
What are you trying to say?

242
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,740
It's worse. It must be terrifying for him.

243
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,760
He's suffering. He's in anguish and teetering on the edge of despair.

244
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,460
[crash]

245
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:40,880
[footsteps]

246
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,460
Eh.

247
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,940
You know, I'm not so sure it's such a good idea

248
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,560
to be making enemies of these guys.

249
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,940
Which way to the warehouse?

250
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,480
I didn't sign on for all of this.

251
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,900
I'm gonna call it a day. See ya.

252
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,420
Where the hell do you think you're going?

253
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,580
Are you just going to let Dino die like that?

254
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,880
Tell me where the warehouse is!

255
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
That's right, I'll tell you, I'll tell you!

256
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,260
Just let me go, you're choking me!

257
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,760
You told me about your friend.

258
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,860
You said that his name is Tenma, right?

259
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:16,060
Would you believe that I know a man whose name is tenma also for real is your tenma really brave - yes

260
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:21,940
But he must never fire a gun not if I can do it for him. I don't want him to kill anyone

261
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,040
He's a good man

262
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,720
Killing people he's always wrong. You understand even if they're the bad guys, right?

263
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,280
Don't ever do what I'm about to do

264

No!

278
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,140
Not the rug!

279
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,080

"Get out! Go! I'll take care of things here!"

Please, Tenma, you have to leave now!

My main course. It got cold.

289
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,440
Thank you for all your cooperation, young lady.

290
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,080
We'd appreciate it if you'd come down to the station.

291
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,840
Wait one second, okay? I'll be right back.

292
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,080
Hey, hold on!

293
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,860
Tenma!

294
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,360
Nina!

295
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,580
You have to promise me something, Nina!

296
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,100
Swear to me you won't kill anyone!

297
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,460
I saw it!

298
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,800
I saw it, too! I'm heading there now!

299
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,440
Ten years ago, the night I shot my brother,

300
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,460
I'd finally know what he meant

301
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,260
when he told me to shoot him in the head!

302
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,660
Now I understand!

303
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
Johan, he's... he's not alone!

304
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,520
There are two of him inside!

305
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,260
That's why, Dr. Tenma, it wasn't your fault.

306
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,440
You didn't do anything wrong.

307
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,720
I must do it. I have no other choice.

308
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
I have to shoot Nohan... again.

309
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:42,920
Hey, wait up. What the hell are we doing here? Anyway, come on. Let's get out of here. I give up

310
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,140
There's no use with this guy. I guess I'll be starving and broke forever

311
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,300
If only I still had that rug damn it

00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,760
Yeah, the hell's that supposed to be
