1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,280
She has a baby back there, and the Neo-Nazis are planning to burn the town!

2
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,520
A Turkish woman was found dead up on the third floor.

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,520
We're approaching the meeting place where Johan will be expecting you

4
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,680
I'm not sure what'll happen there

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,040
You do know how to use that gun, right?

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Calvin Street, Frankfurt, now

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,960
Our plans have changed

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,720
Why the sudden change of heart?

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,180
What about killing Johan?

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,760
I'll deal with him later, now do as I say

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,520
General Wolf will be disappointed to hear this news

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
He personally requested that you kill Johan

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
He believed you were the man for the job.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
I don't care. I don't take requests from anyone.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,840
I'm gonna kill Johan of my own accord. Now hurry up and get to Calvin Street.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:51,820
We'll be right back.

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:21,820
We'll be right back.

18
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:40,820
All ignition points are ready to go, sir. Awaiting your orders to proceed.

19
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:46,020
Well done. Time to celebrate our superiority with a little firepower.

20
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,300
Hyle!

21
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,900
Now.

22
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,700
What are we going to do with them?

23
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,840
These two are an insult to our race.

24
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Unfortunately, these types do exist among us.

25
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,840
One is a thief, and the brat was trying to save the Turks.

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
They're both filthy scum. Purify them.

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
It's time to teach him a lesson.

28
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,840
This place is gonna burn anyway. Leave them for the flames.

29
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,840
Oh, come on, little one. Don't cry.

30
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Your mama's coming back real soon.

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:31,740
I can't believe you're still alive

32
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,020
How'd you find me?

33
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,540
It's all thanks to Dieter

34
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,340
He told me that you lived in this building

35
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,380
Did you say Dieter?

36
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,640
So then it's true, you're that Tenma guy

37
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,340
He was talking to me about the other day

38
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,920
Where is Dieter?

39
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,240
Didn't he come by?

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,820
Uh, no

41
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,460
Then where'd he go?

42
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,160
Hey, have you seen Aishe?

43
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,180
This baby is Aishe's little boy.

44
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,720
He needs her. He misses his mom a lot.

45
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,520
It can't be.

46
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,980
No, it's not possible. I don't believe it.

47
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,880
What about this poor little child?

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,660
He's too young to be without a mother.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,520
What am I going to do? What do I do?

50
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,180
She's the last.

51
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,740
There mustn't be any more victims.

52
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,460
I need to see the leaders of the Turkish quarter now.

53
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,960
So what does everyone think?

54
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,940
Set the town on fire, huh? Not likely.

55
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,520
We hear rumors about the right-wing extremists all the time.

56
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,280
We can't overreact every time they threaten us.

57
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,500
What's even more suspicious to me is this Japanese guy waltzing in here,

58
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,200
even though he says his life is in danger.

59
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,200
What's the matter with all of you?

60
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,960
Ayşe is dead. Don't you get it?

61
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,800
She was killed because she tried to warn all of us about this danger.

62
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,120
I wonder about that.

63
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,180
She was a prostitute like you, right?

64
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,800
You women go off with Germans all the time and end up missing.

65
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,100
That's nothing new.

66
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,500
You make all us Turks look bad.

67
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,140
How do we really know whose kid that is anyway?

68
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,460
You all know how hard it is to make a living.

69
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,420
You should know better than to act like this.

70
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,020
If you want to live, then you've got to listen to me.

71
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,180
Forget it! Do what you want!

72
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,600
You can burn and go to hell for all I care!

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,280
Now wait just one second.

74
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,260
Are you suggesting patrol groups?

75
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,540
Maybe we should do as this Japanese man says.

76
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,900
We have nothing to lose.

77
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,900
Mr. Denny's, are you really going to listen to some Asian we don't know?

78
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,220
He might be suspicious,

79
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,320
but there are certainly plenty of trustworthy Japanese people in the world.

80
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,900
General Nogi, for example.

81
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,060
General Nogi? Who's he?

82
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,220
You mean you don't know about him?

83
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,600
General Nogi was a brave Japanese man

84
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
who saved the Turkish Navy when they were lost in the Pacific years ago.

85
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,660
Oh.

86
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,740
Go ahead and gather all our men immediately.

87
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,860
It looks so delicious.

88
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,220
Let's dig in, shall we?

89
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,220
No need to be in such a hurry, ladies. Take your time.

90
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,220
We wouldn't want to finish eating before the entertainment.

91
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,220
I planned it so by the time the main course comes around, the show will be reaching its climax.

92
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:33,220
In the meantime, let's enjoy this 76 Chateau Latour I saved especially for this night.

93
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:42,160
the first dish we will indulge in is my favorite raw flounder with caviar

94
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:55,020
and as the feast begins oh voila the first fire what a wonderful start but like i told you that's

95
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:01,660
still just an appetizer where is the main course remember what i said don't be impatient

96
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,280
If you savor your dinner, my show will be something you'll truly enjoy.

97
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,180
Tell me where the main course is.

98
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,380
If that's an appetizer, then what are you going to burn for the main course?

99
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,080
We need more fire extinguishers!

100
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,740
We need to spread out. The rest of you men, come with me!

101
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,260
It's just as I thought. The flames started upwind.

102
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,040
This whole place could go up. Three groups, save the women and children!

103
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:38,560
My goodness, what a lovely surprise and what do we owe this honor don't even try it or kiss your boss

104
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,020
Goodbye put that dangerous thing away

105
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Why don't we enjoy this meal together?

106
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,360
Unfortunately, it seems your appetizer is fizzling out

107
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Don't worry that was just the beginning

108
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
This is your favorite, right

109
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:06,200
sorry about that don't be so contrary my dear you see after all this is a great celebration

110
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:14,200

111
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:21,820

112
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:32,280

113
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:38,260

115
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,320
main course what part of town are you going to set on fire

116
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,000
Take the injured to the shelters. I'll be right there.

117
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,040
Tenma!

118
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,660
Well, have you had any luck finding Dieter?

119
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,660
Someone told me they saw a kid who looked like him near the park around noon.

120
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,040
Dieter, my God.

121
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,180
Hey!

122
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,380
Shouldn't we go after her and try and bring her back?

123
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,640
No.

124
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,180
Let's just continue with my dinner as planned.

125
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,360
That girl sure is something.

126
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,680
I suppose it must run in the family.

127
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,300
Huh?

128
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,320
The look she had in her eyes.

129
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,360
She was really going to kill me.

130
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,980
It's a good thing she didn't realize how close I was to giving her the actual location of the main course.

131
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,260
Well, shall we bring out the next dish, sir?

132
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,000
No.

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, get me some underwear first.

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Scary girl, isn't she?

135
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,320
Hang on! I'll put it out!

136
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,220
You made it. You're going to be just fine.

137
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,040
Everything's okay, all right?

138
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,560
I got no idea who you are, lady, but thanks for getting us out of there.

139
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,620
How did the two of you end up here anyway?

140
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,640
Well, I...

141
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,860
You want to know what happened, lady?

142
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,240
This brat almost got me killed.

143
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,040
Forget this. I'm getting the hell out of here.

144
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,600
If that was the smallest fire those skinheads set, I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

145
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,140
I grew up in this neighborhood. I know the place like the back of my hand.

146
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,240
If I wanted to burn down the town, this wouldn't be the spot, believe you me.

147
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,520
This town ain't out of the woods just yet.

148
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:20,180
there were three other fires upwind that were also put out we can't thank you enough for your help

149
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,340
right everyone yeah if it weren't for you this all could have been a whole lot worse

150
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,400
our next step is to take care of the injured no i won't have any more victims not one more

151
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:38,080
wait what are you talking about well the wind's gonna change direction it always happens every

152
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,160
night around this time the wind just stops and it starts blowing towards town

153
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,220
from where the river is

154
00:11:49,700 --> 00:12:02,340
the wind it stopped and now time for the main course to be served

155
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,500
Okay. That should take care of it.

156
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,840
Thanks for patching me up, Doctor. Let me buy you a drink.

157
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,120
What are you talking about? You have to take it easy for a while.

158
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,180
Oh, come on. Loosen up, Doctor. Right?

159
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,960
That's right. It's thanks to you we were able to put out those fires and save the neighborhood.

160
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,660
I bet those neo-Nazis are scratching their heads right now wondering what the hell happened.

161
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,460
No doubt they are. That'll teach them. Never underestimate the Turks.

162
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,360
Where are they tending to all of the other injured people?

163
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,980
The mosque by the river.

164
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,380
Hey, Dr. Tenma, take a break and relax.

165
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,280
Come on, why don't you have a drink with us?

166
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,640
Not until everyone's taken care of.

167
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,900
If all of the fires up until now were just diversions,

168
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,240
where do you think they're going to light the real fire?

169
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,780
How the hell would I know?

170
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,940
Who cares about this stupid town anyway?

171
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,340
Besides, there's something much more important on my mind

172
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,720
that I gotta take care of.

173
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,040
Wait, I need you to tell me, and I need you to tell me now.

174
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:12,880
Where would you start the real fire get your hands off of me like I already told you the winds gonna come from the river

175
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,140
The abandoned factory down there would be a perfect place for a fire

176
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,100
If I'm not mistaken, there should still be a bunch of chemicals in the warehouse

177
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,700
At long last something I can sink my teeth into

178
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,180
Yes, this is going to be delicious

179
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,780
We're right on schedule.

180
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,480
The celebration of the Master Race is about to begin.

181
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,060
It's you.

182
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,060
Why did you follow me?

183
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,860
Because I have to put out the fire. I made a promise to Tenma.

184
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,100
Tenma?

185
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,040
This is it. It's the warehouse.

186
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,860
Thank goodness. Looks like they haven't found this place yet.

187
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,700
These are all filled with chemicals?

188
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,420
If all of this were to go up, it'd be hopeless. There'd be nothing left of the town.

189
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,000
I'll protect this place no matter what. I'm not going to let those horrible people burn it down.

190
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,480
Are you okay?

191
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,160
I slipped. What the heck is this?

192
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,000
It smells like gasoline.

193
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:06,780
it looks like someone's there it's all right i'm fine i can walk on my own let's get you to

194
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,960
a shelter so i can have a closer look at it i twisted my ankle it probably happened when i

195
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:20,200
was trying to get away from the fire now that i finally got this rug who gives a damn about this

196
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,280
stinking town. I bet I can

197
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
probably get 800,000 marks for this

198
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,580
baby. No, a million!

199
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,360
Heckle!

200
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,480
What happened to Dieter?

201
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,980
Couldn't say. He's probably...

202
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,120
Where is he? Where'd he go? What happened to him?

203
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,220
Last I saw, he was

204
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,260
going to the abandoned warehouse by the river.

205
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,560
Why there?

206
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,320
The wind's gonna blow in from the river soon.

207
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,500
So if the chemicals in that warehouse

208
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:58,220
or set on fire it's all over for this town this is what I was talking about

209
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,740
tell everyone to evacuate from the riverside shelters right away go you're

210
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,740
going to take me there

211
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,120
who is it who's back there

212
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:32,860
Freeze! Don't move!

213
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,780
Can it be true? Are you really Johan's sister?

214
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,360
Put the lighter down now!

215
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,920
Once I set this trail of gasoline on fire, this warehouse is going to go up in an instant.

216
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,620
I'm going to shoot you in the head before that happens.

217
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,320
I can fire quicker than you can flick that lighter, and I'm not afraid to do it!

218
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,760
And what if you miss?

219
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,780
I haven't skipped a day of training in six months straight.

220
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,080
So I know I can hit you from here.

221
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,480
You don't frighten me.

222
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,020
Don't you know this is a celebration of the Master Race?

223
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,220
This is our big welcome for Johan.

224
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,280
But Johan doesn't want any of the things you want!

225
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,660
Yes, it's true that he was recently seen here in Frankfurt.

226
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,640
But the only reason he came was to kill one of your leaders and all of his subordinates.

227
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,960
He left a message behind, you know.

228
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,800
What message?

229
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,400
Listen to me. Johan is not the person you think he is.

230
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,000
The truth is much more complex than that.

231
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,480
What are you trying to say?

232
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,740
It's worse. It must be terrifying for him.

233
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,740
He's suffering. He's in anguish and teetering on the edge of despair.

234
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:46,600
you know i'm not so sure it's such a good idea to be making enemies of these guys

235
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,520
which way to the warehouse i didn't sign on for all of this

236
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,600
i'm gonna call it a day see ya where the hell do you think you're going are you just going to let

237
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,880
dieter die like that tell me where the warehouse is all right i'll tell you i'll tell you just let

238
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,880
me go you're choking me you told me about your friend you said that his name is tenma right

239
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,000
Would you believe that I know a man whose name is Tenma also?

240
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,080
For real? Is your Tenma really brave too?

241
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,920
Yes, but he must never fire a gun, not if I can do it for him

242
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,960
I don't want him to kill anyone, he's a good man

243
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,860
Killing people is always wrong, you understand?

244
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,060
Even if they're the bad guys?

245
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,440
Right, don't ever do what I'm about to do

246
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,280
Close your eyes, don't look!

247
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Don't shoot!

248
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Tenma!

249
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Quick, Hekko! Put out the fire!

250
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Use the rock! Hurry!

251
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
No! No!

252
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
NOT THE ROCK! NOT THE ROCK!

253
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
One million marks...

254
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Gone...

255
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,260
Nina...

256
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,260
Tenma...

257
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,260
Damn it all, the cops are coming!

258
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,600
Get out! Go! I'll take care of things here. There's a boat over by the river.

259
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,900
Please, Tenma, you have to leave now!

260
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,400
My main course. It got cold.

261
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,420
Thank you for all your cooperation, young lady.

262
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,080
We'd appreciate it if you'd come down to the station.

263
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
Wait one second, okay? I'll be right back.

264
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,240
Hey, hold on!

265
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,920
Tenma!

266
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,360
Nina!

267
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,560
You have to promise me something, Nina!

268
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,000
Swear to me you won't kill anyone!

269
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,340
I saw it! I saw Johan's message!

270
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,800
I saw it, too! I'm heading there now!

271
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,440
Ten years ago, the night I shot my brother,

272
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,240
I finally know what he meant when he told me to shoot him in the head!

273
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,680
Now I understand!

274
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,240
Johan, he's... he's not alone!

275
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,540
There are two of him inside!

276
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:11,260
That's why, Dr. Tenma, it wasn't your fault.

277
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,440
You didn't do anything wrong.

278
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,400
I must do it.

279
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,720
I have no other choice.

280
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,620
I have to shoot Johan again.

281
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:41,680
hey wait up what the hell are we doing here anyway come on let's get out of here

282
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,100
i give up there's no use with this guy i guess i'll be starving and broke forever

283
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,100
if only i still had that rug damn it

284
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:58,540
huh the hell's that supposed to be

285
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:22,780
"It's...a message...help...the monster inside me...is about to explode...what is this supposed

286
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,780
to mean?

287
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,620
He has a split personality?"
