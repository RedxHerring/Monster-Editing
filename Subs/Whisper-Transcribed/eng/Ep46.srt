1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,380
This news story about the police just keeps getting worse and worse.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,040
Any new info coming in?

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,680
Yeah, that was the police calling to say they're holding a press conference about the case at 3 p.m.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,820
Then let's get rolling to the Prague Police Station.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,220
In all my years, I've never seen a case as crazy as this.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,460
Now don't tell me you've been here looking through those documents since I left you last night.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,440
Yes, but it looks like I've found that article I was looking for.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,460
Thanks for all your help.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,460
Hey, you're welcome.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,320
Glad it worked out.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,500
Oh, one second.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,360
I've got a question.

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,100
Can it wait?

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,500
I'm kind of in a rush right now.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,300
I know.

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,080
In this article I found, there's this Mr. X.

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,740
Mr. X, huh?

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,600
That's right.

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
Three years ago, your paper ran an exposÃ© entitled

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,680
"The Truth About the Former Czechoslovakian Secret Police."

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,200
Oh, yeah.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,420
That article explained how after the wall fell, that instead of pulling back,

23
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,720
the German right-wingers and the former Czechoslovakian secret police

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,220
extended their influence even more by organizing crime syndicates.

25
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,460
As a matter of fact, I'm the guy who wrote it.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,720
You wrote this article?

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,100
Well, what would it take for you to introduce me to that Czech secret police agent you interviewed,

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,860
the man you referred to as Mr. X?

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,860
You said before that you're a special correspondent here from Japan.

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,960
So enlighten me, why would you want to have an interview with our Mr. X anyway?

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,260
Well, he's newsworthy.

32
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:31,200
I'm sure the folks back home would be interested in finding out about how abductions, imprisonment, and other things were done here during the Cold War.

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,560
I gotta tell you, those guys are crazy.

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,060
I feel like I really risked my life to do that interview back then.

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,140
They're still very dangerous.

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,700
And they're still very active, based on what just went down.

37
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,540
I know you've been in here a while, but did you hear the latest update?

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,460
I mean, have you seen the headlines from this morning yet?

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,860
Well, I...

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,080
If you're trying to do a story on the secret police,

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,800
you should be following this big story

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,320
we ran about Detective Suk.

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,600
Here's a copy of today's final edition.

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,120
You can read German, can't you?

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,800
This young guy, Jan Suk, was working as a rookie detective

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,140
in the Prague Police Department.

47
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,480
After shooting two detectives

48
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,140
from a special investigative team

49
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,520
who were assigned to keep an eye on him,

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,940
Suk's run off somewhere.

51
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,060
He's flown the coop.

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
This inspector named Zemon was murdered,

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,900
and it turned out he was a corrupt cop

54
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,200
who worked for both the former Czech secret police

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,180
Sook discovers that fact and goes to the chief to report it,

56
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,460
not knowing that he has ties to the secret police as well.

57
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,780
But someone poisons the chief and his two cronies,

58
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,040
and all three of them die.

59
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,260
Sook's hailed as a hero for helping to clean up the department,

60
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,660
but then he goes and kills two cops who were assigned to watch over him.

61
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,960
Sook was a promising and skilled detective.

62
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,940
He was a young man on his way up.

63
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,180
Just what is it that you're mumbling about exactly?

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:01,640
Three superiors poisoned to death by whiskey bonbons with a muscle relaxin' in them.

65
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,240
It's Johan.

66
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,760
Excuse me. Could you please tell me if Yansuke's mother is here?

67
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,160
Well, are you with the police?

68
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,440
No.

69
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,300
She's staying in room 409.

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,320
Thank you.

71
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,960
Sir, keep your visit short. She may not want to talk.

72
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,900
(footsteps approaching)

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,100
- Pardon me, ma'am, but are you Yansuk's mother?

74
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,400
- Oh, Yan.

75
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,760
My Yan, at last you finally come.

76
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,900
- Ma'am, I'm not Yan.

77
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,860
- I'm so glad you made it here, my son.

78
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,180
Won't you come closer and let me see your face, darling?

79
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,760
You should relax now. Go ahead and lie down.

80
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,100
Oh, Yan.

81
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,920
Ma'am, have you received any phone calls or letters from your son Yan lately?

82
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,460
That Katerina, the girl next to me, is so cruel.

83
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,980
She took my toy and won't give it back to me.

84
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,280
You know, it's that precious little stuffed animal that Aunt Mary gave me.

85
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,640
I want to be sure you know something.

86
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,280
Your son is an honest cop, and he's innocent.

87
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,700
Well, I'll be going now.

88
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,860
Hold on. Tell the truth.

89
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,320
I have a hunch you've been playing there again, weren't you, Yan?

90
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,780
You always liked playing cops and robbers at that same place.

91
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,980
What place are you talking about?

92
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,400
as your own little hideout, son.

93
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,060
But I know all about it.

94
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,020
The abandoned building on Bruno Street.

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,340
- You found out about it?

96
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,880
- That's right.

97
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,960
I certainly did, Jan.

98
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,920
- Take care.

99
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,480
- Now don't go getting hurt, son.

100
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,960
Be sure to come home in time for dinner.

101
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:16,460
"Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a nameless monster. The monster was

102
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,620
dying to have a name."

103
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,940
"Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a nameless monster. The monster was

104
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,620
There lived a nameless monster.

105
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,800
I figured I'd bring you some food.

106
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,480
And the latest newspaper.

107
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,360
You're getting to be quite a celebrity, you know that?

108
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,580
Tell me.

109
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,700
Are you concerned someone will find that tape and research papers

110
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,900
from the safety deposit box that I sent to my mother?

111
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,540
Well, one thing's for certain.

112
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,760
with your mom than if we had them here with us.

113
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,460
After reading all about what happened,

114
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,120
I have to say it's amazing to me

115
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
how much your situation reminds me of that other incident.

116
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,600
It's uncanny.

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,380
- What incident?

118
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,300
- I'm referring to something that happened in Dusseldorf

119
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,420
about 10 years ago.

120
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,480
This one hospital's director and two other doctors

121
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,520
died after ingesting poisoned candy.

122
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,500
The main suspect at the time

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,160
was a promising young neurosurgeon.

124
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,140
- What ended up happening to him?

125
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,740
- Poor guy's been on the run ever since.

126
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,480
You're still in good shape, Yan. After all, you have me as a witness.

127
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,020
You mean you actually saw her as she was coming down the stairs of my apartment?

128
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,180
That I did. Our infamous blonde beauty.

129
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,720
But even if that woman really is the murderer, if we can't find her, we have nothing!

130
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,200
Calm down, Suke.

131
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,280
No! Are you saying that from now on we're stuck being on the run?

132
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,860
Why did all this happen to me?

133
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,420
What the hell did I ever do to deserve this crap?!

134
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,200
Take it easy.

135
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,080
Are you saying that from this moment on,

136
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,840
you expect me to just disappear off the face of the Earth?!

137
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,480
Cool it!

138
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,180
Come on, pull it together!

139
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,620
I've told you how to handle this, haven't I?

140
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,320
Remember when I told you the only one you can believe in is yourself?

141
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,480
Good. That's much better.

142
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,180
Now, let's eat.

143
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,080
You know,

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,860
to come here and play cops and robbers in this very room.

145
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,060
That desk?

146
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,920
It was the police inspector's desk.

147
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,720
It's hard to believe that it's still here, just as it was.

148
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,880
I would sit behind this desk and give out orders to everyone,

149
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,420
just like on TV.

150
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,040
Gentlemen, this case is a real tough one,

151
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,420
but all of us must do our very best.

152
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,300
In the name of justice, we must prevail today.

153
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,860
Evil run rampant.

154
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,560
Feels like old times.

155
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,840
No!

156
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,760
Sook!

157
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,320
Stay still.

158
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,880
We're surrounded.

159
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,700
Don't worry, Suke. I got you.

160
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,960
Let's get you away from the window and behind this desk.

161
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,080
I can't even stand!

162
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,980
That's fine. You're probably in shock.

163
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,140
The question is, who shot at us?

164
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,580
Where are they shooting at us from?

165
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,420
That shot didn't hit any vital organs. You're gonna be fine.

166
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,260
I need to borrow your gun.

167
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,600
(coughing)

168
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,320
- The tape.

169
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,580
(guns firing)

170
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,340
(knocking)

171
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,780
- Raw soup!

172
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,500
- Oh my god.

173
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,520
Hold on, I'm coming to get you!

174
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,240
(screaming)

175
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,500
The sniper's missing his heart and head on purpose.

176
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,100

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,260

273
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,820
at 511 Kinderheim.

274
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,640

275
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,160
Alright. I've treated him as best I can.

276
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,440
Thank you, Doctor. So, do you think he'll pull through?

277
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:53,480
All of the bullets that hit him passed through cleanly, but the wound that runs from the auxiliary artery to the brachial artery is pretty serious.

278
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,580
That sling I tied on him should keep enough pressure on it to stop the bleeding.

279
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,440
That's all I can do for now, but he's in shock.

280

281

00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,120

- Not bad, we need to move 'em, but... - But what? Well, what's wrong?

291
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,700
These guys have already received first aid. And proper first aid, at that.

292
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,600

293
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,420
Grimmer, look. It made the news.

294
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,680
Oh, yeah? What are they saying?

295
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,720
They're speaking Czech, so I can't follow it.

296
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,400
But I found out the name of the hospital where they're being kept.

297
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,400
It's "Yakuba Zimi Memorial."

298
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,340
Once they ID Suke, the police are probably going to arrest him.

299
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,420
It's a sad state of affairs.

300
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,940
Suke's innocent, huh?

301
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,920
He is.

302
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,280
I wonder if I should go and testify.

303
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,480
So then, Dr. Tenma, how on earth did you know we--

304
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,360
Can we talk about what you were saying earlier?

305
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,040
Please.

306
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,060
There's something I need to know more about, Grimmer.

307
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,260
Actually, I don't really remember being there.

308
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
I don't remember that period.

309
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,740

The smell of my moldy bed.

314
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,820
The memories came back to me at least a little bit, after I was finally freed from that orphanage.

315
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,640
I can almost hear someone saying I was fourteen years old.

316
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,880
Now that I think back to then, when I was first enrolled in that strange school, they

317
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,520
went and gave me a brand new name.

318
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,100
It's only then that I became Wolfgang Grimmer.

319
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,880
The place where they chose to raise me was this totally artificial neighborhood.

320
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,140
That little bubble was our whole world, and we weren't allowed out.

321
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,840
There was some man playing the father figure, and a woman to play the mother, too.

322
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,880
They taught me languages there. Russian, English, Spanish, French.

323
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,500
I could speak, read, or write 'em all.

324
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,900
You were trained to be a spy?

325
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,860
I must admit, the schooling they gave me did serve me pretty well.

326
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,280
The toughest thing to master...

327
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,140
...was just learning how to smile.

328
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,960
Now then, we have to go to the hospital where they're keeping Suk.

329
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,980
Mr. Grimmer, they had your picture in the paper.

330
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,980
They want you as a witness in this case, you know that.

331
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,860
I know, but I'm the only one who can prove Suk's innocence.
