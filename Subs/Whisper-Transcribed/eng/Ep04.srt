I know you're able to speak.

10
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,660
You have been identified at the scene of the crime of four murderers involving middle-aged couples in the past two years.

11
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,900
There's no point denying it.

12
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,340
What do you say?

13
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,140
Well, speak up, Mr. Junkers.

14
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,780
Hmm.

15
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,680
All right, okay. I guess we had better tell you that we already know that you are just a lockpick.

16
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,080
Your job is strictly undoing locks.

17
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,020
you couldn't have possibly slit their throats in one single slash with such cold-blooded grace

18
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:11,520
junkers no that wasn't your work now that means there had to be other accomplices involved

19
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,480
and i'm thinking there would have had to have been at least three of you in order to do both

20
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:24,060
open a strong lock and murder a middle-aged couple without resistance that sound about right

21
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,180
We're almost through compiling a list of suspects who we already know are skillful with knives.

22
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,320
It's only a matter of time before we're able to narrow it down to one name.

23
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,660
Whether you decide to cooperate with us or not.

24
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,220
However, I must confess that's not really what I wanted to ask you about.

25
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,260
What I would really like to know, Mr. Junkers, is why four couples from across Germany

26
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,400
and every one of the couples middle-aged and without children,

27
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Money and items were stolen, but we know the amounts were too small to justify murdering for a mere third of it.

28
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Alright, so tell me, are you up for some negotiation?

29
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
If you confess now, we'll dismiss all charges against you.

30
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
So tell me, who was the person who hired you to do this?

31
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,020
Mr. Yunkers, it's all right. It's all right.

32
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,220
That's it. This interrogation is over right now.

33
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,540
I don't think so. We're almost there.

34
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,100
Get out of here! As a doctor, I'm ordering you!

35
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,660
Very well, but I'll be coming back at a later time.

36
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,340
And just to make sure he isn't poisoned or that he doesn't disappear,

37
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,960
I will assign a guard to watch him closely.

38
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,740
That shouldn't strike you as odd.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,260
There always seems to be so much trouble happening all around you, Dr. Tenma.

40
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,360
What exactly are you trying to say?

41
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,520
Oh, nothing really.

42
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,160
Well then, we'll keep in touch.

43
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,920
Huh?

44
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Hey, hold on. Where are you going?

45
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,120
Just going out for a walk.

46
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,260
It's not supposed to leave the room without permission.

47
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,960
Patients need to get fresh air every so often.

48
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,140
We're just going out into the garden.

49
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,480
You're welcome to come with us if you like, officer.

50
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,480
Very good.

51
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,440
It's nice and warm out here today.

52
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,840
You are able to talk, aren't you?

53
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,540
It's afternoons like this one that make you happy to be alive, you know?

54
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,780
If it weren't for times like today, I don't think I'd be able to go on.

55
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,080
Especially when you're here constantly seeing people having to fight for their lives.

56
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,160
That's why it's easier for some doctors to think about their money, their research, or getting promoted.

57
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,320
I used to be one of those guys myself.

58
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,360
I wanted to get promoted and do my own research.

59
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,060
I was positive that being successful in surgery was the way to the top.

60
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,900
But after performing a surgery on a certain little boy, everything changed for me.

61
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,780
He was the older of twin siblings.

62
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,140
He'd been shot in the head.

63
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,220
Saving his life reminded me why I had become a doctor in the first place.

64
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,120
It reminded me that all human lives should be regarded as equal.

65
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,100
And that a doctor's job is to save those lives.

66
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,260
Thank you.

67
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,380
People start over all the time.

68
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,880
It's never too late, believe me.

69
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,000
Doctor.

70
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,100
You know something.

71
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,140
You and I are very close in age, but you're almost like a father to me.

72
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,500
Doctor, you saved my life and you've protected me.

73
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,660
That's why it almost feels like you're my father.

74
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,040
Well, it looks like I landed myself one big kid, huh?

75
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,140
Doctor, this one time when I was a little boy, I wanted this clock.

76
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,860
You know, I'm sure you've seen those before.

77
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,700
The kind that have a little Nutcracker figurine popping out of it every hour.

78
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:49,620
I would stare at it for a long time, pressing my face against that display window at the store every afternoon.

79
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,400
So I guess it's no surprise, Doctor, that was the first lock I ever picked in my life.

80
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,040
But I was caught in the act, and I never got that clock.

81
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,760
However, ever since that day, picking locks sort of became my job.

82
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,860
And it all started just because I wanted that stupid clock.

83
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,040
All I wanted was that stupid clock

84
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,280
I just...

85
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,160
You should just tell them everything

86
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,260
Tell the police everything you know

87
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,340
And just make a fresh start of it

88
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,520
They're dead

89
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,320
All my friends

90
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,020
They were all killed

91
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,760
Who did it?

92
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,760
Hmm is it this monster the one that you mentioned before?

93
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,520
Do me a favor don't screw it up this time. I went out of my way to set this one up for you

94
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,960
You know she's the daughter of a state legislator. She is beautiful and intelligent all in one package in other words perfection

95
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,500
well we'll see about that but you know what all kidding aside you're right it

96
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,900
is time for me to find someone of course I'm right the thing is that someone in

97
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,720
your position without a wife just seems like hey

98
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm sure you've seen those before the kind that have a little nutcracker

99
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,900
her figurine popping out of it every hour.

100
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,860
- This is it.

101
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,680
- Excuse me, about the clock in the window.

102
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,860
- Hey, what's going on?

103
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,560
You're already late for your date.

104
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,640
What are you doing?

105
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,840
- People start over all the time.

106
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,860
It's never too late, believe me.

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:19,840

Mr. Junkers!

119

It's the same as last time.

120
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,440
Pills and candy.

121
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,640
My patience disappearing.

122
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,800
Just like nine years ago.

123
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,660
Mr. Junkers!

124
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,040
Mr. Junkers!

125
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,720
It's me, Dr. Tenma.

126
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,520
Doctor!

127
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,680
Stay away, Doctor!

128
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,920
Let's go back to the hospital, Mr. Junkers.

129
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,760
Everything will be all right.

130
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,480
Don't, Doctor! Don't come any closer!

131
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,680
Doctor!

132
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:58,300
I'm begging you, please, don't look at him

133
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,580
At who?

134
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,300
He's the one who killed my friends

135
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,020
And he'll kill you, too

136
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:15,340
Who are you?

137
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,440
Oh, God, just run, run away, please

138
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,420
It's been a long time, Doctor. It's me.

139
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,540
Nine years ago, you saved my life.

140
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,300
Nine years ago?

141
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,680
Have you forgotten already, Doctor, about the twins?

142
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,180
Johan.

143
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Johan...

144
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,440
That's right. That twin. You remember.

145
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Run! Don't look at his face! He'll kill you!

146
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,440
What do you think you're doing here? Mr. Junkers is my patient. Let him go!

147
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
What am I doing?

148
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:30,120
an execution don't do it doctor run he killed my friends runway you can't just get out of here

149
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,300
we were hired by him he'd call us each time a large amount would be wired to our accounts

150
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,920
after each job that way it seemed as if we had taken the money and split it we had it all figured

151
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,220
out it can't be so the murder of those four middle-aged couples was ordered by it was you

152
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:55,940
the police started suspecting me and following me so he he wanted to get rid of us listen to me

153
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,500
the other two fritz the slayer and big boy boris have already been killed

154
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:08,080
fritz said to me just before he died that we had oh my god that we had been hired by a monster

155
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:16,000
he doesn't even blink at killing someone it means nothing to him run doctor he'll kill you where you

156
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,620
You talk too much, Junkers.

157
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,180
Johann! Don't do this!

158
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,460
Mr. Junkers doesn't know your identity, but I do!

159
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,440
I was your attending physician!

160
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,880
You are Johann Liebert, the elder of fraternal twins.

161
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,760
You are the son of Michael Liebert, former advisor of commerce,

162
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,540
who fled East Germany in 1986 as a political refugee to the West.

163
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,980
If we know this much about you, you can't possibly escape.

164
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,260
Don't add to your crimes, Johan.

165
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,500
Johan, huh?

166
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,020
Yes, there was a time when I went by that name.

167
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,420
But you know something, Doctor?

168
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,500
Johan isn't my real name.

169
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,480
What are you talking about?

170
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,160
You must never know about my past.

171
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,380
Not about those four couples.

172
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,140
Nor the Lieberts.

173
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,220
But you're different, Doctor.

174
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,040
You cared for me and you restored me to life.

175
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,780
So I feel as though you're like a father to me.

176
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,520
Like a father?

177
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,820
The truth is, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be standing here right now.

178
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,680
Stop it! You can't just go around killing!

179
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,680
Why not?

180
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,880
Why not?

181
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,320
Because a human life is precious, don't you see that?

182
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,220
Rescuing you opened my eyes.

183
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,340
I was able to go back to being the doctor I should have always been.

184
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,080
Saving your life made me realize that the weight of each life is equal.

185
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,800
No one's better than anyone else.

186
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,080
That's why no one has the right to take another person's life.

187
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,640
As a doctor, I lived by those beliefs for the last nine years because of you.

188
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,740
What are you laughing at?

189
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:17,880
Doctor, I heard you were promoted to chief of surgery soon after that incident

190
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:25,040
I'm really happy, doctor, that you were promoted to that position

191
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,720
What are you trying to tell me?

192
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,000
You are where you are today because the director and the others died, right?

193
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm so glad I was able to help

194
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,600
That was a good thing

195
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:49,360
did you oh my god isn't that what you wanted doctor that's what you said anyway

196
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:57,360
right after i regained consciousness that's what you told me that you hated them so much

197
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:07,440
you wished they were dead i am not wrong he is bastard bastard he'd be better off dead

198
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:15,580
all that i did was grant you your wish doctor

199
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:30,000
oh god save me doctor i don't want to die i don't want to die

200
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:59,320
I was supposed to die that night.

201
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,720
You're the one who resurrected me, Doctor.

Well, wouldn't you agree, Dr. Tenma?

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,700
All right

210

To summarize what you've told me so far

211
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,280
Just to make sure that we piece it all together

212
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Back in 1986, Liebert, a high government official, escaped from East Germany with his wife and two children.

213
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Right after they arrived, the Liebert family was attacked, the couple was killed, and the twin brothers suffered a critical gunshot wound to the head.

214
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,280
You were the surgeon in charge of his operation, and subsequently saved the boy's life.

215
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:35,400
life but to everyone's surprise as fate would have it the boy kills the director

216
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,660
the chief of surgery and the head of neurosurgery with poison candy and then

217
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,600
disappears and last night after nine long years out of the clear blue the

218
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,440
Liebert boy reappears and kills a state police officer with poison candy yet

219
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,100
again and right in front of your eyes he shoots Adolf Junkers your patient he is

220
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,760
is none other than the very man that hired Junkers

221
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,440
and two others to murder the four middle-aged couples

222
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,040
across Germany.

223
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,460
And his name is Johann Liebert.

224
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,740
I believe that's the entire story, isn't it?

225
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,520
Yes, sir.

226
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,320
I think we're finished with the doctor.

227
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,980
He can go.

228
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:31,260
I don't think that someone with Dr. Tenma's credentials or in his position could be responsible for such a crime.

229
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:37,960
He has an alibi for the time the policeman was killed, and we didn't find any gunpowder residue on his hands.

230
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:44,560
So much for key evidence. There go all of our leads to solving those murders of the four middle-aged couples.

231
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,600
Inspector Lunge, should we get started on this Johann Liebert for the time being?
