How about it? Can you talk to me today?

What's that?

17
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,260
Junkers. I know you're able to speak. You have been identified at the scene of the

18
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,380
crime of four murderers involving middle-aged couples in the past two

19
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:45,240
years. There's no point denying it. What do you say? Well, speak up, Mr. Junkers.

20
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,740
Hmm. All right, okay. I guess we'd better tell you that we already know that you

21
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,180
is strictly undoing locks.

22
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,720
You couldn't have possibly slit their throats in one single slash with such cold-blooded

24
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,680
No, that wasn't your work.

25
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,600
No, that means there had to be other accomplices involved.

26
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,080
And I'm thinking there would have had to have been at least three of you in order to do

27
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,200
both, open a strong lock, and murder a middle-aged couple without resistance.

28
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,140
That sound about right?

29
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,100
We're almost through compiling a list of suspects

30
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,200
who we already know are skillful with knives.

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,540
It's only a matter of time before we're able

32
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,420
to narrow it down to one name,

33
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,780
whether you decide to cooperate with us or not.

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,700
However, I must confess that's not really

35
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,300
what I wanted to ask you about.

36
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,100
What I would really like to know, Mr. Junkers,

37
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,360
is why four couples from across Germany

38
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,460
and every one of the couples middle-aged

39
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,500
and without children,

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,860
but we know the amounts were too small to justify murdering for a mere third of it.

41
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,720
All right. So tell me, are you up for some negotiation?

42
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,660
If you confess now, we'll dismiss all charges against you.

43
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,160
So tell me, who was the person who hired you to do this?

44
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,280
Mr. Junkers, it's alright! It's alright! That's it! This interrogation is over right now!

45
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,660
I don't think so. We're almost there.

46
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,200
Get out of here! As a doctor, I'm ordering you!

47
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,760
Very well, but I'll be coming back at a later time.

48
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,060
And just to make sure he isn't poisoned or that he doesn't disappear, I will assign a guard to watch him closely.

49
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,880
That shouldn't strike you as odd.

50
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,400
There always seems to be so much trouble happening all around you, Dr. Tenma.

51
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,480
What exactly are you trying to say?

52
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,640
Oh, nothing really.

53
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,300
Well then, we'll keep in touch.

54
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,020
Hey, hold on! Where are you going?

55
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,240

We're just going out into the garden.

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
You're welcome to come with us if you like, officer.

60
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,560
It's nice and warm out here today.

61
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,980
You are able to talk, aren't you?

62
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,660
It's afternoons like this one that make you happy to be alive, you know?

63
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,880
If it weren't for times like today, I don't think I'd be able to go on.

64
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,200
Especially when you're here constantly seeing people having to fight for their lives.

65
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,260
That's why it's easier for some doctors to think about their money, their research, or getting promoted.

66
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,460
I used to be one of those guys myself.

67
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,480
I wanted to get promoted and do my own research.

68
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,160
I was positive that being successful in surgery was the way to the top.

69
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,000
But after performing a surgery on a certain little boy, everything changed for me.

70
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,860
He was the older of twin siblings.

71
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
He'd been shot in the head.

72
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,340
Saving his life reminded me why I had become a doctor in the first place.

73
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:49,220
It reminded me that all human lives should be regarded as equal and that a doctor's job is to save those lives.

74
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,380
Thank you.

75
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,980
People start over all the time. It's never too late, believe me.

76
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,220
Doctor, you know something?

77
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,280
You and I are very close in age, but you're almost like a father to me.

78
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,620
Doctor, you saved my life and you've protected me.

79
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,780
That's why it almost feels like you're my father.

80
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,140
Well, it looks like I landed myself one big kid, huh?

81
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,240
Doctor, this one time when I was a little boy, I wanted this clock.

82
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,000
You know, I'm sure you've seen those before.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,840
the kind that have a little Nutcracker figurine popping out of it every hour.

84
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,900
I would stare at it for a long time,

85
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,700
pressing my face against that display window at the store every afternoon.

86
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,500
So I guess it's no surprise, Doctor, that was the first lock I ever picked in my life.

87
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,180
But I was caught in the act, and I never got that clock.

88
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,860
However, ever since that day, picking locks sort of became my job.

89
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,980
and it all started just because I wanted that stupid clock.

90
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,160
All I wanted was that stupid clock.

91
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,780
I just...

92
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,200
- You should just tell them everything.

93
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,360
Tell the police everything you know

94
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,400
and just make a fresh start of it.

95
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,620
- They're dead.

96
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,060
Oh, my friends, they were all killed.

97
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,800
Who did it?

98
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,180
Is it this monster, the one that you mentioned before?

99
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,020
Do me a favor, don't screw it up this time.

100
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,660
I went out of my way to set this one up for you.

101
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,560
You know, she's the daughter of a state legislator.

102
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,000
She is beautiful and intelligent all in one package in other words perfection

103
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,700
Well, we'll see about that

104
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,200
But you know what all kidding aside you're right. It is time for me to find someone

105
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,980
Of course i'm right. The thing is that someone in your position without a wife just seems like uh, hey

106
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,960
I'm sure you've seen those before, the kind that have a little nutcracker figurine popping

107
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,980
out of it every hour.

108
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,760
This is it.

109
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,080
Excuse me.

110
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,500
About the clock in the window.

111
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,660
Hey, what's going on?

112
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,240

I'm ready to confess, but I'd prefer if Dr. Tenma were present.

Where'd he could have gone?

Hey, officer, I wanted to...

Listen, I know it's late, but can I go see one of my patients?

Yes, but of course, Dr. Tenma. What is it you have there?

Hey, what's the matter? Are you alright?

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,100

We were hired by him.

172
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,260
He'd call us each time.

173
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,440

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,520
and split it.

177
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,500
He had it all figured out!

178
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,560
- It can't be.

179
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,220
So the murder of those four middle-aged couples

180
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,320
was ordered by, it was you.

181
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,160
The police started suspecting me and following me, so he... he wanted to get rid of us!

182
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,520
Listen to me! The other two, Fritz the Slayer and Big Boy Boris, have already been killed!

183
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,680
Fritz said to me just before he died that we had...

184
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,160
Oh my God, that we had been hired by a monster!

185
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,840
He doesn't even blink at killing someone. It means nothing to him.

186
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,360
Run, Doctor! He'll kill you where you stand, just run!

187
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,760
You talk too much, Junkers.

188
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,320
Johann! Don't do this!

189
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,600
Mr. Junkers doesn't know your identity, but I do!

190
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,580
I was your attending physician!

191
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,040
You are Johann Liebert, the elder of fraternal twins.

192
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,900
You are the son of Michael Liebert, former advisor of commerce,

193
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,680
who fled East Germany in 1986 as a political refugee to the West.

194
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,120
If we know this much about you, you can't possibly escape.

195
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,400
Don't add to your crimes, Johan.

196
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,620
Johan, huh?

197
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,140
Yes, there was a time when I went by that name.

198
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,560
But you know something, Doctor?

199
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,640
Johan isn't my real name.

200
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,620
Wh-what are you talking about?

201
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,280
You must never know about my past.

202
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,520
Not about those four couples.

203
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,280
Nor the Lieberts.

204
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,360
But you're different, Doctor.

205
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,160
You cared for me and you restored me to life.

206
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,920
So I feel as though you're like a father to me.

207
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,700
Like a... a father?

208
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,980
The truth is, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be standing here right now.

209
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,800
Stop it! You can't just go around killing!

210
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,800
Why not?

211
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,820
Why not? Because...

212
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,440
A human life is precious, don't you see that?

213
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,460
Rescuing you opened my eyes. I was able to go back to being the doctor I should have always been!

214
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,920
Saving your life made me realize that the weight of each life is equal! No one's better than anyone else!

215
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,200
That's why no one has the right to take another person's life!

216
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,700
As a doctor, I lived by those beliefs for the last nine years because of you!

217
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,760
What are you laughing at?!

218
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,020
Doctor, I heard you were promoted to Chief of Surgery soon after that incident.

219
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,020
Huh?

220
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,140
I'm really happy, Doctor, that you were promoted to that position.

221
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,820
What are you trying to tell me?

222
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,160
You are where you are today because the Director and the others died, right?

223
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,660
I'm so glad I was able to help. That was a good thing.

224
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,200
Did you? Oh my god!

225
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:54,100
Isn't that what you wanted, Doctor? That's what you said anyway. Right after I regained consciousness, that's what you told me.

226
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,360
That you hated them so much, you wished they were dead.

227
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,080
I am not wrong, he is!

228
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,060
Bastard! Bastard!

229
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,540
He'd be better off dead!

230
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,060
All that I did was grant you your wish, Doctor.

231
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,740
Oh, God! I'm afraid! Oh, God!

232
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,280
Save me, Doctor! I don't wanna die!

233
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,140
I don't want to die!

234
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,380
I can't!

235
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,360
I was supposed to die that night you're the one who resurrected me

236
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:02,820
Hey, Doctor.

237
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,760
What a miserable downpour.

238
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,580
I despise the wet weather.

239
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,820
All it does is wash away the crime scene evidence when you need it the most.

240
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,160
Well wouldn't you agree, Dr. Tenma?

241
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,820
All right. To summarize what you've told me so far, just to make sure that we piece it

242
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:14,280
all together. Back in 1986, Liebert, a high government official, escaped from East Germany

243
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,060
with his wife and two children. Right after they arrived, the Liebert family was attacked,

244
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,560
the couple was killed, and the twin brothers suffered a critical gunshot wound to the head.

245
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,420
in charge of his operation,

246
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,040
and subsequently save the boy's life.

247
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,800
But to everyone's surprise, as fate would have it,

248
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,780
the boy kills the director, the chief of surgery,

249
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,300
and the head of neurosurgery with poison candy,

250
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,460
and then disappears.

251
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,460
And last night, after nine long years,

252
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,200
out of the clear blue, the Liebert boy reappears

253
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,000
and kills a state police officer

254
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,120
with poison candy yet again.

255
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,800
And right in front of your eyes,

256
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,140
he shoots Adolf Junkers, your patient.

257
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,780
He is none other than the very man that hired Junkers

258
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,440
and two others to murder the four middle-aged couples

259
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,400
across Germany.

260
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,010
And his name is Johann Liebert.

261
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,800
I believe that's the entire story, isn't it?

262
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,360
(clears throat)

263
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,320
- Yes, sir.

264
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,140
- I think we're finished with the doctor.

265
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,020
He can go.

266
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:31,420
I don't think that someone with Dr. Tenma's credentials, or in his position, could be responsible for such a crime.

267
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,100
He has an alibi for the time the policeman was killed, and we didn't find any gunpowder residue on his hands.

268
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,680
So much for key evidence. There go all of our leads to solving those murders of the four middle-aged couples.

269
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,740
Inspector Lunge, should we get started on this Johann Liebert for the time being?
