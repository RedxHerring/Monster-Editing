1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Excuse me, officer. Just a couple of questions, please.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,240
Stay there! Stay right there! Hold it!

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,100
Back off! You're interfering with a crime scene!

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,840
Can you please tell us what the police are thinking?

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,360
What are your views on this situation?

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,880
Do you believe the case is linked to the serial murders?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,340
Mr. and Mrs. Yopei were quite wealthy and have no children, right?

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,160
No matter how you look at it, it's obvious this incident is exactly like

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,840
the other cases of murdered middle-aged couples across Germany.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,800
No comment at this time.

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,720
I've heard that the BKA is sending an agent to look into this. Is that true?

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:38,700
Does that mean there's a connection to the serial murders? No comment. Oh, man. I

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,560
Think I'd have better luck talking to a BKA suit directly than trying to get this guy to give me anything

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,400
Just trust me. All right, I promise you will be the first ones with the story

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,080
Just make sure you leave plenty of space on the front page

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,840
Hmm

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,160
Just do it. I gotta go

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Excuse me, sir.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,260
My name is Kipper.

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,620
I'm with the Hamburg TOG.

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,820
You've been sent here by the BKA to investigate this murder.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,940
Correct me if I'm wrong, I was wondering, is this case somehow connected to the other

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,600
serial murders?

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,540
Well, Kipper of the Hamburg TOG, you're right on both counts.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,380
Get your pen ready, because here's my statement.

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,660
A middle-aged couple was murdered and it appears to be another serial slaying.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,780
I knew it! And it's the suspect, that Japanese doctor?

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,780
Yes, I just saw the report. It's his M.O. The murders were carried out the same way.

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,100
Thank you for the scoop.

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,660
Gotta run.

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,840
Oh, one more thing.

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,060
Huh?

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,240
I'm aware the Hamburg TOG is a leading local newspaper.

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,560
But I expect you to make sure your story gets published in every major newspaper in the country as well.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,940
Hey, consider it done. Thanks again for all your help, friend.

36
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,340
[MUSIC]

37
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,300
(dramatic music)

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,100
(birds chirping)

39
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,460
(knocking)

40
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,180
I have become the killer.

41
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,120
I think to myself as I approach,

42
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,620
what's the best way to get into their house?

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,400
Should I knock?

44
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,900
I don't want to startle the yope-pays

45
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,100
by walking in on them.

46
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,400
(knocking)

47
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,460
Such a friendly couple.

48
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,960
They greet me and show me to the living room.

49
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,220
These folks aren't the least bit suspicious

50
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,480
they lead me in.

51
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,160
The husband's chair.

52
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,880
Naturally, I sit on the sofa, facing him.

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,760
A few minutes later, the husband will die on the floor,

54
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,840
over there.

55
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,300
But I haven't made that move yet,

56
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,200
so I have to decide when to eliminate him.

57
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,100
I'll do it when the wife leaves the room.

58
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,800
To the kitchen, to make us some tea.

59
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,540
She is stabbed in the back before she even has a chance to serve it.

60
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,260
Obviously then, I need to make my move on the husband while she's occupied in the kitchen.

61
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,200
I reach in, pull out the knife.

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,200
The husband sees this, panics, tries to stand up.

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,680
I stab him, but I miss and end up slashing him.

64
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,400
The husband runs off with blood dripping from his wounded left hand.

65
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,540
So I try to get him again. I swing the knife.

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,000
I only puncture his right shoulder.

67
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,460
I'm such a clumsy amateur.

68
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,400
Desperately, the husband yells his wife's name,

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,020
only she can't hear him from out in the kitchen.

70
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,980
Recently, she's developed a hearing problem.

71
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,260
Yes, turns out I knew about that, didn't I?

72
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,240
Go on, shout all you want.

73
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,860
I can take my time to kill you and then your wife.

74
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,120
You're trapped.

75
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,180
There's your left handprint on the wall.

76
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,780
You can't get away from me.

77
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,880
I've got you pinned against this table.

78
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,800
You're finished.

79
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,800
But then, something prevents me from completing the task.

80
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,000
It's five meters from this point to where the husband dies.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,200
How come? Why not just eliminate him here and be done with it?

82
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,140
Why wait?

83
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,020
I've never seen him.

84
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,260
Do you suspect he's the one who broke in and murdered my neighbors?

85
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,700
and I can only say he's a person of interest,

86
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,620
but I'm asking everybody in the neighborhood

87
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,420
for their cooperation in this matter.

88
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,700
If you see this man, just act normal.

89
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,260
I don't want him to become suspicious.

90
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,240
Then get in touch with me as soon as you possibly can.

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,320
That would be all I need for you to do.

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,940
I personally assure you, you won't be in any danger.

93
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,860
Hard to imagine such a tragic event like this happening here.

94
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,860
It's such a pleasant, quiet neighborhood.

95
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,620
It really is.

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,580
just the best.

97
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,180
When I'd call out to her from my doorstep,

98
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,760
Mrs. Youpei would always greet me cheerfully.

99
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,360
That's very interesting.

100
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,520
I've been told Mrs. Youpei lost her hearing about a year ago

101
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,880
and refused a hearing aid.

102
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:43,940
Huh?

103
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,780
Are you sure?

104
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
It was in her medical record.

105
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,980
If I had to guess, she really couldn't

106
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,360
hear any of your greetings.

107
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,620
Oh.

108
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,440
Well, knowing the type of person she was,

109
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,480
she probably sensed my presence and wanted

110
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,520
to make me feel good.

111
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,320
So then, in your opinion, nobody else in the neighborhood knew about her hearing loss either?

112
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,400
No, I wouldn't think so.

113
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,920
It certainly appears that your business is booming.

114
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,600
You made rapid progress at an early age.

115
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,520
It's not easy for a young man to achieve such quick success, Mr. Jeeble.

116
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,020
You're right. The contracts I made with the car manufacturers just happened to work out.

117
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,180
Before we begin, I'd like to extend my deepest condolences for the recent loss of your aunt and uncle.

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,180
Their passing was a great loss.

119
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,440
They were the only relatives I had left in the world.

120
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,720
It appears they never had any children of their own.

121
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,140
So they must have taken good care of you since you were their only nephew.

122
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,920
Yes. They treated me as if I were their son.

123
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,620
Sir, tell me you'll be able to catch the murderer.

124
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,120
I will. I'm pretty sure I know who's behind it.

125
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,820
Me too. I bet it was that Japanese doctor, wasn't it?

126
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,800
Sounds like you're very well informed.

127
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,160
Well, of course I am.

128
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,240
As a matter of fact, I've heard he's been linked to other murders similar to this.

129
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,300
I'm curious, just how much do you stand to inherit?

130
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,860
You see, I found out that Mr. Youpei was quite a wealthy man.

131
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,040
So what?

132
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,740
His wealth has nothing to do with this serial murder case.

133
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,380
Sir, I presume you are the sole heir to their considerable estate,

134
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,000
seeing as how you are their only nephew.

135
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,780
It's inappropriate to be discussing my inheritance in these circumstances.

136
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,220
A company can appear to be booming on the surface,

137
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,300
but underneath may have serious cash flow problems that have gotten out of hand.

138
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,800
It's a common occurrence in the business world.

139
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,260
Just a minute!

140
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,500
You're implying I murdered them when there's a serial killer on the loose?

141
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,360
How dare you!

142
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,320
What are you so worried about?

143
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,680
You have a perfect alibi for the time in question.

144
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,060
And you have plenty of witnesses.

145
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,800
You bought your secretary and some others a nice dinner after a long meeting.

146
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,280
W-what exactly are you getting at?

147
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,740
That it appears that you could not be the murderer, I'm sure you agree.

148
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,920
Inspector Lungay.

149
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,460
Well, what do you want, Kipper?

150
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,840
What the hell is going on?

151
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,460
Going on with what?

152
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,740
Don't play dumb, Inspector. I've been out digging up stuff on that nephew for the last couple days.

153
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,700
His company looks profitable at first glance, but turns out to be holding a lot of bad stocks and bonds.

154
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,400
Cash-wise, it's in a whirl of hurt.

155
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,500
And now I found out you've been investigating the same company.

156
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,240
I want the truth.

157
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,680
Who killed those folks, Lungay?

158
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,300
In light of what you've uncovered,

159
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,520
do you still think this case is related to the other middle-aged murders?

160
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,960
All of the newspapers have printed a variation of my story.

161
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,080
If the cases aren't related, then it's just sensational journalism.

162
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,060
My reputation could be damaged.

163
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,720
Your instincts are correct.

164
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,460
It's the work of a copycat.

165
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,980
It was set up to look like the serial killer.

166
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,760
That's just great. I've got to publish a retraction right away.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,320
No. It's fine as it is.

168
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,680
Huh?

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,260
You'll continue writing your follow-up stories

170
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,140
as if this case were another one of the middle-aged couple murders.

171
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,480
What? It's not ethical. No way.

172
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,680
I won't do it, I tell you.

173
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,960
Oh, but you will.

174
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,460
I'm... I'm an honest journalist who believes in reporting the whole truth.

175
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,380
And you're not going to tell me what I can write.

176
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,540
Well, let me give you the truth.

177
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,440
You have good taste, really. She's quite lovely.

178
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,560
[ Gasps ]

179
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,660
You have a pleasant home,

180
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,280
with a devoted wife and a doting daughter who both adore you.

181
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,980
But it was impossible for you to resist the charms

182
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,580
of that attractive other woman, wasn't it?

183
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,740
Continue as before.

184
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,840
No. Beef it up a little.

185
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,220
Write a special report about the serial murderers.

186
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,400
If you do as I've asked, he'll most certainly come.

187
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,400
I'm counting on you.

188
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,960
Yes? Who is it?

189
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,400
Excuse me, ma'am. May I ask you some questions?

190
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,320
(dog barking)

191
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,580
Well, sounds like the Yopais were really a wonderful couple.

192
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,140
- They were.

193
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,740
- I see, and you're absolutely certain

194
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,300
they didn't have any adopted children?

195
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,220
- Oh, yes.

196
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,160
- Did any children, children that you'd never seen before,

197
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,160
live with them, even for a short time?

198
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,220
- No, never.

199
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,480
But they took very good care of their nephew.

200
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,320
He was the apple of their eye.

201
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,940
Ah, would you like more tea?

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,860
It won't take a minute.

203
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,280
- I'm fine.

204
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
Your tea won't hurt you.

205
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,900
There's no mistaking him.

206
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,840
He's the man from that photo and he's in my dining room right now.

207
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,460
Nothing to worry about.

208
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,340
Thanks for your cooperation.

209
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,900
Inspector Lungay, someone's here to see you.

210
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,440
Well, who is it?

211
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,160
He says he's the nephew of the Lopez, that couple that was killed.

212
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,180
Inspector, you believe I'm the one who murdered them. I'm your suspect, right?

213
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,980
You think I killed my aunt and uncle for their money. That's what you hinted at the other day.

214
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,100
Let's face it, we both know that I have many debts right now.

215
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,780
And the inheritance money they ended up leaving me will more than likely get me out of this whole mess.

216
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,880
However, that's not the kind of person I am.

217
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,840
Is that really all you came here to tell me?

218
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,260
All I came here to...

219
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,300
Wait a minute! How dare you speak to me in such a condescending way!

220
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,600
Well, if you'll excuse me, there's somewhere I have to be right at the moment.

221
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,140
Don't you walk away! I demand an apology for your disrespectful behavior!

222
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,860
Perhaps you weren't aware that the police had been following you.

223
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,760
Well now, that order has been cancelled.

224
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,600
Your local law enforcement thinks that you're innocent.

225
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,020
Isn't that good enough for you, Mr. Jeeble?

226
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,740
Well, do you agree with them, or am I still the prime target of your investigation?

227
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,660
You want to know if I think you're guilty?

228
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,440
That really doesn't matter to me at the moment.

229
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,100
My chief concern is to catch the man I've been after.

230
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,740
"The bloodstain over there can only mean one thing.

231
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,960
He must have missed."

232
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,800
"Then am I to assume that you're convinced the Japanese doctor is responsible for killing my aunt and uncle?"

233
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,780
"Never assume anything. I've concluded it was a copycat murder made to look like the middle-aged couple's homicides."

234
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,180
"But how can you be so certain about that?"

235
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,580
"Because there's one element this case has that makes it different from all the others."

236
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,860
The killer cornered the victim here,

237
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,480
but he doesn't finish him off.

238
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,460
He waits till his victim gets over there

239
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,240
before delivering the final blow.

240
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,460
But why?

241
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,740
Why does the murderer hesitate?

242
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,340
It's not him.

243
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,880
That element is emotion.

244
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,920
Emotion?

245
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,720
Yes, you see, the man I'm after

246
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,020
He tries to make his crimes look like robberies.

247
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,920
He murders quickly without hesitation or emotion.

248
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,200
At least, that's his goal.

249
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,980
But this crime scene is full of emotions.

250
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,720
The killer panicked when he saw his face

251
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,080
and the victim's face together in the mirror.

252
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,260
You needn't worry.

253
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,820
From what I've observed,

254
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,140
the police in this town are totally incompetent.

255
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:55,300
This crime was definitely not committed by Johan, but somebody wants the police to pin it on him.

256
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,560
How much longer is this all going to continue? When will it end?

257
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,700
Hello, it's been a while.

258
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,980
So, we finally meet again, Dr. Tenma.

259
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,460
I've been looking all over for you, for a very long time.

260
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,320
I've been hoping to have a quiet chat with you.

261
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,400
There's no use in running away anymore.

262
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,620
Stop trying to escape and talk to me.

263
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,220
The fact is, there's no place you can hide, Dr. Tenma.

264
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,400
Yes, you're all mine.

265
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,180
Why couldn't you just leave it alone?

266
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,200
I'm guilty.

267
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,820
I confess.

268
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,420
I'm the one who came in and killed him!

269
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,440
[screaming]

270
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,140
Your confession means nothing to me.

271
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,720
Just stay out of my way.

272
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,600
[panting]

273
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,240
Temp, come on!

274
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,340
[panting]

275
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,100
[panting]

276
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,180
He's been seriously wounded... I've got to do something now or he's going to bleed to

277
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:15,920
death. Who could have stabbed Inspector Lungay? I'll drop him off in front of the hospital

278
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:39,140
Damn. Where are they? I need the keys to the handcuffs. Tell me where you put them, Inspector.

279
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,840
Don't bother reaching for your gun. I took it off you while you were unconscious. Don't

280
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,100
be so stubborn. Just give me the keys. I'm a doctor, but I can't help you like this.

281
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,940
I examined your wound the best I could. It appears that only your muscles sustained the

282
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,220
damage. But you're losing an awful lot of blood. If we don't stop the bleeding, you're

283
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,220
Come on, confess. Do it, Dr. Tenma.

284
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,980
Confess to what?

285
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,260
That you murdered the director of Eisler Memorial Hospital along with three others.

286
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,680
And that you've been on a three-year killing spree targeting middle-aged couples.

287
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,400
It's time to come clean and admit what you've done.

288
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,240
If you keep this up, you'll be a dead man.

289
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,100
Come on, Doctor. Don't try to fool me.

290
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,040
You're only fooling yourself

291
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,480
by running around chasing this elusive Johan.

292
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,920
Johan doesn't exist. Admit it.

293
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,760
You made him up. You're a killer.

294
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,460
You're Johan, Dr. Tenma. Own up to it.

295
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,360
Inspector, right now, you require emergency treatment.

296
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,840
I have everything I need to do the procedure.

297
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,760
Except for my hands!

298
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,720
They're my tools and I can't save your life

299
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,780
with them chained together!

300
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,580
Yes. When you're the well-liked Dr. Tenma,

301
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,500
those are the hands of a highly skilled surgeon who has saved many lives.

302
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,020
But how many people have you killed with those hands?

303
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,520
You've got it wrong. I'm not a killer.

304
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,480
No, but you change into Johan.

305
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,380
When does the good doctor turn into the bad monster?

306
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,980
I already told you, you're mistaken.

307
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,840
Then let me tell you. I never make mistakes.

308
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,620
Blood pressure's falling. You're going to lose consciousness soon.

309
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,480
Your crime scenes are always...

310
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,240
No more talking. It'll weaken you.

311
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,280
Your crime scenes are always lacking in something.

312
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,580
An emotional factor. Save your strength.

313
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,280
Dealing with life and death every day forces doctors to check their emotions.

314
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,680
Right, Dr. Tenma?

315
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,580
You develop a cold exterior, and it's that coldness I always find at your crime scenes.

316
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,120
This cold, calm, emotionless taking of life.

317
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,920
I am not that kind of man!

318
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,580
Every time I operate, a thousand emotions go through my head.

319
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,000
They affect my every decision.

320
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,180
Is my diagnosis accurate?

321
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,400
Will there be any unforeseen complications?

322
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,360
Will my patient even survive?

323
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,620
How can I be calm when I hold a person's life in my hands?

324
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,860
In these hands.

325
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,120
How in the hell can I be calm?

326
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,540
Don't come closer. Stop.

327
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,920
I can save you.

328
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,280
I will shoot.

329
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,740
I need my hands to stop the bleeding.

330
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,920
Are the keys in your pants pocket? Tell me.

331
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,600
I will shoot.

332
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,080
You really had us worried for a while, but you're looking quite well.

333
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,240
Lots better than when you're running around investigating crimes.

334
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,860
I guess this means you're not rid of me yet.

335
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,320
Yeah, you'll be back on your feet in no time.

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,860
That emergency procedure you received before you got here was done perfectly.

337
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Your doctor said you wouldn't be alive without it.

338
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,860
I'm assuming that Tenma got his hands free and used them to save my life.

339
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,180
Yeah, well, he got away, but we got Jibal.

340
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,360
He confessed to murdering the Yopei couple.

341
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,580
He stabbed you because you were on to him.

342
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,840
You did good, Lunge.

343
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,940
Thank you.

344
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,800
Well, what do you think?

345
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,820
About what?

346
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,120
It's quite clear that Tenma saved Lunge's life,

347
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,460
so I'm worried Lunge might have a problem pursuing him now.

348
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,820
I'm wondering if I should remove him from the Tenma case.

349
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm sorry. Did he call for you again?

350
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,960
Inspector Lunge can be very demanding.

351
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,240
Oh, he really isn't that difficult at all.

352
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,320
In fact, I find him to be very pleasant.

353
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,460
I keep telling him not to rush through the recovery process,

354
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,740
but he's quite determined.

355
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,160
He's already working on strengthening his grip,

356
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,000
and he's taking long walks down the hall.

357
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,700
He seems to be having a really fun time recovering.

358
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,480
He's having fun?

359
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,780
Yes. He's always telling me

360
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,080
that nothing has been more enjoyable for him than...

361
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,820
What was the suspect's name again?

362
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,300
Oh yes, it was Tenma.

363
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,400
That chasing after a criminal like Tenma is the most fun he could ever have.

364
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,120
