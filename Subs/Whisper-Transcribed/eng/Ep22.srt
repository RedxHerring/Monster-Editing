00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,040
Excuse me, officer.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,820
Sir, sir, just a couple of questions, please.

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,220
Stay there! Stay right there! Hold it!

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,120
Back off! You're interfering with a crime scene!

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,000
Do we have any leads?

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,840
Can you please tell us what the police are thinking?

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,380
What are your views on this situation?

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,900
Do you believe the case is linked to the serial murders?

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,320
Mr. and Mrs. Yope were quite wealthy and have no children, right?

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,860
No matter how you look at it, it's obvious this incident is exactly like the other cases of murdered middle-aged couples across Germany.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,800
No comment at this time.

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,800
I've heard that the BKA is sending an agent to look into this. Is that true?

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Does that mean there's a connection to the serial murders?

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
No comment.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Aw, man.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,800
I think I'd have better luck talking to a BKA suit directly than trying to get this guy to give me anything.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Just trust me, alright?

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
I promise you will be the first ones with a story. Just make sure you leave plenty of space on the front page.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Just do it. I gotta go.

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,580
Excuse me, sir. My name is Kipper. I'm with the Hamburg Tog.

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,820
You've been sent here by the BKA to investigate this murder.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,180
Correct me if I'm wrong.

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,600
I was wondering, is this case somehow connected to the other serial murders?

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,540
Well, Kipper of the Hamburg Tog, you're right on both counts.

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,300
Get your pen ready.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,320
Because here's my statement.

27
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,640
A middle-aged couple was murdered and it appears to be another serial slaying.

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,780
I knew it! And it's the suspect, that Japanese doctor?

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,780
Yes, I just saw the report. It's his M.O. The murders were carried out the same way.

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Thank you for the scoop.

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,660
Gotta run.

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,840
Oh, one more thing.

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,060
Huh?

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm aware the Hamburg Tag is the leading local newspaper, but I expect you to make sure your story gets published in every major newspaper in the country as well.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,900
Hey, consider it done. Thanks again for all your help, friend.

We'll be right back.

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:03:15,620
We'll be right back.

40
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:33,180
I have become the killer.

41
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,640
I think to myself as I approach, what's the best way to get into their house?

42
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,420
Should I knock?

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,080
I don't want to startle the Yopes by walking in on them.

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:58,200
such a friendly couple they greet me and show me to the living room these folks aren't the

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:10,040
least bit suspicious as they lead me in the husband's chair naturally I sit on the sofa

46
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:19,940
facing him a few minutes later the husband will die on the floor over there

47
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,480
but I haven't made that move yet so I have to decide when to eliminate him

48
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:32,160
I'll do it when the wife leaves the room where did she go to the kitchen to make

49
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,540
us some tea she has stabbed in the back before she even has a chance to serve it

50
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,920
Obviously then I need to make my move on the husband while she's occupied in the

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,640
kitchen. I reach in, pull out the knife. The husband sees this, panics, tries to

52
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,120
stand up. I stab him, but I miss and end up slashing him. The husband runs off

53
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,580
with blood dripping from his wounded left hand. So I try to get him again. I

54
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,900
swing the knife. This time I only puncture his right shoulder. I'm such a clumsy

55
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,940
amateur. Desperately the husband yells his wife's name, only she can't hear him

56
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,680
from out in the kitchen recently she's developed a hearing problem yes turns

57
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,680
out I knew about that didn't I go on shout all you want I can take my time to

58
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,780
kill you and then your wife you're trapped there's your left hand print on

59
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,220
the wall you can't get away from me I've got you pinned against this table

60
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:35,040
you're finished but then something prevents me from completing the task

61
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,040
It's five meters from this point to where the husband dies.

62
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,040
How come? Why not just eliminate him here and be done with it?

63
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Why wait?

64
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
I've never seen him.

65
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Do you suspect he's the one who broke in and murdered my neighbors?

66
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
For the moment I can only say he's a person of interest,

67
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
but I'm asking everybody in the neighborhood

68
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
for their cooperation in this matter.

69
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
If you see this man, just act normal.

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
I don't want him to become suspicious.

71
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Then get in touch with me as soon as you possibly can.

72
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,040
That would be all I need for you to do.

73
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,040
I personally assure you, you won't be in any danger.

74
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Hard to imagine such a tragic event like this happening here.

75
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,040
It's such a pleasant, quiet neighborhood.

76
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
It really is.

77
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,040
And the Yopes were such nice people, just the best.

78
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,020
the best when I call out to her from my doorstep mrs. yo pay would always greet

79
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,400
me cheerfully that's very interesting I've been told mrs. yo pay lost her

80
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,760
hearing about a year ago and refused a hearing aid huh are you sure it was in

81
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,980
her medical record if I had to guess she really couldn't hear any of your

82
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,620
greetings oh well knowing the type of person she was she probably sensed my

83
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,260
presence and wanted to make me feel good so then in your opinion nobody else in

84
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:07,900
the neighborhood knew about her hearing loss either no I wouldn't think so it

85
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,000
certainly appears that your business is booming you made rapid progress at an

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,420
early age it's not easy for a young man to achieve such quick success mr. jeep

87
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,560
oh you're right the contracts I made with the car manufacturers just happened

88
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,440
to work out before we begin I'd like to extend my deepest condolences for the

89
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,680
recent loss of your aunt and uncle. Thank you. Their passing was a great loss. They were the

90
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,720
only relatives I had left in the world. It appears they never had any children of their own,

91
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,140
so they must have taken good care of you since you were their only nephew.

92
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,620
Yes. They treated me as if I were their son. Sir, tell me you'll be able to catch the murderer.

93
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,300
I will. I'm pretty sure I know who's behind it. Me too. I bet it was that Japanese doctor,

94
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,140
wasn't it? Sounds like you're very well informed. Well, of course I am. As a matter of fact,

95
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,760
I've heard he's been linked to other murders similar to this I'm curious just

96
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,060
how much do you stand to inherit you see I found out that mr. yo pay was quite a

97
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,260
wealthy man so what his wealth has nothing to do with this serial murder

98
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:17,380
case sir I presume you are the sole heir to their considerable estate seeing as

99
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,180
how you are their only nephew it's inappropriate to be discussing my

100
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,780
inheritance in these circumstances a company can appear to be booming on the

101
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,760
surface but underneath may have serious cash flow problems that have gotten out

102
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,560
of hand it's a common occurrence in the business world just a minute you're

103
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,280
implying I murdered them when there's a serial killer on the loose how dare you

104
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,660
what are you so worried about you have a perfect alibi for the time in question

105
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:49,000
and you have plenty of witnesses you bought your secretary and some others a

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,320
a nice dinner after a long meeting what what exactly are you getting at that it

107
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,600
appears that you could not be the murderer I'm sure you agree

108
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,600
inspector lungi well what do you want kipper what the hell is going on going

109
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,160
on with what don't play dumb inspector I've been out digging up stuff on that

110
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,240
nephew for the last couple days his company looks profitable at first glance

111
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,700
but turns out to be holding a lot of bad stocks and bonds.

112
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,400
Cash-wise, it's in a world of hurt.

113
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,500
And now, I found out you've been investigating the same company.

114
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,680
I want the truth. Who killed those folks, Lungay?

115
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,300
In light of what you've uncovered,

116
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,520
do you still think this case is related to the other middle-aged murders?

117
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,960
All of the newspapers have printed a variation of my story.

118
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,080
If the cases aren't related, then it's just sensational journalism.

119
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,080
My reputation could be damaged.

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,700
Your instincts are correct.

121
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,460
It's the work of a copycat.

122
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,980
It was set up to look like the serial killer.

123
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,600
That's just great.

124
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,720
I've got to publish a retraction right away.

125
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,240
No.

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,300
It's fine as it is.

127
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,680
Huh?

128
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,240
You'll continue writing your follow-up stories

129
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,100
as if this case were another one of the middle-aged couple murders.

130
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,640
What?

131
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,680
It's not ethical.

132
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,480
No way.

133
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,680
I won't do it, I tell you.

134
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,920
Oh, but you will.

135
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,460
I'm an honest journalist who believes in reporting the whole truth.

136
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,380
And you're not going to tell me what I can write.

137
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,540
Well, let me give you the truth.

138
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,380
You have good taste, really. She's quite lovely.

139
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,660
You have a pleasant home,

140
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,280
with a devoted wife and a doting daughter who both adore you.

141
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,980
But it was impossible for you to resist the charms

142
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,560
of that attractive other woman, wasn't it?

143
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,860
Continue as before.

144
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,840
No, beef it up a little.

145
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,020
Write a special report about the serial murders.

146
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,540
If you do as I've asked,

147
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,700
He'll most certainly come

148
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
I'm counting on you

149
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,580
Yes, who is it

150
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,220
Excuse me ma'am. May I ask you some questions?

151
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,660
Well sounds like the yo pace were really a wonderful couple

152
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,140
They were.

153
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,320
I see. And you're absolutely certain they didn't have any adopted children?

154
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,220
Oh, yes.

155
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,160
Did any children, children that you'd never seen before, live with them, even for a short time?

156
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,320
No, never. But they took very good care of their nephew. He was the apple of their eye.

157
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,860
Ah, would you like more tea? It won't take a minute.

158
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,280
Uh, I'm fine.

159
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,460
A little more tea won't hurt you.

160
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:42,920
There's no mistaking him.

161
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,820
He's the man from that photo, and he's in my dining room right now.

162
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,460
Nothing to worry about.

163
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,340
Thanks for your cooperation.

164
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,900
Inspector Lungay, someone's here to see you.

165
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,440
Well, who is it?

166
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,140
He says he's the nephew of the Yopes, that couple that was killed.

167
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:10,620
inspector you believe i'm the one who murdered them i'm your suspect right you think i killed

168
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,640
my aunt and uncle for their money that's what you hinted at the other day let's face it we both know

169
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,100
that i have many debts right now and the inheritance money they ended up leaving me will more than

170
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:28,360
likely get me out of this whole mess however that's not the kind of person i am is that really

171
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,280
all you came here to tell me all i came here to wait a minute how dare you speak to me in such

172
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:40,520
a condescending way well if you'll excuse me there's somewhere i have to be right at the moment

173
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,240
don't you walk away i demand an apology for your disrespectful behavior

174
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,280
perhaps you weren't aware that the police had been following you well now that order has been

175
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:57,640
cancelled your local law enforcement thinks that you're innocent isn't that good enough for you mr

176
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,960
jeebel well do you agree with them or am i still the prime target of your investigation

177
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,400
you want to know if i think you're guilty that really doesn't matter to me at the moment

178
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,000
my chief concern is to catch the man i've been after

179
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,600
the blood stain over there can only mean one thing

180
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:33,160
he must have missed then am I to assume that you're convinced the Japanese doctor is responsible for

181
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,360
killing my aunt and uncle never assume anything I've concluded it was a copycat murder made to

182
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,700
look like the middle-aged couples homicides but how can you be so certain about that because

183
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:53,040
there's one element this case has it makes it different from all the others the killer cornered

184
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,760
victim here but he doesn't finish him off he waits till his victim gets over there before

185
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,880
delivering the final blow but why why does the murderer hesitate

186
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:20,320
it's not him that element is emotion emotion yes you see the man i'm after always takes

187
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,920
small valuables he tries to make his crimes look like robberies he murders

188
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,660
quickly without hesitation or emotion at least that's his goal but this crime

189
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,980
scene is full of emotions the killer panicked when he saw his face and the

190
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,800
victim's face together in the mirror you needn't worry from what I've observed

191
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,780
the police in this town are totally incompetent

192
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:51,900
This crime was definitely not committed by Johan.

193
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,300
But somebody wants the police to pin it on him.

194
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,260
How much longer is this all going to continue?

195
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,560
When will it end?

196
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,720
Hello. It's been a while.

197
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,960
So we finally meet again, Dr. Tenma.

198
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,440
I've been looking all over for you, for a very long time.

199
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,280
I've been hoping to have a quiet chat with you.

200
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,400
There's no use in running away anymore.

201
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,540
Stop trying to escape and talk to me.

202
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,200
The fact is, there's no place you can hide, Dr. Tenma.

203
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,400
Yes, you're all mine.

204
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,120
Why couldn't you just leave it alone?

205
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:28,420
I'm guilty. I confess. I want to turn myself in, all right? I'm the one who came in and killed him!

206
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,780
Your confession means nothing to me. Just stay out of my way.

207
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,280
Tim, come on!

208
00:16:42,540 --> 00:17:02,380
He's been seriously wounded.

209
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,460
I've got to do something now or he's going to bleed to death.

210
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:13,360
Who could have stabbed Inspector Lungay?

211
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,560
I'll drop him off in front of the hospital and get away.

212
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,940
Damn. Where are they?

213
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,460
I need the keys to the handcuffs. Tell me where you put them, Inspector.

214
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,460
Don't bother reaching for your gun. I took it off you while you were unconscious.

215
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,460
Don't be so stubborn! Just give me the keys! I'm a doctor, but I can't help you like this!

216
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,460
I examined your wound the best I could. It appears that only your muscles sustain the damage.

217
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,460
But you're losing an awful lot of blood. If we don't stop the bleeding, you're going to die!

218
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,180
Come on, confess. Do it, Dr. Tenma.

219
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
Confess to what?

220
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,240
That you murdered the director of Eisler Memorial Hospital along with three others.

221
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,660
And that you've been on a three-year killing spree targeting middle-aged couples.

222
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,400
It's time to come clean and admit what you've done.

223
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,240
If you keep this up, you'll be a dead man.

224
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,100
Come on, Doctor. Don't try to fool me.

225
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,480
You're only fooling yourself by running around chasing this elusive Johan.

226
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,760
Johan doesn't exist. Admit it. You made him up. You're a killer.

227
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,420
You're Johan, Dr. Tenma. Own up to it.

228
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,320
Inspector, right now you require emergency treatment.

229
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,820
I have everything I need to do the procedure.

230
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,780
Except for my hands! They're my tools and I can't save your life with them chained together!

231
00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:01,500
Yes. When you're the well-liked Dr. Tenma, those are the hands of a highly skilled surgeon who has saved many lives.

232
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,020
But how many people have you killed with those hands?

233
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,540
You've got it wrong. I'm not a killer.

234
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,480
No, but you change into Johan.

235
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,400
When does the good doctor turn into the bad monster?

236
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,960
I already told you, you're mistaken.

237
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,820
Then let me tell you, I never make mistakes.

238
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,600
Your blood pressure's falling. You're going to lose consciousness soon.

239
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,480
Your crime scenes are always...

240
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,220
No more talking. It'll weaken you.

241
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,980
Your crime scenes are always lacking in something an emotional factor

242
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,340
Save your strength dealing with life and death every day forces doctors to check their emotions

243
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:50,420
Right. Dr. Tenma you develop a cold exterior and it's that coldness. I always find it your crime scenes

244
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,780
Cold calm emotionless taking of life. I am NOT that kind of man

245
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,300
Every time I operate a thousand emotions go through my head

246
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,020
They affect my every decision.

247
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,200
Is my diagnosis accurate?

248
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,420
Will there be any unforeseen complications?

249
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,480
Will my patient even survive?

250
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,620
How can I be calm when I hold a person's life in my hands?

251
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,860
In these hands.

252
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,100
How in the hell can I be calm?

253
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,520
Don't come closer. Stop.

254
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,920
I can save you.

255
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,260
I will. Shoot.

256
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,720
I need my hands to stop the bleeding.

257
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,320
Are the keys in your pants pocket?

258
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:34,920
Tell me.

259
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,320
I will.

260
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,100
You really had us worried for a while.

261
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,080
But you're looking quite well.

262
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,240
Lots better than when you're running around investigating crimes.

263
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,860
I guess this means you're not rid of me yet.

264
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,340
Yeah, you'll be back on your feet in no time.

265
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,860
That emergency procedure you received before you got here was done perfectly.

266
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,300
Your doctor said you wouldn't be alive without it.

267
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,860
I'm assuming that Temma got his hands free and used them to save my life.

268
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,200
Yeah, well, he got away, but we got Jeebel.

269
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,360
He confessed to murdering the Yope couple.

270
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,580
He stabbed you because you were on to him.

271
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,840
You did good, Lunge.

272
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,920
Thank you.

273
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,800
Well, what do you think?

274
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,820
About what?

275
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,120
It's quite clear that Tenma saved Lunge's life,

276
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,440
so I'm worried Lunge might have a problem pursuing him now.

277
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,820
I'm wondering if I should remove him from the Tenma case.

278
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm sorry, did he call for you again?

279
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,940
Inspector Lunge can be very demanding.

280
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
Oh, he really isn't that difficult at all.

281
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,320
In fact, I find him to be very pleasant.

282
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,460
I keep telling him not to rush through the recovery process,

283
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,740
but he's quite determined.

284
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,740
He's already working on strengthening his grip and he's taking long walks down the hall.

285
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,740
He seems to be having a really fun time recovering.

286
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
He's having fun?

287
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,740
Yes, he's always telling me that nothing has been more enjoyable for him than...

288
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,740
What was the suspect's name again?

289
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,740
Oh yes, it was Tenma.

290
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,740
That chasing after a criminal like Tenma is the most fun he could ever have.
