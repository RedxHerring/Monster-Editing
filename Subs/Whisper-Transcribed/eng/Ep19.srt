1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,520
My wife and I divorced about three years ago.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,880
No, that's, uh, she divorced me three years ago.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,180
She said that I stopped listening to her, and I suppose she was right about that.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,660
This was the only thing I did really listen to by that point.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,240
My wife said I was broken.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,820
She said I was a voyeur peeking through the window at people's innermost thoughts.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:24,920
Crazy.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,920
"Doctor, you're abnormal."

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:42,920
"Maybe you're right about that. I became transfixed, obsessively gazing into the abyss of the human heart. I suppose it's possible the abyss gazes back into me. The depths of the human mind are filled with treacherous landscapes."

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:53,420
"Your fourth victim was an 18-year-old girl in Munich, I believe. I'm curious, did you experience any form of sexual arousal when you cut her up?"

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,240
I don't want to talk about her today, Doctor.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,440
I want to talk about my twelfth victim.

13
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,840
Fair enough, then.

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,340
That would be Mrs. Hanna Kemp from Krupp House, 52 years old.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,520
At that time, I was in...

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:10,900
Wait.

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,900
I'm not prepared to talk about her.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,360
I promise we will eventually get to Mrs. Kemp, but for the moment I would really like to

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,200
focus on victim number 11.

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,520
Is that alright?

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,900
Now then, the peak of your arousal, does that come before or after you commit a murder?

22
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,900
The victims were all girls with long hair, ages 16 to 18.

23
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,240
It's clear these murders should all be categorized as acts of sexual homicide, but then he confesses

24
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,260
to the murder of his twelfth victim, Mrs. Kemp.

25
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,820
Mrs. Kemp was 52 and showed no signs of sexual assault.

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,380
He claims to have killed Mrs. Kemp as a favor for a friend.

27
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,960
An obvious and desperate last-ditch attempt to disrupt the investigation.

28
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,920
Who is it?

29
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,460
Who is it? I know that you're in there.

30
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,200
It's me, Rudy.

31
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,500
Huh?

32
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,680
Tenma?

33
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,660
Well, this is a surprise.

34
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,420
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry for barging in on you like this, Rudy.

35
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,440
You've heard about my situation.

36
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,440
That's putting it mildly.

37
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,740
Well, do you think I'm a serial killer?

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,020
I don't know.

39
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:15,600
But from what I've heard, both the newspapers and our old classmates think you're as guilty as sin.

40
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,000
So, the question is, what are you doing here? Why come to me?

41
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,400
We were never exactly what you'd call "close."

42
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,580
I know for a fact you despised me.

43
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,640
I could tell from the way you looked at me.

44
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,540
I saw the contempt burning behind your eyes.

45
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,020
Ah-ha, that's what this is all about.

46
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,820
You've come to collect what you think I owe you.

47
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,100
Is that it?

48
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,640
It's not like that at all.

49
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,800
You've become a noted specialist in criminal psychology.

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,560
I have something I'd like you to take a look at.

51
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,720
My dear Dr. Tenma, look at me.

52
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,180
Look at me.

53
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
The monster inside me is getting bigger.

54
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,100
Help. The monster inside me is about to explode.

55
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,900
What on earth is this?

56
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,100
Quite a story.

57
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,640
So, ten years ago, you saved a boy's life who went on to kill the hospital director, some staff, and his foster parents.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,520
Then he's gone, leaving no trace other than a series of cryptic messages addressed to you.

59
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,700
Which is why it's so urgent that I find out where he is now.

60
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,560
Because you think by finding him, you'll also find something that might prove your innocence.

61
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,440
Twenty years ago, there was a young man attending a prestigious medical school.

62
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,200
He was driven to be top of his class.

63
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,980
One day, a Japanese transfer student came and changed everything.

64
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,960
This new student was charming, quickly gaining the respect of peers and teachers alike.

65
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,180
He had a brilliant mind as well, claiming his position as the top of his class within his first semester.

66
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,280
Much to the man's dismay.

67
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,360
By the next semester, he had become obsessed with regaining his title.

68
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,920
He had managed to earn full marks in all his classes so far.

69
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,500
However, his last test was in his weakest subject, medical law.

70
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,060
If he failed this test, then all of his efforts would go to waste.

71
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,960
So he resorted to desperate measures.

72
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,120
Measures he thought would put him back on top.

73
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,160
But he was caught.

74
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,360
The Japanese student never told anyone about what he had seen.

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,960
As a result, the man regained his throne.

76
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,440
So is there anything you can tell me about this man based on the contents of these letters?

77
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,360
You think it may be multiple personality disorder.

78
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,680
And you've come to the conclusion that one of the personalities is committing these murders,

79
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,300
while the other personality is trying to get caught.

80
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,340
Yes, instances of serial killers leaving these sorts of notes are not unheard of.

81
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,620
Just as often, these notes are fabricated as legal proof of their insanity.

82
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,660
Separating the pretender from the genuine article is the art of the criminal psychologist.

83
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,660
And believe you me, this is no easy task.

84
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,760
The introverted, shifty-eyed serial killer is more or less a Hollywood fabrication.

85
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,560
Many killers are highly intelligent, intuitive, and extremely charming.

86
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,800
They are adaptive and skillful liars.

87
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,820
[ Chuckles ]

88
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,680
So that's it?

89
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,360
You think he might be toying with me?

90
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,440
Well, let's not add to the mounting pile of conjecture just yet.

91
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,760
Why don't you tell me a little bit more about this, Johan?

92
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,100
My wife and I got divorced about three years ago.

93
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,980
What I mean to say is, my wife divorced me three years ago.

94
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Thank you, Rudy.

95
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,200
Don't mention it, Temma.

96
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,720
This is a very fascinating case you brought me.

97
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,740
I need to do some research.

98
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,740
Give me a call next week, all right?

99
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,700
Do you have an opinion about this person?

100
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,820
Seems like my kind of guy.

101
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,300
Hmm. Can you elaborate on that?

102
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,120
The monster.

103
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,260
I get all that.

104
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,280
That's interesting.

105
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,500
You get the monster.

106
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,880
Makes sense, of course.

107
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,560
To be fair, there's even a monster inside of me.

108
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,120
Shut your mouth.

109
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,700
Huh?

110
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,220
That's nothing but textbook garbage.

111
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,140
Why is that?

112
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,640
What I'm telling you, Doctor, is that a real monster does exist.

113
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,420
What do you think you're doing?

114
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,040
Just stop looking at me like that.

115
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,360
Don't you dare look at me with such contempt!

116
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,860
What are you doing?

117
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,180
I'm calling the guards.

118
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,860
Well, are you scared yet?

119
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Are you scared?

120
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,040
Huh?

121
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,340
Because there are things out there that will turn your blood to ice, Doctor.

122
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,840
I'm going to tell you a secret.

123
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,260
You're really still convinced that Tenma's going to try and contact you again?

125
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm sure of it.

126
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,920
And when he does, I'll notify you immediately.

127
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,220
However...

128
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,600
Well, go on.

129
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,220
After his arrest, I would like to get permission to use him and his case in my research.

130
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,220
Dr. Tenma would make a compelling subject.

131
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,080
He has a complex criminal mind.

132
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm going to tell you a secret.

133
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,120
Go to Ms. Hana Kim's house in Krupp House.

134
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,800
Make your way to the basement.

135
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,720
You're going to find all of your answers down there.

136
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,840
Down there you'll find proof.

137
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,780
Proof the monster really does exist.

138
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:55,800
This is Rudy. Ah, Tenma. I've been waiting for your call. Yeah, alright. Excellent, I'll

139
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:02,780
see you there. Officer Cole, Tenma just called. We've arranged for a meeting tonight. Odair

140
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,680
Park tonight at 8. By the fountain, that's right. Goodbye then.

141
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,480
I'm currently retracing Juergen's steps on the day of his twelfth confessed murder. According

142
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,180
to our interviews, he broke into the basement and stayed hidden there for several hours.

143
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,660
Later, when Mrs. Kemp returned home, he made his way into the upstairs bedroom and murdered

144
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:42,200
her there there's nothing out of the ordinary except there are framed photos

145
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,800
all over the basement they're all pictures of mrs. Kemp

146
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,240
Just a doll almost gave me a heart attack.

147
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,040
Evidence of this so-called monster Jürgen sent me to find clearly isn't here.

148
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,620
This supports my theory that Jürgen's committed the twelfth murder to confuse investigators.

149
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,040
His first explanation was that he committed the murder as a favor for a friend, one he

150
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,600
the Primal Monster Archetype, he...

151
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,220
When I was a kid, my mother would beat me every day.

152
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,860
she would do she would take me into the basement it was dark and she had this

153
00:12:52,860 --> 00:13:00,580
big doll down there a doll of long hair sometimes when she beat me I would cry

154
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:06,640
to the doll for help it would just sit there and smirk and watch the basement

155
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:13,820
was filled with pictures of my mother wherever I tried to look mother mother

156
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:23,900
mother mother always watching no escape but what does it mean exact in every

157
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,440
detail is it possible did Juergens actually recreate the basement from his

158
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,980
childhood

159
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,140
The boy next to Mrs. Kemp is Juergens.

160
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,200
It can't be.

161
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,360
There's no evidence connecting young Juergens to Mrs. Kemp.

162
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,260
Huh? Something is not right here.

163
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,700
It seems that Juergens' face was pasted into the photograph.

164
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,760
This one. And this one. And another.

165
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,800
All of these.

166
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Mrs. Kemp never had any children.

167
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,580
So who is this boy?

168
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,080
Who are you?

169
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,240
Down there you'll find proof.

170
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,220
Proof the monster really does exist.

171
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,360
I followed all of the instructions that my friend left me in the letter perfectly.

172
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,340
Friend? Who was he?

173
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,700
Just listen.

174
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,100
The first letter came in a blank envelope without a name or return address.

175
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,320
He'd want to say he understood me, sympathized with me, crap like that.

176
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:59,460
I was annoyed, angry at first, but then another one came, and then another the next day, and

177
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,540
again, and so on.

178
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,480
He's a letter freak.

179
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,680
But before I knew it, I started to expect the letters, even enjoy them a bit.

180
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,620
Then I thought, maybe it's possible he might actually be a friend to me.

181
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,420
And then one day, one of his letters asked me for something.

182
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,960
He asked me to go down to the basement of this house.

183
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,840
And did the basement belong to Mrs. Kemp?

184
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,300
I still don't know how he could have known.

185
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,880
There's no way he could possibly have known what happened to me down there when I was a kid.

186
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,120
But somehow, he got everything right, down to the smallest detail.

187
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,880
How did he do that?

188
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,140
I just got so confused.

189
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,160
Was Mrs. Kemp my mother?

190
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,360
The next thing I knew, I was upstairs, and Mrs. Kemp was dead.

191
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,780
He's a letter freak.

192
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,700
That friend of his must have sent letters to Mrs. Kemp as well.

193
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,360
(dramatic music)

194
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,800
What is this?

195
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,800
Another?

196
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,760
And this, another one.

197
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,900
Look at me.

198
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,420
Look at me.

199
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,300
The monster inside me is getting bigger.

200
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,060
Help me.

201
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,480
The monster inside of me is about to explode.

202
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,020
These are the messages that Johan left me.

203
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,100
They're the same.

204
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,480
Juergens' friend and Johan...

205
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,680
He's real.

206
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,500
Anything yet? It's way past eight already.

207
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,440
Inspector Cole. Hold on.

208
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,920
Target in sight.

209
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,000
Asian male. Long hair.

210
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,700
I appreciate you making time for this, Rudy.

211
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,780
I want you to know I did research what you gave me.

212
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,220
But I thought you were making it up.

213
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,880
I thought that Johan was just a ruse, a scapegoat you created to buy you time once you were caught.

214
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,360
You've got to believe me! Rudy!

215
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,900
I've been conducting research on a serial killer named Juergens, and something he said caught my attention.

216
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,400
One of his victims is off-pattern, showing no connection to profile or ritual.

217
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,480
It doesn't matter, Rudy! Please just listen to me!

218
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,160
Okay, listen up, everyone! We're finished for today! We'll see you tomorrow!

219
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,180
Seems like the carnival is wrapping up.

220
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,800
Everyone in position. Make sure they're ready to move in on my mark.

221
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,500
Yes, sir.

222
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,200
I want every detail of their conversation.

223
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,960
Tenma, you hated me, didn't you?

224
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,600
Huh?

225
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,260
You've hated me ever since you caught me cheating on that exam in college.

226
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,500
I can feel your disdain.

227
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,580
Go ahead, say it.

228
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,500
Inspector Cole, this doesn't look good.

229
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,060
Dr. Gien and Tenma are headed toward the west exit.

230
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,900
Damn. We'll lose them and that crowd that's leaving.

231
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,480
You'd be well within your right. A man like me doesn't deserve your respect.

232
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,800
Rudy, this isn't the time to remin--

233
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,940
Listen to me. Now then, I looked up the answers and wrote them all down on a cheat sheet.

234
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,080
A sheet just like this one.

235
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,320
Run. We're surrounded by the police.

236
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,660
Don't look. Just walk.

237
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,360
Is Dr. Tenma threatening Gillen?

238
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,100
There's too much background noise for me to hear.

239
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,940
Juergens recently confessed to me that he had killed Mrs. Kemp at the request of a friend.

240
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,840
Rudy, what is this?

241
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,880
Something I found in Mrs. Kemp's basement.

242
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,220
But Mrs. Kemp never had any children.

243
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,820
I have found compelling evidence to suggest that Juergens' friend and your Johan are both one and the same.

244
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,100
They've passed through the west exit. Should we move in?

245
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,320
Tell everyone to hold their positions! He may be armed!

246
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,160
I found a letter from Johan in Mrs. Kemp's house.

247
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,900
It was almost identical to the one you brought me.

248
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,820
I believe that Johan had been in the care of Mrs. Kemp at some point in his life.

249
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,700
That would explain his motivation for orchestrating her death.

250
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,980
You're an innocent man, Tenma.

251
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,440
I'm sorry I can't give you as much detail as perhaps you'd like, but here's what I've worked out on Johan so far.

252
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,940
I don't know how he does it, but Johan can somehow identify other killers.

253
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,720
He finds them, worms his way in, beguiles them, then manipulates them.

254
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:27,600
It is worth noting that, to the best of our knowledge, he hasn't killed the foster parents who cared for him as a teenager.

255
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,680
Probably because by the time he reached that age, he no longer found himself dependent on anyone.

256
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,660
Perhaps. But I have another theory.

257
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,680
What if Johan found himself his ideal family,

258
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,340
and then became a part of it?

259
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,120
But why work so hard to erase his past?

260
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,980
Was there an ulterior motive?

261
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,560
If that is indeed the case,

262
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,740
did he make his way into the family for a specific purpose?

263
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,480
And what would that purpose be?

264
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,600
Well, we're at the bus terminal.

265
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:10,040
Yes, confirm which bus ten was getting on they get a car over to the terminal and have him follow. Yes, sir

266
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,360
Here the least I could do is buy you a bus ticket

267
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,680
You know

268
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,680
There's still time for you to turn yourself in and prove your innocence. Tenma. I promise I can help you

269
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,580
The truth is I'm not chasing after Johan just so I can prove my innocence

270
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,080
Thank you for all your help Rudy

271
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,280
Tenma, you don't have to become him to end this.

272
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,620
That reminds me.

273
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,720
I really didn't despise you back in college, Rudy.

274
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,000
I mean it.

275
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,040
I thought you were brilliant, and it was a shame we never had a chance to talk.

276
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,120
I'm glad that I can finally count you as a friend.

277
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,300
But I know you caught me cheating on that medical law exam.

278
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,700
There's no doubt about it.

279
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,480
I saw you looking directly at me and my cheat sheet.

280
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,560
"Well, yeah, I cheated on the medical law exam, too."

281
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,580
"He got away?

282
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,400
All five buses left at the same time?"

283
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,280
"Be careful, Tenma."
