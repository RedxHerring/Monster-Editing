1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
my wife and I divorced about three years ago no that's uh she divorced me three years ago she

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,920
said that I stopped listening to her and I suppose she was right about that this was the only thing I

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,720
did really listen to by that point my wife said I was broken she said it was a voyeur peeking

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:29,380
through the window at people's innermost thoughts. Crazy. Doctor, you're abnormal.

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,220
Maybe you're right about that. I became transfixed, obsessively gazing into the abyss of the human

6
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,940
heart. I suppose it's possible the abyss gazes back into me. The depths of the human mind are

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,480
filled with treacherous landscapes. Your fourth victim was an 18-year-old girl in Munich, I

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,640
believe I'm curious did you experience any form of sexual arousal when you cut

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,600
her up I don't want to talk about her today doctor I want to talk about my

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,500
12th victim fair enough then that would be mrs. Hana Kemp from Krupp house 52

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:14,020
years old at that time I was in wait I'm not prepared to talk about her I promise

12
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,180
we will eventually get to mrs. Kemp but for the moment I would really like to

13
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,000
to focus on victim number 11.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
Is that all right?

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,000
- Now then, the peak of your arousal,

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,260
does that come before or after you commit a murder?

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:02:17,160
We'll be right back.

18
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:27,180
♪♪♪

19
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:37,180
♪♪♪

20
00:02:37,180 --> 00:03:03,800
the victims were all girls with long hair ages 16 to 18 it's clear these murders should all

21
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,040
be categorized as acts of sexual homicide.

22
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,760
But then he confesses to the murder

23
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,400
of his 12th victim, Mrs. Kemp.

24
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,560
Mrs. Kemp was 52 and showed no signs of sexual assault.

25
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,740
He claims to have killed Mrs. Kemp as a favor for a friend,

26
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,660
an obvious and desperate last-ditch attempt

27
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,300
to disrupt the investigation.

28
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,980
Who is it?

29
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Who is it? I know that you're in there.

30
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,120
It's me, Rudy.

31
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,520
Huh?

32
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,680
Tenma?

33
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,660
Well, this is a surprise.

34
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,400
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry for barging in on you like this, Rudy.

35
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,440
You've heard about my situation.

36
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,440
That's putting it mildly.

37
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,740
Well, do you think I'm a serial killer?

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,040
I don't know.

39
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,240
But from what I've heard,

40
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,600
both the newspapers and our old classmates think you're as guilty as sin.

41
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,720
So the question is, what are you doing here?

42
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,000
Why come to me?

43
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,960
We were never exactly what you'd call close.

44
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,580
I know for a fact you despised me.

45
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,620
I could tell from the way you looked at me.

46
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,560
I saw the contempt burning behind your eyes.

47
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,020
Uh-huh, that's what this is all about.

48
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,820
You've come to collect what you think I owe you.

49
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,080
Is that it?

50
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,640
It's not like that at all.

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,800
You've become a noted specialist in criminal psychology.

52
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,560
I have something I'd like you to take a look at.

53
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,720
My dear Dr. Tenma, look at me.

54
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,160
Look at me.

55
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,460
the monster inside me is getting bigger help the monster inside me is about to

56
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:17,700
explode what on earth is this quite a story so ten years ago you saved a boy's

57
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,340
life who went on to kill the hospital director some staff and his foster

58
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,640
parents then he's gone leaving no trace other than a series of cryptic messages

59
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,600
addressed to you which is why it's so urgent that I find out where he is now

60
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Because you think by finding him, you'll also find something that might prove your innocence.

61
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Twenty years ago, there was a young man attending a prestigious medical school.

62
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
He was driven to be top of his class.

63
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,600
One day, a Japanese transfer student came and changed everything.

64
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,600
This new student was charming, quickly gaining the respect of peers and teachers alike.

65
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,600
He had a brilliant mind as well, claiming his position as the top of his class within his first semester.

66
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Much to the man's dismay.

67
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
By the next semester, he had become obsessed with regaining his title.

68
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600
He had managed to earn full marks in all his classes so far.

69
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,600
However, his last test was in his weakest subject: medical law.

70
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,600
If he failed this test, then all of his efforts would go to waste.

71
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
So he resorted to desperate measures.

72
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Measures he thought would put him back on top.

73
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
But he was caught.

74
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,600
The Japanese student never told anyone about what he had seen.

75
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,900
As a result, the man regained his throne.

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,440
So is there anything you can tell me about this man based on the contents of these letters?

77
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,360
You think it may be multiple personality disorder.

78
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,680
And you've come to the conclusion that one of the personalities is committing these murders

79
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,300
while the other personality is trying to get caught.

80
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Yes, instances of serial killers leaving these sorts of notes are not unheard of.

81
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Just as often, these notes are fabricated as legal proof of their insanity.

82
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Separating the pretender from the genuine article is the art of the criminal psychologist.

83
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
And believe you me, this is no easy task.

84
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,600
The introverted, shifty-eyed serial killer is more or less a Hollywood fabrication.

85
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Many killers are highly intelligent, intuitive, and extremely charming.

86
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,600
They are adaptive and skillful liars.

87
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,360
So that's it? You think he might be toying with me?

88
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,460
Well, let's not add to the mounting pile of conjecture just yet.

89
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,760
Why don't you tell me a little bit more about this, Johan?

90
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,100
My wife and I got divorced about three years ago.

91
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,980
What I mean to say is my wife divorced me three years ago.

92
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,840
Thank you, Rudy.

93
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,700
Don't mention it, Timma. This is a very fascinating case you brought me.

94
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,740
I need to do some research. Give me a call next week, all right?

95
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,740
Do you have an opinion about this person?

96
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,840
Seems like my kind of guy.

97
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,300
Hmm. Can you elaborate on that?

98
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,280
The monster. I get all that.

99
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,540
That's interesting. You get the monster.

100
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,980
Makes sense, of course. There's a monster inside both of you.

101
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,560
To be fair, there's even a monster inside of me.

102
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,120
Shut your mouth.

103
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,720
Huh?

104
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,240
That's nothing but textbook garbage.

105
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Why is that?

106
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,240
What I'm telling you, Doctor, is that a real monster does exist.

107
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
What do you think you're doing?

108
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Just stop looking at me like that.

109
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Don't you dare look at me with such contempt!

110
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
What are you doing?

111
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
I'm calling the guards!

112
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Well, are you scared yet? Are you scared?

113
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Because there are things out there that will turn your blood to ice, Doctor.

114
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm going to tell you a secret.

115
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Thank you for your cooperation.

116
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,240
You're really still convinced that Tenma's going to try and contact you again?

117
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm sure of it.

118
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,920
And when he does, I'll notify you immediately.

119
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,480
However...

120
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,620
Well, go on.

121
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,240
After his arrest, I would like to get permission to use him and his case in my research.

122
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,200
Dr. Tenma would make a compelling subject.

123
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,080
He has a complex criminal mind.

124
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,260
I'm going to tell you a secret.

125
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,120
Go to Ms. Hana Kemp's house in Krupp House.

126
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,800
Make your way to the basement.

127
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,700
You're going to find all of your answers down there.

128
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,820
Down there you'll find proof.

129
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,880
Proof the monster really does exist.

130
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,700
This is Rudy.

131
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,300
Ah, Tenma.

132
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:57,980
I've been waiting for your call yeah all right excellent I'll see you there

133
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,900
officer Cole Tim I just called we've arranged for a meeting tonight

134
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,580
Oh dare Park tonight at 8:00 by the fountain that's right

135
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:17,580
goodbye then I'm currently retracing Jurgen steps on the day of his 12th

136
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,940
confessed murder. According to our interviews, he broke into the basement and stayed hidden

137
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:29,300
there for several hours. Later, when Mrs. Kemp returned home, he made his way into the

138
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:40,940
upstairs bedroom and murdered her there. There's nothing out of the ordinary, except there

139
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:48,700
framed photos all over the basement they're all pictures of mrs. Kemp

140
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,780
just a doll almost gave me a heart attack evidence of this so-called

141
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,900
monster Jurgen sent me to find clearly isn't here the supports my theory that

142
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,800
Juergens committed the twelfth murder to confuse investigators his first

143
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,060
explanation was that he committed the murder as a favor for a friend one he

144
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,100
associates with a primal monster archetype he

145
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:45,220
When I was a kid, my mother would beat me every day.

146
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,800
What she would do, she would take me into the basement.

147
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,820
It was dark, and she had this big doll down there, a doll with long hair.

148
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Sometimes when she beat me, I would cry to the doll for help,

149
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,100
and it would just sit there and smirk and watch.

150
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,100
The basement was filled with pictures of my mother.

151
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Wherever I tried to look,

152
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,100
mother, mother, mother, mother, always watching.

153
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,100
No escape.

154
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,100
But what does it mean?

155
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
Exact in every detail.

156
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Is it possible?

157
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Did Juergens actually recreate the basement from his childhood?

158
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:44,140
The boy next to Mrs. Kemp is Juergens.

159
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,180
It can't be.

160
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,360
There's no evidence connecting young Juergens to Mrs. Kemp.

161
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,460
Huh?

162
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,220
Something is not right here.

163
00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:06,720
It seems that Jürgens' face was pasted into the photograph

164
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,120
This one

165
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,920
And this one

166
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,780
And another

167
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,840
All of these

168
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,380
Mrs. Kemp never had any children

169
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:33,280
so who is this boy who are you down there you'll find proof proof the monster really does exist

170
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,420
i followed all of the instructions and my friend left me in the letter perfectly

171
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:46,540
friend who was he just listen the first letter came in a blank envelope without a name or return

172
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:53,300
address you have to say he understood me sympathize with me crap like that I was

173
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,720
annoyed angry at first but then another one came and then another the next day

174
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,380
and again and so on he's a letter freak

175
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:13,060
but before I knew it I started to expect the letters even enjoy them a bit then I

176
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:19,060
I thought maybe it's possible he might actually be a friend to me and then one

177
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,680
day one of his letters asked me for something he asked me to go down to the

178
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:32,800
basement of this house and did the basement belong to mrs. camp I still

179
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,380
don't know how he could have known there's no way he could possibly have

180
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,880
known what happened to me down there when I was a kid but somehow he got

181
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,460
everything right down to the smallest detail how do you do that I just got so

182
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:55,960
confused was mrs. Kemp my mother the next thing I knew I was upstairs and

183
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:02,700
mrs. Kemp was dead he's a letter freak a friend of his must have sent letters to

184
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,640
mrs. Kemp as well

185
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,820
What is this?

186
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Another?

187
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,200
And this?

188
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,760
Another one?

189
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,900
Look at me.

190
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,400
Look at me.

191
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,320
The monster inside me is getting bigger.

192
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,060
Help me.

193
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,480
The monster inside of me is about to explode.

194
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,860
These are the messages that Johan left me.

195
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,120
They're the same.

196
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,680
Juergens' friend. And Johan. He's real.

197
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,520
Anything yet? It's way past eight already.

198
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,780
Inspector Cole, hold on.

199
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,940
Target in sight.

200
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,020
Asian male. Long hair.

201
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,700
I appreciate you making time for this, Rudy.

202
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,800
I want you to know I did research what you gave me.

203
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,200
But I thought you were making it up.

204
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,600
I thought that Johan was just a ruse.

205
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,860
A scapegoat you created to buy you time once you were caught.

206
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,720
You've got to believe me

207
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,380
Rudy

208
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,780
I've been conducting research on a serial killer named Juergens

209
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,900
And something he said caught my attention

210
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,960
One of his victims is off pattern

211
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,400
Showing no connection to profile or ritual

212
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,100
It doesn't matter, Rudy

213
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,520
Please just listen to me

214
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,400
Okay, listen up, everyone

215
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,700
We're finished for today

216
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,220
We'll see you tomorrow

217
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,240
Seems like the carnival is wrapping up

218
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,040
Everyone in position

219
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,800
Make sure they're ready to move in on my mark

220
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,520
Yes, sir

221
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,200
I want every detail of their conversation.

222
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,940
Tenma, you hated me, didn't you?

223
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:18,600
Huh?

224
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,260
You've hated me ever since you caught me cheating on that exam in college.

225
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,500
I can feel your disdain.

226
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,560
Go ahead, say it.

227
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,500
Inspector Cole, this doesn't look good.

228
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,080
Dr. Guillen and Tenma are headed toward the west exit.

229
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,820
Damn, we'll lose them in that crowd that's leaving.

230
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,100
You'd be well within your right.

231
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,980
A man like me doesn't deserve your respect.

232
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,880
- Rudy, this isn't the time to reminisce.

233
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,180
- Listen to me.

234
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,200
Now then, I looked up the answers

235
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,520
and wrote them all down on a cheat sheet.

236
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,300
A sheet just like this one.

237
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,340
- Run, we're surrounded by the police.

238
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,780
- Don't look, just walk.

239
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,780
- Is Dr. Tenma threatening Gillen?

240
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,020
- I'm not sure, sir.

241
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,380
There's too much background noise for me to hear.

242
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,440
- Hey, it's my turn.

243
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,900
Juergens recently confessed to me that he had killed Mrs. Kemp at the request of a friend.

244
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,820
Rudy, what is this?

245
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,880
Something I found in Mrs. Kemp's basement.

246
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,220
But Mrs. Kemp never had any children.

247
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,840
I have found compelling evidence to suggest that Juergens' friend and your Johan are both one and the same.

248
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,100
They've passed through the west exit. Should we move in?

249
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,340
Tell everyone to hold their positions. He may be armed.

250
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,160
I found a letter from Johan in Mrs. Kemp's house.

251
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,900
It was almost identical to the one you brought me.

252
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,800
I believe that Johan had been in the care of Mrs. Kemp at some point in his life.

253
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,680
That would explain his motivation for orchestrating her death.

254
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,980
You're an innocent man, Tenma.

255
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,940
I'm sorry I can't give you as much detail as perhaps you'd like,

256
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,440
but here's what I've worked out on Johan so far.

257
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,940
I don't know how he does it, but Johan can somehow identify other killers.

258
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,720
He finds them, worms his way in, beguiles them, then manipulates them.

259
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,780
It is worth noting that, to the best of our knowledge,

260
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,600
he hasn't killed the foster parents who cared for him as a teenager.

261
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,680
Probably because by the time he reached that age, he no longer found himself dependent on anyone.

262
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,620
Perhaps. But I have another theory.

263
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,680
What if Johan found himself his ideal family?

264
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,360
and then became a part of it.

265
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,120
But why work so hard to erase his past?

266
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,960
Was there an ulterior motive?

267
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,560
If that is indeed the case,

268
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,740
did he make his way into the family for a specific purpose?

269
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,480
And what would that purpose be?

270
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,600
Well, we're at the bus terminal.

271
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,800
Yes, confirm which bus Tenma's getting on!

272
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,020
Then get a car over to the terminal and have him followed!

273
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,760
Yes, sir.

274
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,340
Here. The least I can do is buy you a bus ticket.

275
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,740
You know, there's still time for you to turn yourself in and prove your innocence, Tenma.

276
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
I promise I can help you.

277
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,460
The truth is, I'm not chasing after Johan just so I can prove my innocence.

278
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,560
Hmm?

279
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,040
Thank you for all your help, Rudy.

280
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,260
Tenma! You don't have to become him to end this.

281
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,640
That reminds me.

282
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,700
I really didn't despise you back in college, Rudy.

283
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,980
I mean it.

284
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,040
I thought you were brilliant, and it was a shame we never had a chance to talk.

285
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,100
I'm glad that I can finally count you as a friend.

286
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,320
But I know you caught me cheating on that medical law exam.

287
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,680
There's no doubt about it.

288
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,500
I saw you looking directly at me and my cheat sheet.

289
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,360
Well, yeah, I cheated on the medical law exam, too.

290
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,560
He got away!

291
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,460
All five buses left at the same time?

292
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,260
Be careful, Tenma.
