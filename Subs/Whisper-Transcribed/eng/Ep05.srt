1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,200
now class I want you to tell me what was the basis for the ruling the judge made

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,680
in regards to the 1968 Stuttgart case oh boy what is this silence where are we

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:31,540
some kind of a monastery mr. Reimer I'd like to hear your answer if you have one

4
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:39,000
well sir that is to say I anyone is there anyone in this room who can break

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:55,800
this silence so the chronic latecomer is here at last your 13 minutes tardy seems

6
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,720
your part-time pizza delivery job kept you awfully busy today I'm sorry

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,500
professor Kronecker well let me ask you a question before you sit down do you

8
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Do you have enough strength left to tell me the basis for the ruling in the 1968 Stuttgart case?

9
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Um...

10
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Oh, yes.

11
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Well...

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,500
The defense claimed that the kidnapping was a sham,

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
and that the victim's death had been due to poisoning.

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
After an investigation into the crime scene,

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
it was found that the victim's death had been accidental,

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
and that there was no motive.

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,500
So, since the crime couldn't be proven to be an intentional murder,

18
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
I believe a sentence of 15 years was handed down.

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Very good. You can take your seat, Nina Fortuna.

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Yes, Professor.

21
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:36,480
We'll be right back.

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:03:06,480
We'll be right back.

23
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,500
- Wow, good job, Nina.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,960
- If no one had been able to give him the answer,

25
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,480
I have no doubt that Kroniker would have probably demanded

26
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
we write a 50 page report.

27
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,860
- 50 pages if we were lucky.

28
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll have to treat our savior, Nina, to something to eat.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,220
What do you say, Nina, a nice meal, just the two of us?

30
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,720
- Oh, I'm sorry, Peter, but I have a club meeting today.

31
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,560
Well, bye.

32
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,660
- She turned you down again.

33
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,280
Hey, Peter, how many times was that?

34
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,740
- Come on, shut up.

35
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,740
As if one of you losers could actually score a date with her.

36
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:18,300
Oh my gosh, if I'm late with my deliveries, the manager's gonna be furious.

37
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Hey!

38
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,300
Hi!

39
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,300
Hi!

40
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,300
I'm home!

41
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
Boy, am I happy!

42
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,300
I'm home!

43
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
I'm home!

44
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
I'm home!

45
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,300
I'm home!

46
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,300
I'm home!

47
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,020
Hi, I'm home.

48
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,480
Boy, am I hungry.

49
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,100
Oh, my, the neighbors can probably hear you.

50
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,720
You are such a child.

51
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,460
Go and wash your hands, dear.

52
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,800
Yes, ma'am.

53
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:43,780
Huh?

54
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,060
Hey, Mom, you dyed your hair.

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,480
What do you think?

56
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,860
At your age?

57
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't think you should be dyeing your hair such a bright color.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,420
I don't agree with you, Dad.

59
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,760
I think Mom looks great.

60
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,280
Looks like she's going to some costume parade.

61
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,540
It's nice to know Mom is still young.

62
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,760
Right?

63
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,780
Hi, Dad.

64
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,800
Oh, and that reminds me.

65
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,960
Speaking of costumes,

66
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,700
I saw some kids dressed up from head to toe today.

67
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,820
Oh, yes.

68
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,560
Today's supposed to be the St. Hadrian Costume Parade.

69
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,020
Oh, I wish I had dressed up like that when I was a little girl.

70
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,780
They were so adorable.

71
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,500
Hmm?

72
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,840
Huh?

73
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,120
Yeah, you did dress up in a costume once.

74
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,700
Isn't that right, dear?

75
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,880
That's right.

76
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,900
I'd completely forgotten really let's see it's around here. Oh

77
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,740
Look here it is. You were so cute

78
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:49,720
Guess I did you were so excited and made such a fuss isn't that right dear, huh? Yeah, I remember

79
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:06,420
Hmm. A costume parade, huh?

80
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,760
Distant spring. I forlornly wait for a spring that will never come.

81
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,500
Hannah. Oh, Hannah. Will you get over your breakup already?

82
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:32,320
I shall send you the most beautiful flowers I was born to smother you with flowers that's so

83
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:45,540
beautiful Wow I wonder who sent this uh-huh I'm very impressed with you Peter so how have you

84
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:52,520
been, Nina? Well, I've been very well lately, Dr. Geidel. That's good to hear. But of course,

85
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,520
I could tell just by the look on your face when you came into this session that you were doing

86
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,700
well. So, tell me, are you still having that nightmare? The one about the monster emerging

87
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,240
from the darkness? No. I've been sleeping very well. I've been so busy, I don't have time to

88
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,520
dream. I wonder why I was plagued by such a dream night after night. It's common for students to

89
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
to feel fear and anxiety.

90
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,260
Expectations of the future mix up with other insecurities.

91
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,820
People end up confused, losing sight of who they are.

92
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,400
But who you are is something you can spend your whole life

93
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,300
trying to grasp and never figure out completely.

94
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,540
We're always projecting and trying to look into the future.

95
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,700
We spend our whole lives looking for the answers

96
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,400
and we do the best we can.

97
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
- Right, and that's what I'm doing.

98
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,580
I want to become a federal prosecutor.

99
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,140
- That's very good.

100
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,700
- All right, I think that brings us

101
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,000
to the end of our session.

102
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,860
- Bye, and thank you, Doctor.

103
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,700
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,540
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,820
- Nina Fortener, such a cheerful girl,

106
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,740
but I can't help thinking that she's overcompensating

107
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,260
or running from something,

108
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,460
something overwhelmingly dark.

109
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,220
- Huh?

110
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,960
- What do you mean, what?

111
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,600
- Don't act so innocent.

112
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,960
- What in the world are you going on about?

113
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,160
- I was born to smother you with flowers?

114
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,020
I would never have guessed in a million years

115
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,320
you had such talent for writing poetry.

116
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,820
- I don't know what you're talking about.

117
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,200
I wouldn't be able to come up with frilly stuff like that

118
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,900
even if I stood on my head.

119
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,640
- Then who was it?

120
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,100
I only give my email address to friends and no one else.

121
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,360
- Beats me.

122
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Damn it.

123
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,700
What this means is some suave poetry guy

124
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:53,140
honing in on my girl who then who could it be this was a bizarre murder that

125
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,320
took place in Munich after shooting the parents to death the perpetrators

126
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,820
strangled their two children with a rope grizzly really now I would like you to

127
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,000
explain the verdict using the records from all of the hearings nina fortner

128
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:22,960
hmm what do you not understand the question um no um well the trial was focused mainly

129
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,080
on the cold-blooded murder of an entire family

130
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,520
the evidence

131
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,140
the evidence

132
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,620
oh

133
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,980
so not even Nina has all the answers

134
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,480
huh

135
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:45,880
Nina

136
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,600
what's wrong Nina

137
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,520
Nina

138
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,840
are you alright

139
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,460
you want to go see the nurse

140
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:05,520
I... I'm all right. I just felt a little ill, that's all. I was just listening to the professor, and I...

141
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,620
Huh? You mean that question about that murdered family?

142
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,560
Don't say that!

143
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,440
Is that it? I thought you were awfully brave, but I guess you're pretty sensitive, too.

144
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,440
Did you watch a horror movie that totally scared you when you were a kid or something?

145
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,240
I know exactly what that counselor, Dr. Geidel, would say.

146
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:32,600
If you get back to the root of it, I think that you'll find it was nothing significant now go back to your childhood

147
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,200
Am I right?

148
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
That's it. Hmm. I

149
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,840
Have no memories, huh? I

150
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,500
Remember nothing before the age of 10

151
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:04,040
Where are my memories?

152
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,440
My childhood memories?

153
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,900
Yes, those two were indeed a very nice couple.

154
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,820
to think that they died in such a way.

155
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:27,800
Huh?

156
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,800
Children.

157
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,500
Oh.

158
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,540
Now that you mention it, yes, there was a son.

159
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,480
His name was Michael, I do believe.

160
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,520
He was there for a year or two.

161
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,760
Let's see, a boy.

162
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,660
Do you remember if there was a boy?

163
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,300
Yes, there was.

164
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,040
Wasn't his name Michael?

165
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,920
He was 14, give or take.

166
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,380
Michael, you say?

167
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,680
Yeah, I think I remember him.

168
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,480
But why?

169
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,200
Who are you, the police?

170
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,700
Yes, Michael Reitman.

171
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,660
I remember him vaguely, but he was a student in my classroom.

172
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,380
But he... he didn't leave much of an impression.

173
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,100
I'm embarrassed to say it, but honestly, I don't remember him very well.

174
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,720
I'm not sure if he had any friends.

175
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,080
You see, there are no records left from then.

176
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,740
Everything went up in a fire about six years ago now.

177
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,200
There definitely was a boy named Michael living here in Cone until six years ago.

178
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,400
And Michael's real name is...

179
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,880
Johan, huh? Yes, there was a time when I went by that name.

180
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,880
Who are you? What does it matter? What's the use? He's a serial killer,

181
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,480
an older of twin siblings. That's all there is to it. Nothing else.

182
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,800
What am I doing?

183
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Twins. His sister. Where did his twin sister go?

184
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:13,520
I will pick you up very soon. Who is this? He'll be picking me up very soon? But what does that mean?

185
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:25,800
a child oh yes there was a boy about seven or eight years ago so mr and mrs heiner had taken

186
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:32,500
a boy in before they were killed and what was he like what was he like that was quite a long time

187
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,500
ago and i think he only really lived with them for about a year or so i honestly don't remember

188
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,740
anything about him wait do you remember if this boy had a sister no only the boy

189
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,160
listen I just want to forget about what happened to that poor couple after all

190
00:13:48,160 --> 00:14:02,340
those horrible things happened I almost moved away I remember that boy very well

191
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:16,940
why don't you come up I was about to have some tea come in have a seat yes

192
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:23,720
thank you um I was wondering just have a seat

193
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:44,440
Go ahead, have some tea.

194
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,780
Thank you, sir.

195
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,780
You're a doctor, right?

196
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,920
That boy was the one who told me.

197
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,460
You are Dr. Tenma.

198
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,940
He's coming to pick you up?

199
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,880
Who is he? I have no idea who he is.

200
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,940
It was just an anonymous email.

201
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,440
Aw, you look so happy.

202
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,480
You're not thinking this is Prince Charming on a white charger

203
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,920
or a knight in shining armor coming for you, are you?

204
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,280
Why are you jealous?

205
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
There you go, Nina, daydreaming again.

206
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,820
It said I was born to smother you with flowers.

207
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,760
Come on, that's so corny.

208
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,720
How many boys do you know who write like that?

209
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,680
Oh, hold on, wait.

210
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,720
There is a new guy in our class.

211
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,820
You know who I'm talking about?

212
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,520
Oh, I've seen him.

213
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,360
He's the guy who sits quietly in that legendary seat in room 12

214
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,540
where you're bound to be called by the instructor.

215
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,040
But strangely enough, he's never called on.

216
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,180
That's right, and you want to know what else?

217
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,320
He is always staring at Nina the entire class.

218
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,120
He's the one!

219
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,180
What do you mean?

220
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,780
Come on, you know.

221
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,360
Prince Charming, who else?

222
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,920
All I know is that boy was extremely grateful to you.

223
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,320
Yes, Dr. Tenma.

224
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,960
He told me more than once that because you saved his life,

225
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,500
you meant more to him than his parents.

226
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,740
What name did he go by, then?

227
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,800
Franz.

228
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,080
But he did tell me it wasn't his real name.

229
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,480
If he opened up enough to tell you that much, it means he must have really trusted you.

230
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,380
He just showed up one day out of nowhere, really.

231
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,520
Mr. and Mrs. Heiner, who lived across the hall, took him in.

232
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,700
He lived with them for about a year.

233
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:53,200
No, actually, it was 14 months, to be precise, from March 1987 to April 1988.

234
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,840
And then one day, out of the blue, he suddenly vanished.

235
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,180
He really was very bright, that boy, and very well-mannered.

236
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,160
Did he visit you in your apartment very often?

237
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,700
Every day. I live alone, so I always welcome the company.

238
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,460
He sat in that chair and would spend most of his time studying.

239
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,740
He was able to master the English and French that I taught him in no time.

240
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,480
By the time he disappeared, he was completely fluent in both languages.

241
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,640
He was only 12 years old.

242
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,380
Can you tell me if there's anything else you remember about him? Anything?

243
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,140
He was always interested in listening to my stories.

244
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,840
And what kind of stories do you think he liked best? Go on, take a wild guess.

245
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:44,900
I...

246
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,920
He liked my war stories.

247
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,960
War stories?

248
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,880
During World War II, I was on the crew of a U-boat.

249
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:00,020
The boys' favorite story was about the time we were attacked by a destroyer of the Allied forces.

250
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,760
We were at a depth of 120 meters.

251
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,100
That's when we were attacked by the enemy.

252
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,640
We had suffered a mortal blow, but we just kept going.

253
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,160
We all waited in terror inside that creaking boat, enduring hour after hour.

254
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,400
We had to endure that hell for a day and a half

255
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,040
Any ordinary child would have probably looked at this as another adventure story

256
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,240
But that boy was different

257
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,880
What he was most interested in was my description of ultimate fear

258
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,560
Yes, ultimate fear

259
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,020
That reaction of people on the verge of death fascinated him

260
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,240
That was all he was interested in

261
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,740
He toyed with fear.

262
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,500
So what... what was the expression on his face as he listened?

263
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,580
He probably had a gleam in his eye and a smile, I imagine.

264
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,060
Imagine?

265
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,900
Well, I cannot see, Dr. Tenma.

266
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:14,000
So no, I don't know the boy's real name, nor obviously do I have any idea what he looks like for that matter.

267
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,740
earlier you suggested the boy trusted me because he told me France wasn't his

268
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,000
real name I can assure you that he doesn't trust anyone there's only one

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,300
person that boys trusted in his life and that's his sister listen I need your

270
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,880
help I'm looking for that sister he said he would go get her when she turned 20

271
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,140
Where is she?

272
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,720
In Heidelberg.

273
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,980
See you later.

274
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,720
Be careful on your scooter, honey.

275
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,220
I will.

276
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,020
Bye. See you later, Daddy.

277
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Bye. And drive safely, okay?

278
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,900
See you later.

279
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,220
The time has come, hasn't it?

280
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,520
I know.

281
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,320
We made an agreement.

282
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,420
We said we'd tell her on her 20th birthday

283
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,620
that... that she isn't our real daughter.

284
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,060
Hmm.

285
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,900
Hold on a second. I'm not sure I can do this.

286
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,680
What are you talking about? You wanted to meet him.

287
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,540
We told him you'd wait for him here.

288
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,840
It's better you didn't know.

289
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,040
Don't mess it up. You're about to meet Prince Charming. Later!

290
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,320
Wait! Clara! Beate!

291
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,540
How could they do this behind my back?

292
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,860
It's him!

293
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,880
Here we go.

294
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:11,340
Hi, how do you do? You're Nina Fortner, right?

295
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Uh, yes.

296
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,500
Oh, good, yeah. My name's Otto Huberman.

297
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,780
Oh, uh, hello.

298
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:48,060
Who? Who are you? I've seen that face somewhere before.

299
00:21:48,060 --> 00:22:02,240
Who? Who are you?

300
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Nina!

301
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
Nina!

302
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Nina!

303
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,840
What's wrong?

304
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Can you hear me?

305
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Wake up.

306
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Come on, Nina.

307
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Wake up.

308
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Please.

309
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
What happened?

310
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Come on.

311
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Hey, Nina.
