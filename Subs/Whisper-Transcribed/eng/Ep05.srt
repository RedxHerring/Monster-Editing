1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,520
Now, class, I want you to tell me what was the basis for the ruling the judge made in

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,440
regards to the 1968 Stuttgart case.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,920
Oh, boy, what is this silence?

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,000
Are we some kind of a monastery?

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,120
Mr. Imer, I'd like to hear your answer if you have one.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,820
Uh, well, sir, that is to say, I, uh...

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,940
Anyone. Is there anyone in this room who can break this silence?

8
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,640
So the chronic latecomer is here at last.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,180
13 minutes tardy.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,760
Seems your part-time pizza delivery job

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,220
kept you awfully busy today.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,120
- I'm sorry, Professor Kronecker.

13
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,880
- Well, let me ask you a question before you sit down.

14
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,700
Do you have enough strength left to tell me the basis

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,640
for the ruling in the 1968 Stuttgart case?

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,080
- Um, oh yes.

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,420
Well, the defense claimed that the kidnapping was a sham,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
death had been due to poisoning. After an investigation into the crime scene, it was

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,340
found that the victim's death had been accidental, and that there was no motive. So, since the

20
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,060
crime couldn't be proven to be an intentional murder, I believe a sentence of 15 years was

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,780
handed down." "Hmm. Very good. You can take your seat,

22
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,760
Nina Fortuna.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,700
Yes, Professor.

24
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,460
(dramatic music)

25
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,820
Wow, good job, Nina.

26
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,980
If no one had been able to give him the answer, I have no doubt that Kronika would have probably

27
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,380
I'll have to treat our savior, Nina, to something to eat.

28
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,460
What do you say, Nina? A nice meal, just the two of us?

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,960
Oh, I'm sorry, Peter, but I have a club meeting today.

30
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,360
Well, bye.

31
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,500
Aw.

32
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,740
She turned you down again.

33
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,200
Hey, Peter, how many times was that?

34
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,480
Come on, shut up.

35
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,300
As if one of you losers could actually score a date with her.

36
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,440
(Grunting)

37
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,200
(Grunting)

38
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,620
(grunting)

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,100
- Thank you.

40
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,340
- Oh my gosh, if I'm late with my deliveries,

41
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,880
the manager's gonna be furious.

42
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,100
(laughing)

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,760
- Hey!

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,780
- Hi!

45
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,020
Hi, I'm home.

46
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,480
Boy, am I hungry.

47
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,100
Oh, my, the neighbors can probably hear you.

48
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,720
You are such a child.

49
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,460
Go and wash your hands, dear.

50
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,800
Yes, ma'am.

51
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,780
Huh?

52
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,020
Hey, Mom, you dyed your hair.

53
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,480
What do you think?

54
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,860
At your age?

55
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't think you should be dyeing your hair

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
such a bright color.

57
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,440
I don't agree with you, Dad.

58
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,760
I think Mom looks great.

59
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,280
Looks like she's going to some costume parade.

60
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,540
It's nice to know Mom is still young.

61
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,500
Right, hi dad. Oh

62
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,680
And that reminds me speaking of costumes I saw some kids dressed up from head to toe today

63
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,500
Oh, yes. Today's supposed to be the st. Hadrian costume parade

64
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,840
Oh, I wish I had dressed up like that when I was a little girl. They were so adorable

65
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:29,260
Huh, yeah, you did dress up in a costume once isn't that right dear? That's right. I'd completely forgotten

66
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,920
it's around here oh look here it is you were so cute

67
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,420
guess I did you were so excited and made such a fuss isn't that right dear huh

68
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,440
Yeah, I remember

69
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,040
Costume parade

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,760
Distant spring I forlornly wait for a spring that will never come

71
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,500
Will you get over your break-up already?

72
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,280
I shall send you the most beautiful flowers.

73
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,400
I was born to smother you with flowers.

74
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,860
That's so beautiful.

75
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,800
Wow! I wonder who sent this.

76
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
I'm very impressed with you, Peter.

77
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,040
So, how have you been, Nina?

78
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,580
Well, I've been very well lately, Dr. Geidel.

79
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
That's good to hear.

80
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,600
But of course, I could tell just by the look on your face

81
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,880
when you came into this session that you were doing well.

82
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,120
So, tell me, are you still having that nightmare?

83
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,520
The one about the monster emerging from the darkness?

84
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,320
No. I've been sleeping very well.

85
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,520
I've been so busy, I don't have time to dream.

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,560
I wonder why I was plagued by such a dream night after night.

87
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,940
It's common for students to feel fear and anxiety.

88
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,520
Expectations of the future mix up with other insecurities.

89
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,220
People end up confused, losing sight of who they are.

90
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,140
But who you are is something you can spend your whole life trying to grasp

91
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,540
and never figure out completely.

92
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,980
We're always projecting and trying to look into the future.

93
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,000
We spend our whole lives looking for the answers and we do the best we can.

94
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,860
Right, and that's what I'm doing.

95
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,020
I want to become a federal prosecutor.

96
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,400
That's very good.

97
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,700
All right, I think that brings us to the end of our session.

98
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,660
Bye, and thank you, Doctor.

99
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,180
Mm-hmm.

100
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:50,920
Mm-hmm.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,860
Nina Fortner. Such a cheerful girl.

102
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,560
But I can't help thinking that she's overcompensating

103
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,960
or running from something.

104
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,140
Something overwhelmingly dark.

105
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,380
Huh?

106
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,680
What do you mean, "what"?

107
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,440
innocent what in the world are you going on about i was born to smother you with flowers

108
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,720
i would never have guessed in a million years you had such talent for writing poetry i don't know

109
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,660
what you're talking about i wouldn't be able to come up with frilly stuff like that even if i

110
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:37,340
stood on my head then who was it i only give my email address to friends and no one else beats

111
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:43,060
Damn it. What this means is some suave poetry guy is honing in on my girl.

112
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,140
Who then? Who could it be?

113
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,600
This was a bizarre murder that took place in Munich.

114
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,860
After shooting the parents to death, the perpetrator strangled their two children with a rope.

115
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,640
Grizzly, really?

116
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,680
Now, I would like you to explain the verdict.

117
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,380
using the records from all of the hearings.

118
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Nina Fortner.

119
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,200
What, do you not understand the question?

120
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,240
- Um, no.

121
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,980
Well, the trial was focused mainly

122
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,020
on the cold-blooded murder of an entire family.

123
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,500
The evidence.

124
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,100
The evidence.

125
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,960
- Oh, so not even Nina has all the answers,

126
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,420
Nina? What's wrong Nina? Nina?

127
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,440
Are you alright? You want to go see the nurse?

128
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:04,000
I... I'm alright. I just felt a little ill, that's all. I was just listening to the professor

129
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,540
and I...

130
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,680
about that murdered family?

131
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,620
Don't say that!

132
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,200
Is that it?

133
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,940
I thought you were awfully brave,

134
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,440
but I guess you're pretty sensitive too.

135
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,280
Did you watch a horror movie

136
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,440
that totally scared you when you were a kid or something?

137
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,860
I know exactly what that counselor,

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,200
Dr. Geidel, would say.

139
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,280
If you get back to the root of it,

140
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,240
I think that you'll find it was nothing significant.

141
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,520
Now go back to your childhood.

142
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,460
Am I right?

143
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,140
That's it.

144
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:42,740
Hmm, I have no memories, huh? I remember nothing before the age of 10

145
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,280
"Memories"

146
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,060
Where are my memories?

147
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,740
My childhood memories...

148
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,960
Yes, those two were indeed a very nice couple.

149
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,820
To think that they died in such a way.

150
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:27,800
Huh?

151
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,820
Children.

152
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,500
Oh.

153
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,540
Now that you mention it, yes, there was a son.

154
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,480
His name was Michael, I do believe.

155
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,540
He was there for a year or two.

156
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,760
Let's see, a boy.

157
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,660
Do you remember if there was a boy?

158
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,960
wasn't his name Michael he was 14 give or take Michael you say yeah I think I

159
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:58,100
remember him but why who are you the police yes Michael Reitman I remember

160
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,840
him vaguely but he was a student in my classroom but he he didn't leave much of

161
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,780
an impression I'm embarrassed to say it but honestly I don't remember him very

162
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:14,100
well. I'm not sure if he had any friends. You see, there are no records left from then.

163
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,800
Everything went up in a fire about six years ago now.

164
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:29,540
There definitely was a boy named Michael living here in Koln until six years ago. And Michael's

165
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,540
His real name is...

166
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,480
Johan, huh?

167
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,980
Yes, there was a time when I went by that name.

168
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,120
Who are you?

169
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,640
What does it matter? What's the use?

170
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,360
He's a serial killer. The elder of twin siblings.

171
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,640
That's all there is to it. Nothing else.

172
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,740
What am I doing?

173
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,900
Twins? His sister? Where did his twin sister go?

174
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,460
I will pick you up very soon. Who is this?

175
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,520
He'll be picking me up very soon? But what does that mean?

176
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,640
A child. Oh, yes. There was a boy about seven or eight years ago.

177
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,320
So, Mr. and Mrs. Haina had taken a boy in before they were killed.

178
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,040
And what was he like?

179
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,780
What was he like?

180
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,900
That was quite a long time ago.

181
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,600
And I think he only really lived with them for about a year or so.

182
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,520
I honestly don't remember anything about him.

183
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,240
Wait, do you remember if this boy had a sister?

184
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,900
No, only the boy.

185
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,500
Listen, I just want to forget about what happened to that poor couple.

186
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,880
After all those horrible things happened, I almost moved away.

187
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,320
I remember that boy very well.

188
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,360
Why don't you come up?

189
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,440
I was about to have some tea.

190
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,720
Come in.

191
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,340
Have a seat.

192
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,120
Uh, yes.

193
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,020
Thank you.

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,780
Um, I was wondering...

195
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,920
Just have a seat.

196
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,380
Go ahead, have some tea.

197
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,060
Thank you, sir

198
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:06,540
You're a doctor right that boy was the one who told me you are dr. Tenma

199
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:16,260
He's coming to pick you up who is he I have no idea who he is it was just an anonymous email oh

200
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,460
Aw, you look so happy.

201
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,480
You're not thinking this is Prince Charming on a white charger

202
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,920
or a knight in shining armor coming for you, are you?

203
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,300
Why are you jealous?

204
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,040
There you go, Nina, daydreaming again.

205
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,820
It said I was born to smother you with flowers.

206
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,760
Come on, that's so corny.

207
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,740
How many boys do you know who write like that?

208
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,700
Oh, hold on, wait.

209
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,720
There is a new guy in our class.

210
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,800
You know who I'm talking about?

211
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,520
Oh, I've seen him.

212
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,020
in that legendary seat in room 12 where you're bound to be called by the

213
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,260
instructor but strangely enough he's never called on that's right and you

214
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:59,560
want to know what else he is always staring at Nina the entire class he's

215
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,440
the one what do you mean come on you know it's charming who else

216
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,640
all I know is that boy was extremely grateful to you yes dr. Tenma he told me

217
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,540
You saved his life. You meant more to him than his parents.

218
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,760
What name did he go by then?

219
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,080
Franz. But he did tell me it wasn't his real name.

220
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,440
If he opened up enough to tell you that much, it means he must have really trusted you.

221
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,380
He just showed up one day out of nowhere, really.

222
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,500
Mr. and Mrs. Heine, who lived across the hall, took him in.

223
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,660
He lived with them for about a year.

224
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:53,200
No. Actually, it was 14 months, to be precise, from March 1987 to April 1988.

225
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,840
Then one day, out of the blue, he suddenly vanished.

226
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,180
He really was very bright, that boy, and very well-mannered.

227
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,160
Did he visit you in your apartment very often?

228
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,700
Every day. I live alone, so I always welcome the company.

229
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,480
He sat in that chair and would spend most of his time studying.

230
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,740
He was able to master the English and French that I taught him in no time.

231
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,440
By the time he disappeared, he was completely fluent in both languages.

232
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,640
He was only twelve years old.

233
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,400
Can you tell me if there's anything else you remember about him? Anything?

234
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,200
He was always interested in listening to my stories.

235
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,860
What stories do you think he liked best? Go on, take a wild guess.

236
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,820
I...

237
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,920
He liked my war stories.

238
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,900
War stories?

239
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,880
During World War II, I was on the crew of a U-boat.

240
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:00,080
The boy's favorite story was about the time we were attacked by a destroyer of the Allied forces.

241
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,840
We were at a depth of a hundred and twenty meters.

242
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,100
That's when we were attacked by the enemy.

243
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,640
We had suffered a mortal blow, but we just kept going.

244
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,020
We all waited in terror inside that creaking boat,

245
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,140
enduring hour after hour.

246
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,400
We had to endure that hell for a day and a half.

247
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,380
Any ordinary child would have probably looked at this

248
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,220
as another adventure story, but that boy was different.

249
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,960
What he was most interested in was my description

250
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,840
of ultimate fear.

251
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,540
Yes, ultimate fear.

252
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,980
That reaction of people on the verge of death fascinated him.

253
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,180
That was all he was interested in.

254
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,740
He toyed with fear.

255
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,640
So what...

256
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,500
What was the expression on his face as he listened?

257
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,580
He probably had a gleam in his eye and a smile, I imagine.

258
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,060
Imagine?

259
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,880
Well, I cannot see, Dr. Tenma.

260
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:13,100
So, no. I don't know the boy's real name, nor obviously do I have any idea what he looks

261
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,200
like for that matter. Earlier, you suggested the boy trusted me because he told me France

262
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,160
wasn't his real name. I can assure you that he doesn't trust anyone. There's only one

263
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,260
person that boy's trusted in his life, and that's his sister.

264
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Listen, I need your help. I'm looking for that sister.

265
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,940
- He said he would go get her when she turned 20.

266
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,740
- Where is she?

267
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,660
- In Heidelberg.

- Be careful on your scooter, honey.

271
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,480
- I will.

272
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,600
Bye. See you later, Daddy.

273
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,880
- Bye. And drive safely, okay?

274
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,440

- The time has come, hasn't it?

- I know.

279
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,620
- We made an agreement.

280
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,640
We said we'd tell her on her 20th birthday

281
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,220
that she isn't our real daughter.

00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,240
- What are you talking about?

285
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,380
You wanted to meet him.

286
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,540
Here, it's better you didn't know.

287
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
- Don't mess it up.

288
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,400
You're about to meet Prince Charming.

289
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,040

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,500
Wait, Clara, wait for me!

291
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,560
How could they do this behind my back?

292
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,860
It's him!

Oh, good. Yeah.

- Nina, come on.
