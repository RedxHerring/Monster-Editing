1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,520
Our brother has answered his call and gone home to the heavens.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,560
What lies here in this casket

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,580
is nothing more than the physical shell of Richard Brown.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,940
We know his soul has been set free.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,980
It will go on and live forever.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,120
Let us embrace his memory,

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,020
remembering that wherever his family will be,

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
this loving father and hard-working husband

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,040
will always be there in spirit.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,900
After he had risen from the dead,

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,380
It doesn't make any sense.

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,040
He just left so much unfinished.

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,380
I'm shocked that no one from the police force is here.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,140
Richard was an excellent detective,

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,320
but not one of them came to pay their respects.

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,940
It's ironic about him.

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,140
Drinking on duty cost him his career,

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,680
and in the end, a drunken fall is what cost him his life.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
At least, that's what the police report said.

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,240
His voice was so alive when he called.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,620
He was very excited about seeing his daughter,

22
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,180
but he never quite made it.

23
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,580
The Holy Spirit has planted in each of us a seed of immortality.

24
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,780
I asked myself, "Did I really do everything I could to help poor Richard?"

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,360
Why, of course you did, Doctor.

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,500
I just sat there listening to him spill out his life to me,

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,540
and I told him he was well on his way to making a full recovery.

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,860
I was wrong. I feel like I never did enough to help him.

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,040
Tenma is the key.

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,440
If we could question him, we might get the answers to help us solve all of this.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,020
I do believe you're right.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,140
I think there's something we both know, Doctor.

33
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,280
This wasn't an accident or a suicide.

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,740
As you said, a few hours before his death, Richard was on the phone happily talking to his daughter.

35
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,640
He wanted to see her.

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,220
Doctor, you did all that you could and you had helped him.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,080
Richard had quit drinking and was on the road to recovery.

38
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,300
"Whatever happened, it wasn't your fault."

39
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,960
(dramatic music)

40
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,520
(panting)

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,760
Listen to this. You aren't going to believe it.

42
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,260
I'm serious. I found out my husband's having an affair.

43
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,740
So I confronted him, and now he won't even speak to me.

44
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,580
He just washes the car, cleans the garage, and gives me the silent treatment.

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,480
I know he's avoiding me. It's so obvious.

46
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,140
I wait up for him to come to bed, but he falls asleep in his chair.

47
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,400
Besides being blonde and beautiful, what's she got that I don't?

48
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,520
Doctor, are you listening to me?

49
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,480
Uh, of course. Please, continue.

50
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,260
Now here's the part you were just not going to believe.

51
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,240
I decided to confront this other woman, so I go over to her place, and what do you think she said to me?

52
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,240
A homicide? No, not a chance, Doc. It was an unlucky accident.

53
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,440
Richard Brown was alone that evening when he went up to the roof of building number 12 at Munich University.

54
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,840
He polished off a bottle of whiskey, and he got so drunk he fell off the roof.

55
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,760
End of story.

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,860
The bottle. Did you have it thoroughly examined?

57
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,120
Yes, of course we did, and we found Richard's prints on it.

58
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,740
If you don't mind, could I see that bottle?

59
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,660
Why, yeah, sure, I suppose. But it's all in pieces.

60
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,820
Oh, Richard.

61
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,140
(heavy breathing)

62
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,740
- I think there's something we both know, Doctor.

63
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,480
As you said, a few hours before his death,

64
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,080
Richard was on the phone, happily talking to his daughter.

65
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,500
He wanted to see her.

66
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,800
(eerie music)

67
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,880
Him? Yeah. The guy in this picture was definitely in here that night.

68
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,940
Was he alone? I'm not sure. I really don't remember.

69
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,920
So you remember that he was here, but you don't recall if he was here with someone or

70
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,020
alone. It was him. He had a cup of coffee.

71
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,240
- Coffee, eh?

72
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,260
- Yeah, that's the reason I remember him.

73
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,840
Most folks order drinks with alcohol when they come here.

74
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,060
- So tell me, is there a chance this young man

75
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,140
was with him that night?

76
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,640
- I really couldn't tell ya.

77
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,980
- You're not even trying.

78
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,300
- Look, I told ya, I don't know.

79
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,880
We got tons of customers who come into this place, mister.

80
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,300
But, like I told the cops,

81
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,840
I think the coffee guy did buy a bottle of whiskey.

82
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,900
I got a receipt.

83
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,720
Are you sure it was Richard who bought that bottle?

84
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,600
I told you, I don't remember.

85
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,320
All I know for sure is on that receipt there's a cheap bottle of whiskey.

86
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,460
Wait, what did you just say?

87
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,400
Like this one, a fifth of blended whiskey.

88
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,980
I can't believe it.

89
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,820
Why didn't it hit me when I saw that bottle at the police station?

90
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,580
Hmm?

91
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,380
Have you been drinking again?

92
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,160
Well, um, just a little.

93
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,540
So what do you drink?

94
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,360
Scotch. I only drink scotch.

95
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,120
Hmm. So you're stinking up my entire office with the smell of cheap booze.

96
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,620
Cheap booze? You kidding me?

97
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:24,000
I'd never drink cheap rocket if I'm going to drink. It's real scotch or nothing else

98
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,800
Richard didn't buy that bottle of whiskey

99
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,200
Johan

100
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
It must have been him.

101
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,980
Hey! Hey, you!

102
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,700
Stop running!

103
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,840
[PANTING]

104
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,200
[GROANING]

105
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,920

[CHATTER]

107
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,420
Oh, well, you know--

[CHATTER]

109
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,100
(people chattering)

110
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,840
- Hey.

111
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,140
- Hey, what do you want?

112
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,700
- Why'd you just try to push me onto the tracks?

113
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,320
- What the?

114
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

115
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,500
- Out with it.

116
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,140
- Hey there, old man.

117
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,080
You got a problem with my friend?

118
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,140
Bad idea.

119
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,020
(grunting)

120
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,860
Who told you to push me?

121
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,580
You need to shut up. At your age, old man, you should be at home playing with your grandkids.

122
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,940
Hey! I still want an answer!

123
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,280
(grunting)

124
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,940
- Hold it!

125
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,960
You know, I trained as a border patrol officer.

126
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,860
- It really hurts.

127
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,280
- Speak up, why'd you try to push me earlier?

128
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,160
- I, I don't know.

129
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,940
- Don't you dare try to pull one over on me.

130
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,120
- Somebody asked me to do it.

131
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,980
- Who was it?

132
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,280
- It was some big guy.

133
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,140
What do you mean, a big guy?

134
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,580
A guy I met in the subway paid me

135
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,740
to push you off the platform and onto the tracks.

136
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,600
He gave me money to do it!

137
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:21,960
Really?

138
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,720
Oh!

139
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,340
Oh!

140
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,500
Oh!

141
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,400
Oh!

142
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:29,540
Oh!

143
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh!

144
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,040
Oh!

145
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,680
Oh!

146
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,440
I brought you scotch, single malt, the really good stuff you liked.

147
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,740
You deserve it, my friend.

148
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,960
It's okay.

149
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,760
You can have a drink now.

150
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,160
You can count on me, Richard.

151
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,100
As God is my witness,

152
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,740
I'll identify the guy who did this.

153
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,300
I swear it.

154
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,620
I'll uncover Johan's true identity.

155
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,920
So listen to this, Doctor. I finally told my husband what I think.

156
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,040
I said that his cheating on me is a disease that's festering inside him.

157
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,280
Then I told that ape that he's the one who should be sitting here and counting.

158
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,280
It's like, not me.

159
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,000
Doctor, did you hear what I said?

160
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,720
- Hmm?

161
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,640
Why, yes, I did.

162
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,680
Go ahead.

163
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
- Well, then tell me.

164
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,080
If my husband keeps this up,

165
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,680
I feel like my depression's only going to get worse,

166
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,240
isn't it?

167
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,300
- Well, no.

168
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,480
I don't believe you're really clinically depressed at all.

169
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,480
- Huh?

170
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,480
- Honestly, I'm more concerned about your husband's actions

171
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,000
than I am with your mental state.

172
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,940
We must find out why he's giving you the silent treatment.

173
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,520
The Big Lug doesn't know which end is up.

174
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,660
Please, Doctor, I beg of you.

175
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,860
Please make some time to see my husband.

176
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,040
Of course I will.

177
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,200
I have a slot open the day after tomorrow

178
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,760
at five o'clock in the afternoon.

179
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,340
All right?

180
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,800
Thank you. I'll tell him tonight.

181
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,220
Make sure you give that cheating jerk

182
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,460
a good talking to, Doctor.

183
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,420
Don't hold back. You got that?

184
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,080
Doctor, that was the last of your appointments for today.

185
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,380
Good. Thank you very much, Merith. See you tomorrow, then.

186
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,200
All right, then. Good night.

187
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,980
Oh, and there's one more thing.

188
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,700
Yesterday you forgot to lock the stairwell door to our office again.

189
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,620
Wait, I did it again? I'm sorry. I almost forgot today, too.

190
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,020
I can't believe it!

191
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,280
Have a nice evening.

192
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,080
(beeping)

193
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,400
(phone ringing)

194
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,740
- Hello, Dr. Gillen?

195
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,100
It's Dr. Reichwein.

196
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,940
I saw today's paper.

197
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,680
Why yes, I saw your newspaper ad in there.

198
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,020
Let's talk about our memories of cheating, Rudy.

199
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,800
So you really think if Dr. Tenma sees this message

200
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Get in touch with us?

201
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,040
- Absolutely.

202
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,300
If Dr. Temma sees the ad, he'll definitely contact me.

203
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,980
I worded it so it would be something

204
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,840
that only he and I would know about.

205
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,840
- I see.

206
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,860
- Now, doctor, please,

207
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,180
don't make any moves until we hear from him.

208
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,460
- Understood.

209
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,800
But there's still one related matter

210
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,960
that I need to investigate.

211
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,400
- What's that?

212
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,100
- This prostitute who pretended to be Margot Langer

213
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,360
just might have answers.

214
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,300
I'm following up on something Richard said.

215
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,880
- That prostitute told me that when foreign,

216
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,440
The man who killed himself went to see her. He had a young man accompanying him.

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,340
He was a young, beautiful guy with blonde hair.

218
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,700
Whatever you do, please be careful.

219
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,280
Oh, I will. If I want to get to the bottom of this, I'll have to be very cautious.

220
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,320
But Richard's memory deserves no less.

221
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,420
Well, I'll call you later, Doctor.

222
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,500
(wind howling)

223
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,820
- Oh, no.

224
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,540
So, Amerith, today you forget to shut the window.

225
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,720
(men laughing)

226
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,040
- Margot Langerholt, never heard of her.

227
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,020
- Well, I understand she goes by the name of Sophie

228
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,400
or something like that.

229
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,360
- Oh, yeah, so you want that fat old hat?

230
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,400
Is that what floats your boat, Gramps?

231
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,780
Oh, you're blushing fine make a ride two blocks down the brick building second floor

232
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,960
Thank you young lady, but I know she's not there right now

233
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,380
Huh? I haven't seen her around in about a week. She probably went to someplace. That's nicer and

234
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,780
Where might that be? Who the hell knows what makes that fat old hag so popular with all you guys?

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,360
My guess is she's with this really rich guy. He used to be a regular customer. You think she went with him?

236
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,160
Hey, what do you say you give me a try old man?

237
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,300
You must have money, and I'm sure I'm more fun than her.

238
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,760
Do you know where she went?

239
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,940
How would I know?

240
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,360
Maybe she went off somewhere with that new customer of hers.

241
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,220
So she has a new client, eh?

242
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,180
Uh-huh.

243
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,980
She should know better at her age than to fall for a guy like him.

244
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,460
He was a large one.

245
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,020
So he was a big man.

246
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,720
Oh yeah, and I heard he was pretty big downstairs, too.

247
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,820
Doctor, excuse me.

248
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,860
if it would be all right for me to leave early today?

249
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,240
- Yes, I remember that.

250
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,100
You said you needed to leave at five.

251
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,300
That'll be fine.

252
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,080
The only appointment I have left today

253
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,320
is Mrs. Hess's husband.

254
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,540
Are you going on a date, Merith?

255
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,180
- Oh, don't be silly, Doctor.

256
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,500
- Please make sure you lock all the doors.

257
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,400
I need to find that prostitute called Sophie

258
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,200
who was pretending to be Margot Langer

259
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
and show her this photo.

260
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,900
If I can get her to confirm that this Johan was actually with Farren,

261
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,260
I'll have someone who can testify to that fact,

262
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,100
which would bring me closer to getting to the bottom of this mess.

263
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,200
Yes?

264
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Yeah, my wife booked a session for me. Last name's Hess.

265
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,780
I buzzed the door. Please come in.

266
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,760
I might have better luck tonight if I go down there and look for Sophie again.

267
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,680
It's worth a shot.

268
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,560
Good evening, Dr. Reichlein.

269
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,420
Mr. Hess. Ah, welcome.

270
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,360
It's, uh, nice to meet you.

271
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,840
Please, sit down.

272
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,920
I, uh, this is my first time in counseling, so...

273
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,880
Well, there's nothing to be nervous about.

274
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,860
All you need to do is relax.

275
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,780
We're here to talk about whatever you want.

276
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,520
You can rest assured that our conversation will be completely confidential.

277
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,560
What we talk about stays right here.

278
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,680
You won't tell my wife?

279
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,780
Of course not.

280
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,080
How have you been feeling lately, and what is it you worry about?

281
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,280
My worries?

282
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,680
Yes, yours.

283
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,660
Well, my wife, she found out about my affair.

284
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,020
And your feeling?

285
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,960
I feel like I'm a stranger in my own home.

286
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,780
I just wash the car and clean up the garage.

287
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,660
That's all I do every day.

288
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,520
Does doing things around the house make you feel better?

289
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,400
Not really. And it seems like I hardly ever talk to my wife anymore.

290
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,560
Do you want to talk to her, but can't find a way to?

291
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,920
Well, I... I don't know about that.

292
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,720
Well, what about the mistress?

293
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,940
What?

294
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,560
You know, the woman you had an affair with. Have you two...

295
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,740
Yeah. I guess so. I killed her.

296
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,540
Hmm?

297
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,400
Well, I mean I had a dream where I killed her.

298
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,840
So how often would you say you have those kinds of dreams?

299
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,440
Oh, not often. Just once. I really don't have many dreams, Doc.

300
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,940
Guess I did it 'cause I was lonely.

301
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,960
Is that the reason you chose to have an affair?

302
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,720
No. It happened after I met him.

303
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,260
Met who?

304
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,780
I met this really beautiful young man with blonde hair.

305
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,080
Before he showed up, I felt like I was living underwater.

306
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,000
No matter how many people I killed, even after the wall fell, it was as if I was in a dream.

307
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,720
After that, everything was a lot more real.

308
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,820
I didn't feel like I was all alone anymore.

309
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,680
Uh, would you like some hot tea, perhaps?

310
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,120
No, thank you. I'm fine.

311
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,400
Well, I could use some. I'm feeling a bit thirsty.

312
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,340
You can just wait here.

313
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,800
My secretary's already gone home.

314
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:35,520
for the day. She has a date. She really knows how to brew tea. It's too bad she's not here

315
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:49,780
to make it for us. Hey Doc. Yes? What is it? I figure your job's gotta be pretty tough.

316
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,400
I mean, there's a lot of pressure.

317
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,780
People telling you all about their dreams and secrets.

318
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,780
Including ones that you probably don't want to know about.

319
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,560
You know, ones that could get you into trouble.

320
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,100
Like mine.

321
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,440
I mean, now you have to walk around knowing I'm a hitman.

322
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,040
So, anyhow, if you want to make amends towards your wife...

323
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,360
You... you need to start talking with her.

324
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,280
I hope you forgot to lock that damn door, Merith!
