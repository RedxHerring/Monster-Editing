1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
our brother has answered his call and gone home to the heavens what lies here in this casket is

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,560
nothing more than the physical shell of richard brown we know his soul has been set free it will

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,020
go on and live forever let us embrace his memory remembering that wherever his family will be

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,000
this loving father and hard-working husband will always be there in spirit

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,400
after he had risen from the dead the lord said it doesn't make any sense

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:36,420
he just left so much unfinished i'm shocked that no one from the police force is here

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,340
richard was an excellent detective but not one of them came to pay their respects

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,640
it's ironic about him drinking on duty cost him his career and in the end a drunken fall is what

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,240
cost him his life at least that's what the police report said his voice was so alive when he called

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,300
He was very excited about seeing his daughter, but he never quite made it.

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,560
But his spirit has planted in each of us a seed of immortality.

12
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,420
I asked myself, did I really do everything I could to help poor Richard?

13
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,380
Why, of course you did, Doctor.

14
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,500
I just sat there listening to him spill out his life to me,

15
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,540
and I told him he was well on his way to making a full recovery.

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,840
I was wrong. I feel like I never did enough to help him.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,060
Tenma is the key

18
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,460
If we could question him, we might get the answers to help us solve all of this

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,020
I do believe you're right

20
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,140
I think there's something we both know, Doctor

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,300
This wasn't an accident, or a suicide

22
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,760
As you said, a few hours before his death, Richard was on the phone happily talking to his daughter

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,780
He wanted to see her

24
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,240
Doctor, you did all that you could and you had helped him

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,120
Richard had quit drinking and was on the road to recovery.

26
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,420
Whatever happened, it wasn't your fault.

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:49,220
We'll be right back.

You aren't going to believe it.

34
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,560
I'm serious.

35
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,260
I found out my husband's having an affair,

36
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,720
so I confronted him, and now he won't even speak to me.

37
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,120
He just washes the car, cleans the garage,

38
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,580
and gives me the silent treatment.

39
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,420
I know he's avoiding me.

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,480
It's so obvious.

41
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,700
I wait up for him to come to bed,

42
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,140
but he falls asleep in his chair.

43
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,880
Besides being blonde and beautiful,

44
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,420
what's she got that I don't?

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:03,920
Huh?

46
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,500
Doctor, are you listening to me?

47
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,140
Uh, of course.

48
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,480
Please, continue.

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,260
Now, here's the part you were just not going to believe.

50
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,280
I decided to confront this other woman,

51
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,660
so I go over to her place,

52
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,280
and what do you think she said to me?

53
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,960
A homicide?

54
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,000
No, not a chance, Doc.

55
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,240
It was an unlucky accident.

56
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,440
Richard Brown was alone that evening when he went up to the roof of building number 12 at Munich University.

57
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,840
He polished off a bottle of whiskey, and he got so drunk he fell off the roof.

58
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,740
End of story.

59
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,600
The bottle.

60
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,860
Did you have it thoroughly examined?

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,060
Yes.

62
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,120
Of course we did, and we found Richard's prints on it.

63
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,740
If you don't mind, could I see that bottle?

64
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,920
Why, yeah, sure, I suppose.

65
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,640
But it's all in pieces.

66
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,780
Oh, Richard.

67
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,740
I think there's something we both know, Doctor.

68
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,480
As you said, a few hours before his death,

69
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
Richard was on the phone happily talking to his daughter.

70
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,500
He wanted to see her.

71
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:51,020
him yeah the guy in this picture was definitely in here that night was he alone i'm not sure i

72
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,080
really don't remember so you remember that he was here but you don't recall if he was here

73
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,180
with someone or alone it was him he had a cup of coffee coffee yeah that's the

74
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,860
reason I remember him most folks ordered drinks with alcohol when they come here

75
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:16,000
so tell me is there a chance this young man was with him that night I really

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,140
couldn't tell you you're not even trying look I told you I don't know we got tons

77
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,040
of customers who come into this place mister but like I told the cops I think

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,160
the coffee guy did buy a bottle of whiskey I got a receipt are you sure it

79
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,820
was Richard who bought that bottle I told you I don't remember all I know for

80
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,140
sure is on that receipt there's a cheap bottle of whiskey wait what did you just

81
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,380
say

82
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:47,420
Like this one, a fifth of blended whiskey.

83
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,980
I can't believe it.

84
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,800
Why didn't it hit me when I saw that bottle at the police station?

85
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,380
Have you been drinking again?

86
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,160
Well, um, just a little.

87
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,560
So what do you drink?

88
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,360
Scotch. I only drink scotch.

89
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,120
Hmm. So you're stinking up my entire office with the smell of cheap booze.

90
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,600
Cheap booze? You kidding me?

91
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,180
I'd never drink cheap rotgut if I'm going to drink its real scotch.

92
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,760
Or nothing else.

93
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,780
Richard didn't buy that bottle of whiskey.

94
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:49,660
Johan, it must have been him.

95
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,760
Hey, hey you! Stop running!

96
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:37,280
Oh, well, you know what?

97
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:56,160
Hey, what do you want?

98
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,680
Why'd you just try to push me onto the tracks?

99
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,860
What the... I don't know what you're talking about.

100
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,520
Get out with it!

101
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,140
Hey there, old man.

102
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,080
You got a problem with my friend?

103
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,140
Bad idea.

104
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:26,840
Who told you to push me?

105
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,480
You need to shut up.

106
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,560
At your age, old man, you should be at home playing with your grandkids.

107
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,380
- Hey, I still want an answer.

108
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,380
- Huh?

109
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,380
- Hold it!

110
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,380
You know, I trained as a border patrol officer.

111
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,380
- It really hurts.

112
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,380
- Speak up. Why'd you try to push me earlier?

113
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,380
- I... I don't know.

114
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,380
- Don't you dare try to pull one over on me!

115
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,380
- S-somebody asked me to do it.

116
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,380
- Who was it?

117
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,220
- Who was it?

118
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,500
- It was some big guy.

119
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,740
- What do you mean, a big guy?

120
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,620
- A guy I met in the subway paid me

121
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,200
to push you off the platform and onto the tracks.

122
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,740
He gave me money to do it.

123
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,500

You can count on me, Richard.

132
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,460
As God is my witness, I'll identify the guy who did this.

133
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,260
I swear it.

134
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,100
I'll uncover Johan's true identity.

135
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,900
So listen to this, Doctor.

136
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,240
- I finally told my husband what I think.

137
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,660
I said that his cheating on me is a disease

138
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,180
that's festering inside him.

139
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,100
Then I told that ape that he's the one

140
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,580
who should be sitting here and counseling, not me.

141
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,520
Doctor, did you hear what I said?

142
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,360
- Hmm?

143
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,200
Why, yes, I did.

144
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,280
Go ahead.

145
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,500
- Well, then tell me.

146
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,180
If my husband keeps this up,

147
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,740
I feel like my depression's only going to get worse,

148
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
isn't it?

149
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,000
- Well, no.

150
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,500
I don't believe you're really clinically depressed at all.

151
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,420
Huh?

152
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,480
Honestly, I'm more concerned about your husband's actions

153
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,000
than I am with your mental state.

154
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,940
We must find out why he's giving you the silent treatment.

155
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,300
That's what I think.

156
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,520
The big lug doesn't know which end is up.

157
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,660
Please, doctor, I beg of you.

158
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,860
Please make some time to see my husband.

159
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,020
Of course I will.

160
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,200
I have a slot open the day after tomorrow

161
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,340
at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, all right?

162
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,800
Thank you. I'll tell him tonight.

163
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,480
Make sure you give that cheating jerk a good talking to, Doctor

164
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Don't hold back, you got that?

165
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:23,080
Doctor, that was the last of your appointments for today

166
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,240
Good, thank you very much, Merith

167
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,440
See you tomorrow, then

168
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,200
All right, then. Good night.

169
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,980
Oh, and there's one more thing.

170
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,580
Yesterday, you forgot to lock the stairwell door

171
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,680
to our office again.

172
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,240
Wait, I did it again?

173
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,620
I'm sorry. I almost forgot today, too.

174
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,000
I can't believe it.

175
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,280
Have a nice evening.

176
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,720
Hello? Dr. Gillen?

177
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,100
It's Dr. Reichwein.

178
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,940
I saw today's paper.

179
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,680
Why, yes, I saw your newspaper ad in there.

180
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,020
Let's talk about our memories of cheating, Rudy.

181
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,360
So you really think if Dr. Tenma sees this message in the paper

182
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,240
that he will try to get in touch with us?

183
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:14,980
Absolutely.

184
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,300
If Dr. Tenma sees the ad, he'll definitely contact me.

185
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,840
I worded it so it would be something that only he and I would know about.

186
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,840
I see.

187
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,320
now doctor please don't make any moves until we hear from him understood but

188
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,000
there's still one related matter that I need to investigate what's that this

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,160
prostitute who pretended to be Margot Langer just might have answers I'm

190
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,720
following up on something Richard said that prostitute told me that went far

191
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,120
and the boy who killed himself went to see her he had a young man accompanying

192
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,300
him he was a young beautiful guy with blonde hair whatever you do please be

193
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,720
careful oh I will if I want to get to the bottom of this I'll have to be very

194
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:07,500
cautious but Richards memory deserves no less well I'll call you later doctor

195
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,820
Oh, no.

196
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,580
So, Merith, today you forget to shut the window.

197
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,500
Margot Langer, huh?

198
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,040
Never heard of her.

199
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,400
Well, I understand she goes by the name of Sophie or something like that.

200
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,260
Oh, yeah.

201
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,360
So you want that fat old hat?

202
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,400
Is that what floats your boat, Gramps?

203
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,160
No, wait.

204
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,440
It's not like that.

205
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,840
Oh, you're blushing.

206
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,740
Fine, make a ride two blocks down the brick building, second floor.

207
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,000
Thank you, young lady.

208
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,920
But I know she's not there right now.

209
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,420
Huh?

210
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,640
I haven't seen her around in about a week.

211
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,080
She probably went to someplace that's nicer.

212
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,220
And where might that be?

213
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,620
Who the hell knows?

214
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,780
What makes that fat old hag so popular with all you guys?

215
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,900
My guess is she's with this really rich guy who used to be a regular customer.

216
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,320
You think she went with him?

217
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,140
Hey, what do you say you give me a try, old man?

218
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,300
You must have money, and I'm sure I'm more fun than her.

219
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,760
Do you know where she went?

220
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,940
How would I know?

221
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,360
Maybe she went off somewhere with that new customer of hers.

222
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,220
So she has a new client, eh?

223
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,220
Uh-huh.

224
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,980
She should know better at her age than to fall for a guy like him.

225
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,440
He was a large one.

226
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,020
So he was a big man.

227
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,700
Oh, yeah, and I heard he was pretty big downstairs, too.

228
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,820
Doctor, excuse me.

229
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,860
Do you remember me asking you if it would be all right for me to leave early today?

230
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,240
Yes, I remember that.

231
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,100
You said you needed to leave at five.

232
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,300
That'll be fine.

233
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,320
The only appointment I have left today is Mrs. Hess's husband.

234
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,420
Are you going on a date, Meredith?

235
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,160
Oh, don't be silly, Doctor.

236
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,500
Please make sure you lock all the doors.

237
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,200
I need to find that prostitute called Sophie who was pretending to be Margot Langer

238
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,780
and show her this photo.

239
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,900
If I can get her to confirm that this Johan was actually with Farin,

240
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,260
I'll have someone who can testify to that fact,

241
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,080
which would bring me closer to getting to the bottom of this mess.

242
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,460
Yes?

243
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,900
Yeah, my wife booked a session for me. Last name's Hess.

244
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,780
I buzzed the door. Please come in.

245
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,760
I might have better luck tonight if I go down there and look for Sophie again.

246
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,700
It's worth a shot.

247
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:48,780
uh good evening dr reichlein mr hess ah welcome it's uh nice to meet you please sit down i uh

248
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,900
this is my first time in counseling so well there's nothing to be nervous about

249
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:59,260
all you need to do is relax we're here to talk about whatever you want you can rest assured that

250
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:05,120
our conversation will be completely confidential what we talk about stays right here you won't tell

251
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:12,620
my wife of course not how have you been feeling lately and what is it you worry

252
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:22,640
about my worries yes yours well my wife she found out about my affair and your

253
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,220
feeling I feel like I'm a stranger in my own home I just washed the car and clean

254
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,800
up the garage that's all I do every day does doing things around the house make

255
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,260
You feel better?

256
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,540
- Not really.

257
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,040
And it seems like I hardly ever talk to my wife anymore.

258
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,280
- Do you want to talk to her, but can't find a way to?

259
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,380
- Well, I don't know about that.

260
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,680
- Well, what about the mistress?

261
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,880
- What?

262
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,920
- You know, the woman you had an affair with.

263
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,760
Have you two--

264
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,260
- Yeah.

265
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,280
I guess so, I killed her.

266
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,760
- Hmm?

267
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,060
- Well, I mean I had a dream where I killed her.

268
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,400
- So how often would you say

269
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,640
you have those kinds of dreams?

270
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,620
- Oh, not often, just once.

271
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,740
I really don't have many dreams, Doc.

272
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,340
- Guess I did it 'cause I was lonely.

273
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,460
- Is that the reason you chose to have an affair?

274
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,780
- No, it happened after I met him.

275
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,860
- Met who?

276
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,120
- I met this really beautiful young man with blonde hair.

277
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,100
Before he showed up, I felt like I was living underwater.

278
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,000
No matter how many people I killed, even after the wall fell, it was as if I was in a dream.

279
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,720
After that, everything was a lot more real.

280
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,880
I didn't feel like I was all alone anymore.

281
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:11,780
uh would you like some hot tea perhaps no thank you I'm fine well I could use

282
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:17,360
some I'm feeling a bit thirsty you can just wait here

283
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,400
my secretary's already gone for the day she has a date

284
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,800
She really knows how to brew tea.

285
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,540
It's too bad she's not here to make it for us.

286
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,300
Hey, Doc.

287
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,940
Yes? What is it?

288
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,780
I figure your job's gotta be pretty tough.

289
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,360
I mean, there's a lot of pressure.

290
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,780
People telling you all about their dreams and secrets.

291
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,800
Including ones that you probably don't want to know about

292
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,580
You know, ones that could get you into trouble

293
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,160
Like mine

294
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,440
I mean, now you have to walk around knowing I'm a hitman

295
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,000
So

296
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,600
Anyhow

297
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,380
If you want to make amends towards your wife

298
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,380
You... you need to start talking with her.

299
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,380
I hope you forgot to lock that damn door, Merith.

300
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:12,580
Wait, why aren't you?

301
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,900
Get out of here, now!

302
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,340
Dr. Tenma?

303
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,900
I've been watching over you, Dr. Reitwein.

304
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,500
You're still in great danger.

305
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,060
You need to get out of here.

306
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,000
Now run!
