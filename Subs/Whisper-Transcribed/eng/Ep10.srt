00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:15,200

8
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,640
Well, well, well. Look at what we've got here.

9
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,920
It's a five-finger free-for-all wonder if there's anything valuable enough for a connoisseur like Otto heckle

10
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,620
You never know what's gonna happen first you're a shoo-in candidate for governor next thing you and your wife get shot

No, well down to business

12
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,880

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,700
why am I getting the chills this is creepy as hell I've never felt anything

14

20
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,460

21
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:59,340

23
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:17,240
today just ain't my day that's right I thought I recognized you you're all over the papers you're

24
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:24,060
The doctor wanted for questioning in connection with Councilman Springer's murder you are you a thief that I am but I got something called

25
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,880
Morals, I don't go around killing people you wouldn't know anything about the murders that happened in that house

26
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,960
Would you no idea so get out of my face? Will you later?

27
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,880
Hey doctor

28
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,220
You're some sort of top-notch surgeon aren't you my brilliant brain just came up with a fantastic idea

29
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,440
Do you think that people meet by chance doctor they don't believe me I know I believe in fate

30
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,900
I think people meet for a reason and my gut tells me you and I were destined to become partners

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,040
Call me crazy, but I think a lot of folks in the underground community need someone like you

32
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,520
You know guys who need to hide out so they can't go to regular doctors for help

33
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,900
Listen you leave the management to old heckle here. I'll make you the world's best underground doctor in no time

34
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm telling you doc. You're gonna make a lot of money. You'll be a millionaire before you know it

35
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,420
Hey, hey, hey doctor. Where you think you're going? There's something I have to do and it can't wait

36
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,520
Well, I'd hold my horses if I were you you want to know about the murders in that house, don't you?

37
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,580
Well, I guess he'd like to hear that I saw the killer am I right what did you say?

38
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,400
Are you telling me the truth you want to know what did he look like?

39
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,880
like i need to know was the killer blonde and about 20 years of age what are you on about

40
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,340
never mind you just tell me about who you saw there team up with me and i'd be happy to doctor

41
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:02,040
he's on the third floor so how did you come to know all of this anyway i spent a month checking

42
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,980
out the councilman's house casing the joint i do my homework just when i'm ready to make a move

43
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,400
the killer beats me to it 15 minutes later i look in the window and they're dead worm food

44
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,080
And, well, I figured I might be able to blackmail the murderer, so I followed him here.

45
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,320
This is all you really need to prove your innocence, Doc.

46
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,060
Know what I'm saying?

47
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,560
All you have to do is call the police and tell them.

48
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,680
After that, we should go somewhere.

49
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,980
Sit down, relax, talk over a drink about our future together as partners.

50
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,660
Hey!

51
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,800
Stop! What are you doing?

52
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,320
What do you want to talk to him for?

53
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,240
What, did you miss the part where he murders people?

54
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,480
Man, what is he thinking looking for trouble like that?

55
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,500
I'm out of here.

56
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,620
However, a cash cow like him is a rare opportunity.

57
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,480
Damn, I usually make it a rule not to stick my neck out, but...

58
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,160
Hey.

59
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,820
Another hot afternoon, isn't it?

60
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,140
I... I'm actually looking for someone.

61
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,480
Hey, Doc! You alive in there?

62
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,600
Doctor?

63
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,960
What are you doing? He's got a gun, dummy!

64
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,300
Mother and I, we often used to go walking together.

65
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:45,700
Huh?

66
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,880
On summer afternoons a lot like this one, there was a long road we took,

67
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,960
and alongside it a field of sunflowers, but Mother's dead now.

68
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,820
This is important, so I need you to listen.

69
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,920
Did someone ask you to use that gun?

70
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,780
Tell me, was it a man?

71
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,200
Was it a man? It was.

72
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,440
One day this young man came up to me at a local bar.

73
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,100
And was he about 20 years old, with blonde hair?

74
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,580
Huh?

75
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,240
He was, and he had a big, bright, beautiful smile.

76
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,720
Called himself Erich.

77
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,520
So he's going by Erich now.

78
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,420
We met a few times, and we eventually became very close friends.

79
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,360
He invited me over to the place where he was staying.

80
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,920
It was the estate of Councilman Springer.

81
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,280
Did he live in that mansion until recently?

82
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,440
Yes, he did, for a year, in fact.

83
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,200
He said they took good care of him.

84
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,520
He was like a son to them.

85
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,560
Wait a minute. I had my eye on that house for a month and never saw anyone who looked like that.

86
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,720
They were a wonderful family.

87
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,340
I have a picture. The councilman, his wife, and me.

88
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,580
However, there was something I couldn't forgive them for.

89
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,680
There was a beautiful area on their property, a bed of sunflowers in their yard.

90
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,160
But one day the councilman cleared it all up in order to build a bigger driveway.

91
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,480
so when I mentioned to my young friend that I thought it was awful I was

92
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,020
delighted to discover he agreed wait are you saying you actually killed them

93
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:18,820
because of some flowers hardly there was more to it he also told me councilman

94
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,860
Springer had a mistress that's when my friend looked at me and said I've

95
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,200
decided I no longer wish to live with or be a member of the Springer household

96
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,720
From now on, I'm not a part of that family anymore.

97
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,240
Then he proceeded to request of me that I erase the family.

98
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,900
Having a mistress is so inexcusable.

99
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,320
My mother was someone's mistress, too.

100
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,020
She was a kept woman, you know.

101
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,360
Listen, listen, don't think about all that stuff.

102
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,780
By the way, do you know where the safe is in that house?

103
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,060
I believe on the second floor in the library.

104
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,800
All right, then.

105
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,220
Doctor, you probably shouldn't stick around here.

106
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,400
You can erase your past. Did you know that?

107
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,420
If you don't like it, you can erase everything.

108
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,600
You can erase all of it.

109
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,460
You can reset your entire life if you want.

110
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,640
Sorry, I don't agree with that at all.

111
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,840
You may try to forget, but no one can simply erase their past like that.

112
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:31,840
yeah i guess you're right huh i wonder why i thought that it doesn't make any sense to me now

113
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,900
why did i think i could erase the past by pulling the trigger

114
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,540
looking back i wonder why i listened to him and did what he asked me

115
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:48,740
i think you should go now our talk is over i have nothing more to say

116
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, that's right.

117
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,040
Your name is Dr. Tenma, isn't it?

118
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,840
He left a message behind for you.

119
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,180
Do make sure you take a good look at it.

120
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,380
You'll find it in the Councilman's Library.

121
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,460
He predicted that you would come here, and he was correct about that.

122
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,780
Eric also mentioned to me,

123
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,040
your fate has already been decided for you.

124
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,640
So has mine.

125
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:34,640
doctor I told you didn't I did you actually shoot this guy Oh suicide I got

126
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,980
you what the hell

127
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,540
what's the use in dying everything's over when you're dead it makes no sense

128
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,760
sense. Hey, Doc, there's nothing like living, am I right? You know, I think I actually agree with

129
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,940
you for a change. Hey, what exactly do you mean for a change? Anyway, so you're after this killer

130
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,640
named Johan or whatever? I don't get it. I really don't know why you'd do that. Hey, why don't you

131
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,820
forget about this nonsense and team up with me? Oh, by the way, I don't know why, but when I tried

132
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,180
to open the door to this room before, it kind of gave me the creeps.

133
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,540
Hmm?

134
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,540
What the?

135
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,540
What's the matter? You're shaking like a leaf, Doc.

136
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,540
Look at me. Look at me.

137
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,740
The monster inside me is... getting bigger.

138
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,540
Johan, this... this is all just a game to you, isn't it?

139
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,480
Hey, Doc, wait up!

140
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,460
Oh, come on, wait! Listen to me! Hey, Doc, I'm talking to you!

141
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,300
Oh, for crying out loud!

142
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,520
I've got some really good news to tell you. You're gonna thank me for this.

143
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,640
You'll keep your promise and team up with me, right?

144
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,680
I never said I'd team up with you.

145
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,320
Hey!

146
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,040

147
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,280

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,960
what the hell'd you say i'm not helping people who took others lives indiscriminately

163
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,160
You shut your mouth! Do you realize the situation you're in right now?

164
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,960
Either you help him or you die!

165
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,160
Calm down, Carl.

166
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,460
Listen, Doctor, our friends will be coming to help us soon, so it's simple.

167
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,360
All you need to do is stop the bleeding to buy me some time.

168
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,860
What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you want to die?

169
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,660
I already told you to calm down.

170
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,760
Yeah, but... Counselor!

171
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,960
No, you listen to me very carefully.

172
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,340
My life is in this doctor's hands right now.

173
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,480
If I die, then you can shoot him.

174
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,460
We're not running a charity, you know.

175
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,780
You owe us, so you gotta pay back the 250,000 marks we lent you.

176
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,400
Simple as that, Otto Heckle.

177
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,200
But, Mr. Glouse, I wanna pay you back, sir.

178
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,960
That's nice. I'm glad you feel that way. I'll consider it.

179
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,660
Now go on ahead and break both his arms.

180
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,640
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll pay you back! I will!

181
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,080
That's a good boy.

182
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,580
I just need you to give me one more month.

183
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,020
Break both his legs, too.

184
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,560
Witnesses have helped police identify the main suspects.

185
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,500
They are Max Steindorf and Carl Bloch.

186
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,060
Oh, please, please wait!

187
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:32,580
The GWE is offering 300,000 marks for any information leading to the arrest of the terrorists.

188
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,980
Wait a minute, it's them.

189
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,440
Huh?

190
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,280
I can pay you back that money. I know where those guys are.

191
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,280
I really do and that'll take care what I owe you this had better be the truth

192
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,800
Otherwise, I'm gonna break your scrawny neck. It's show. It's true. Hey, would I lie? Oh

193
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,800
Man that's right. I forgot tennis still with those guys. Oh, well who cares

194
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,000
You called me a murderer who goes around killing people indiscriminately

195
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,800
Well, you're wrong, Doctor. What I did had meaning. There was a good reason for what I did.

196
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,780
Now that the president of GWE is dead, I can finally die in peace.

197
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,060
I really don't mind. I achieved what I set out to do.

198
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,040
Counselor, I used to be a lawyer in East Germany, and my friend here was a political secretary.

199
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,300
And when the wall came down, we lost our jobs.

200
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,900
Doctor, do you have any idea what it is like for us?

201
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,680
After the wall fell, GWE came to the east with their big funding

202
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,140
They barged in and built these factories on our land

203
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,120
One after another

204
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,980
That was our country, our land

205
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,060
They had no right to do that

206
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,840
They stepped all over our pride

207
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,340
Well, I'm proud to have shot that bastard

208
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,800
I'm glad that I did it

209
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:11,000
counselor it's cold I'm cold hang on just hang on our friends will be here soon they won't

210
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:24,720
come I have a feeling that our friends won't be joining us stop the bleeding now doctor hurry or

211
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:36,360
I'll shoot you don't do it I don't want to die I don't want to die I don't want

212
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,800
to die

213
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:50,160
are you afraid are you afraid of dying well now you know what they all felt

214
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,960
like the twelve people you killed that's how they died this is what they went

215
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:03,020
through. Now do you know what it means to kill someone? Get scissors and disinfectant.

216
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:13,320
Is that too much to ask? Arterial bleeding's pretty bad. He's in a state of shock from

217
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,440
low blood pressure. I can keep my hand pressed against the wound to stop the bleeding. I'm

218
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,440
We're gonna have to suture the open flesh here. Needle and thread.

219
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
We don't have that.

220
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Fine, then a stapler will do.

221
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
What? A stapler?

222
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Just go and get it!

223
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Yes, sir!

224
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Alright.

225
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,440
What? What do you think you're doing?

226
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,260
I've done what I can. He needs to get to a hospital.

227
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,760
What? A hospital? No! What are you thinking?

228
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,080
If you don't put him down right now, I'll kill you!

229
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,640
Pull the trigger if you want.

230
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,940
But if you kill me, know this.

231
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,940
You're gonna have to carry him to the hospital yourself.

232
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:33,260
put me down right here just save yourself

233
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:41,140
i just realized i've seen your face somewhere before you're the doctor wanted in connection

234
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,840
with those serial murders, aren't you?

235
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,260
Put me down, damn it.

236
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,740
What I did this morning was not an indiscriminate attack.

237
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,300
The men I killed were the president of GWE,

238
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,800
his lackeys, and his bodyguards,

239
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,220
and they all had it coming.

240
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
So you're telling me there were no innocent victims in that shooting?

241
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,700
You're talking about that girl at the newsstand.

242
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,020
You already knew about her then.

243
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,300
You knew you shot that girl, didn't you?

244
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,420
Why did you bother saving a man like me?

245
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,480
It wasn't because you were afraid to get shot.

246
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,160
You weren't afraid to die.

247
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,220
I could tell by the look in your eyes.

248
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,840
So why did you do it?

249
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,280
Why save a terrorist like me?

250
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,040
Why would you even bother?

251
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,900
Because I believe in you.

252
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,120
I have faith in your humanity.

253
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,360
You should get going. The police will be here soon.

254
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,080
You hang in there.

255
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,320
You too.

256
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,920
You are truly a great doctor.

257
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,000
And the money?

258
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,000
What happened to the money?

259
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,880
Hey, Doc! Don't tell me you fixed him and just left without getting paid!

260
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,720
for the Erfurt Station attack

261
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,880
were apprehended by police earlier this morning.

262
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,180
Why don't you say something? Come on!

263
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,520
The two alleged suspects surrendered to authorities

264
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,060
quietly and without incident.

265
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,320
Hey, we ain't operating no charity outfit here, Doc!
