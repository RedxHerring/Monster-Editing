1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:12,120
One Manhattan have a ball wait a second. Where's the cherry, huh? It's not a Manhattan without the cherry

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,400
Yeah, my mistake

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,900
I'll let it slide this time

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,400
Business always goes well when I'm sucking on one of these

5
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,860
A lucky charm is a lucky charm.

6
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,320
(dramatic music)

7
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,200
Come to papa, I just hope there's still something of value we're taking.

8
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,620
Well well well, lookie what we've got here.

9
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,460
Five-finger free-for-all.

10
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,100
Wonder if there's anything valuable enough

11
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,980
for a connoisseur like Otto Heckel.

12
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,220
Heh, you never know what's gonna happen.

13
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,440
First, you're a shoo-in candidate for governor.

14
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,760
Next thing, you and your wife get shot.

15
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,300
Oh well, down to business.

16
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,060
I'm guessing this is where they kept the safe.

17
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,320
(ominous music)

18
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,500
Why am I getting the chills? This is creepy as hell. I've never felt anything like this.

19
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,400
Could... could somebody be in there?

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,420
As if. What am I so scared about? It ain't like me to be a chicken.

21
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,900
Don't move. Put your hands behind your head.

22
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,440
Oh man, I can't believe this.

23
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,880
He forgot the cherry I said put your hands up. All right. All right. All right

24
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,700
Give me a break on this one officer. I haven't taken anything yet. I promise I'm not a cop

25
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,420
No, so you're robbing the place too, huh? Well in that case, why don't you just put that thing away?

26
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,740
We'll have ourselves behind your head now

27
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,560
Jeez, what's with this guy? He's a bigger boy scout than the friggin cops

28
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,180
You gotta be kidding me. Thanks for nothing, buddy

29
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,220
Don't follow me!

30
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,360
Someone like you just gets in the way!

31
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,820
You'll slow me down! Damn it all!

32
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,320
I told you to stop following me!

33
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,840
Damn, damn, today just ain't my day!

34
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,980
That's right! I thought I recognized you.

35
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,580
You're all over the papers.

36
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,660
You're the doctor wanted for questioning

37
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,840
in connection with Councilman Springer's murder.

38
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,020
And you, are you a thief?

39
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,720
That I am. But I got something called morals.

40
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,380
You wouldn't know anything about the murders that happened in that house, would you?

41
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,340
No idea, so get out of my face, will ya?

42
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,020
Later.

43
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,420
Hey, Doctor.

44
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,720
You're some sort of top-notch surgeon, aren't ya?

45
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,540
My brilliant brain just came up with a fantastic idea.

46
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,860
Do you think that people meet by chance, Doctor?

47
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,700
They don't.

48
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,040
Believe me, I know.

49
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,520
I believe in fate.

50
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,320
I think people meet for a reason.

51
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,020
My gut tells me you and I were destined to become partners.

52
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,460
Huh?

53
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,160
Call me crazy, but I think a lot of folks in the underground community need someone like you.

54
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,660
You know, guys who need to hide out so they can't go to regular doctors for help.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,680
Listen, you leave the management to old heckle here.

56
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll make you the world's best underground doctor in no time.

57
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,380
I'm telling you, Doc, you're gonna make a lot of money.

58
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,540
You'll be a millionaire before you know it.

59
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,440
Eh?

60
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,840
Hey, hey, Doctor, where do you think you're going?

61
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,600
There's something I have to do and it can't wait

62
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,560
Well, I'd hold my horses if I were you you want to know about the murders in that house, don't you?

63
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,720
Well, I guess he'd like to hear that I saw the killer am I right what did you say

64
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,640
Are you telling me the truth you want to know what did he look like?

65
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,880
I need to know what's the killer blonde and about 20 years of age. What are you on about?

66
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,320
Never mind. You just tell me about who you saw there team up with me and I'd be happy to doctor

67
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,660
He's on the third floor.

68
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,720
So how did you come to know all of this, anyway?

69
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,080
I spent a month checking out the councilman's house, casing the joint.

70
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,120
I do my homework.

71
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,420
Just when I'm ready to make a move, the killer beats me to it.

72
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,540
Fifteen minutes later, I look in the window and they're dead.

73
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,360
Worm food.

74
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,080
And, well, I figured I might be able to blackmail the murderer, so I followed him here.

75
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,340
This is all you really need to prove your innocence, Doc.

76
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,060
Know what I'm saying?

77
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,800
All you have to do is call the police and tell him after that

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,040
We should go somewhere sit down relax talk over a drink about our future together as partners

79
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,680
Hey

80
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,580
Stop what are you doing? What do you want to talk to him for what?

81
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Did you miss the part where he murders people man? What is he thinking looking for trouble like that? I'm out of here

82
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,640
However, a cash cow like him is a rare opportunity.

83
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,680
Damn, I usually make it a rule not to stick my neck out, but...

84
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,680
(ominous music)

85
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,060
- Hey.

86
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,780
Another hot afternoon, isn't it?

87
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,100
- I, I'm actually looking for someone.

88
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,480
- Hey, Doc, you alive in there?

89
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,580
- Doctor?

90
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,880
What are you doing?

91
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,960
He's got a gun, dummy.

92
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,880
- Mother and I,

93
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,300
We often used to go walking together.

94
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,920
On summer afternoons, a lot like this one,

95
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,880
there was a long road we took,

96
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,580
and alongside it a field of sunflowers,

97
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,960
but Mother's dead now.

98
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,820
This is important, so I need you to listen.

99
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,920
Did someone ask you to use that gun?

100
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,760
Tell me, was it a man?

101
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,200
Was it a man? It was.

102
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,440
One day, this young man came up to me at a local bar.

103
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,100
And was he about 20 years old, with blonde hair?

104
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,540
- Huh?

105
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,240
- He was, and he had a big, bright, beautiful smile.

106
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,540
Called himself Eric.

107
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,520
- So he's going by Eric now.

108
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
- We met a few times,

109
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,440
and we eventually became very close friends.

110
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,340
He invited me over to the place where he was staying.

111
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,900
It was the estate of Councilman Springer.

112
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,280
- Did he live in that mansion until recently?

113
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,420
- Yes, he did, for a year, in fact.

114
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,200
He said they took good care of him.

115
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,520
He was like a son to them.

116
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,640
- Wait a minute, I had my eye on that house for a month

117
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,560
I never saw anyone who looked like that.

118
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,720
They were a wonderful family.

119
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,500
I have a picture.

120
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,340
The councilman, his wife, and me.

121
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,560
However, there was something I couldn't forgive them for.

122
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,820
There was a beautiful area on their property,

123
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,660
a bed of sunflowers in their yard.

124
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
But one day the councilman cleared it all up

125
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,140
in order to build a bigger driveway.

126
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,780
So when I mentioned to my young friend

127
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,000
that I thought it was awful,

128
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,060
I was delighted to discover he agreed.

129
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you saying you actually killed them because of some flowers?

130
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,200
Hardly. There was more to it.

131
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,040
He also told me Councilman Springer had a mistress.

132
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,300
That's when my friend looked at me and said,

133
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,200
"I've decided I no longer wish to live with or be a member of the Springer household.

134
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,500
From now on, I'm not a part of that family anymore."

135
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,220
Then he proceeded to request of me that I erase the family.

136
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,920
Having a mistress is so inexcusable.

137
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,320
My mother was someone's mistress, too.

138
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,040
She was a kept woman, you know.

139
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,360
Listen, listen. Don't think about all that stuff.

140
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,780
By the way, do you know where the safe is in that house?

141
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,940
I believe on the second floor in the library.

142
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,800
All right, then.

143
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,220
Doctor, you probably shouldn't stick around here.

144
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,380
You can erase your past. Did you know that?

145
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,420
If you don't like it, you can erase everything.

146
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,620
You can erase all of it.

147
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,460
You can reset your entire life if you want.

148
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,640
Sorry, I don't agree with that at all.

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,800
You may try to forget, but no one can simply erase their past like that.

150
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,160
Yeah, I guess you're right.

151
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,100
Huh?

152
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,400
I wonder why I thought that.

153
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,820
It doesn't make any sense to me now.

154
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,880
Why did I think I could erase the past by pulling the trigger?

155
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,460
I did what he asked me.

156
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,860
I think you should go now.

157
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,020
Our talk is over.

158
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,700
I have nothing more to say.

159
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,960
Oh, that's right.

160
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,040
Your name is Dr. Tenma, isn't it?

161
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,820
He left a message behind for you.

162
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,180
Do make sure you take a good look at it.

163
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,480
You'll find it in the councilman's library.

164
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,500
He predicted that you would come here and he was correct about that.

165
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,020
Eric also mentioned to me, your fate has already been decided for you.

166
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,660
So has mine.

167
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,780
Doctor!

168
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,640
I told you, didn't I?

169
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,120
Did you actually shoot this guy?

170
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,920
Oh, suicide. I gotcha.

171
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,240
What the hell?

172
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,060
What's the use in dying?

173
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,960
Everything's over when you're dead. It makes no sense.

174
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,520
Hey, Doc, there's nothing like living, am I right?

175
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,480
You know, I think I actually agree with you for a change.

176
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,660
Hey, what exactly do you mean for a change?

177
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,140
Anyway, so you're after this killer named Johan or whatever?

178
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,060
I don't get it. I really don't know why you'd do that.

179
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,940
Hey, why don't you forget about this nonsense and team up with me?

180
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,140
Oh, by the way, I don't know why,

181
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,500
but when I tried to open the door to this room before,

182
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,240
it kind of gave me the creeps.

183
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,220
Hmm?

184
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
What the...?

185
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,400
What's the matter? You're shaking like a leaf, Doc.

186
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,760
Look at me. Look at me. The monster inside me is getting bigger.

187
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,540
Johan, this... this is all just a game to you, isn't it?

188
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,480
Hey, Doc, wait up!

189
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,500
Oh, come on, wait! Listen to me! Hey, Doc, I'm talking to you!

190
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,300
Oh, for crying out loud!

191
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,520
I've got some really good news to tell you. You're gonna thank me for this.

192
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,640
You'll keep your promise and team up with me, right?

193
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,680
I never said I'd team up with you.

194
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,460
Hey!

195
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,420
I just thought you might need some money to run from the cops, but I guess I was wrong.

196
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,140
Just get in the car.

197
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,660
This is our first client.

198
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,540
The nice man will escort you to your patient, Doc.

199
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
I'll hang on to your things for now.

200
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,320
If you want them back, you'd better do your job, get paid the rest, and meet up with me

201
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,180
at Frank's Tavern on Graston Street.

202
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,640
So long.

203
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,800
Now, get out there and earn your keep!

204
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,840
Now, that's what I call a profitable business.

205
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,840
Since I already got an advance, I suppose it's time to go and have a drink.

206
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,200
Hey, Counselor. I brought back a doctor for you.

207
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,280
Thank you for coming, Doctor.

208
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,880
Hurry. Please stop the bleeding.

209
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,900
It appears your auxiliary artery has been damaged.

210
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,460
Did you get hit by a shotgun?

211
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:23,460
Yeah.

212
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,280
Hey, the doctor is empty handed.

213
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,200
Did you get the surgical equipment?

214
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:28,880
No.

215
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,840
It was too dangerous in the city.

216
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,900
I couldn't get that far.

217
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,580
I couldn't operate on you here even if I had the proper equipment.

218
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,400
He needs to be taken to a fully equipped hospital.

219
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,440
I already would have done that if I'd been able to.

220
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,320
Save him already!

221
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,600
About how long ago was he wounded?

222
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,040
Four hours ago, huh?

223
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,240
Were you involved in the terrorist attack this morning?

224
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,680
And what does it matter if it were?

225
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,040
I won't do it.

226
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,920
What the hell'd you say?

227
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,620
I'm not helping people who took others' lives indiscriminately.

228
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,980
You shut your mouth!

229
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,160
Do you realize the situation you're in right now?

230
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,560
Either you help 'em or you die!

231
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,120
Calm down, Carl.

232
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:25,780
Our friends will be coming to help us soon, so it's simple all you need to do is stop the bleeding to buy me some time

233
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,420
What the hell do you think you're doing do you want to die I already told you to calm down yeah, but

234
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,360
Counselor no you listen to me very carefully my life is in this doctor's hands right now

235
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,280
if I die

236
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,540
Then you can shoot him

237
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,700
Oh, yeah

238
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,400
We're not running a charity, you know, you owe us so you got to pay back the

239
00:15:52,400 --> 00:16:00,280
250,000 marks we lent you simple as that Otto heckle, but mr. Gloss. I want to pay you back, sir. That's nice

240
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm glad you feel that way. I'll consider it

241
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,940
Now go on ahead and break both his arms

242
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,640
That's a good boy, I just need you to give me one more month

243
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,460
- Break both his legs, too. - Ah-ha-ha!

244
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,580
Witnesses have helped police identify the main suspects.

245
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,540
They are Max Steindorf and Carl Blum.

246
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,920
- Oh, please, please wait! - The G.W.E. is offering 300,000 marks

247
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,580
for any information leading to the arrest of the terrorists.

248
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,440
- Wait a minute, it's them. - Huh?

249
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,280
I can pay you back that money. I know where those guys are.

250
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,740
I really do. And that'll take care of what I owe you.

251
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,360
This had better be the truth.

252
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,640
Otherwise, I'm gonna break your scrouny neck.

253
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,540
Hey, would I lie oh

254
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,020
Man that's right. I forgot time is still with those guys. Oh, well, who cares?

255
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,000
You called me a murderer who goes around killing people indiscriminately

256
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,820
Well, you're wrong doctor what I did had meaning there was a good reason for what I did

257
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,780
Now that the president of G.W.E. is dead, I can finally die in peace.

258
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,060
I really don't mind. I achieved what I set out to do.

259
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,620
Counselor...

260
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,040
I used to be a lawyer in East Germany, and my friend here was a political secretary.

261
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,300
And when the wall came down, we lost our jobs.

262
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,900
Doctor, do you have any idea what it is like for us?

263
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,680
After the wall fell, G.W.E. came to the east with their big funding.

264
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,140
They barged in and built these factories on our land.

265
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,080
One after another.

266
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,980
That was our country, our land.

267
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,060
They had no right to do that.

268
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,820
They stepped all over our pride.

269
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,280
Well, I'm proud to have shot that bastard.

270
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,740
I'm glad that I did it.

271
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,620
- Counselor... - It's cold. I'm cold.

272
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,920
Hang on. Just hang on. Our friends will be here soon.

273
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,500
They won't come.

274
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,600
I have a feeling that our friends won't be joining us.

275
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,660
Stop the bleeding! Now, Doctor!

276
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,440
Hurry or I'll shoot you!

277
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,680
Don't do it!

278
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,460
I don't want to die.

279
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,640
I don't want to die.

280
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,020
I don't want to die.

281
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,140
Are you afraid? Are you afraid of dying?

282
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,560
Well, now you know what they all felt like.

283
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,000
The twelve people you killed, that's how they died.

284
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,280
This is what they went through.

285
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,640
Now do you know what it means to kill someone?

286
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,000
Get scissors and disinfectant.

287
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,160
Is that too much to ask?

288
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,800
Arterial bleeding's pretty bad.

289
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,160
He's in a state of shock from low blood pressure.

290
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,320
I can keep my hand pressed against the wound to stop the bleeding.

291
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,260
I'm gonna have to suture the open flesh here.

292
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,200
Needle and thread.

293
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,900
We don't have that.

294
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,320
Fine, then a stapler will do.

295
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,760
What? A stapler?

296
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,200
Just go and get it!

297
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:28,920
Yes, sir!

298
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,740
(eerie music)

299
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,620
- All right.

300
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,420
- What, what do you think you're doing?

301
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,740
- I've done what I can.

302
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,220
He needs to get to a hospital.

303
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,460
- What, a hospital?

304
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,220
If you don't put him down right now, I'll kill you

305
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:10,740
Pull the trigger if you want, but if you kill me know this you're gonna have to carry him to the hospital yourself

306
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:38,420
put me down right here just save yourself i just realized i've seen your face somewhere

307
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,860
You're the doctor wanted in connection with those serial murders, aren't you?

308
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,300
Put me down, damn it!

309
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,740
What I did this morning was not an indiscriminate attack.

310
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,780
The men I killed were the president of G.W.E., his lackeys, and his bodyguards.

311
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,220
And they all had it coming.

312
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,600
So you're telling me there were no innocent victims in that shooting?

313
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,700
You're talking about that girl at the newsstand.

314
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,020
You already knew about her then.

315
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,300
You knew you shot that girl, didn't you?

316
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,420
Why did you bother saving a man like me?

317
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,460
It wasn't because you were afraid to get shot.

318
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,160
You weren't afraid to die.

319
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,240
I could tell by the look in your eyes.

320
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,840
So why did you do it?

321
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,280
Why save a terrorist like me?

322
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,060
Why would you even bother?

323
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,100
Because I believe in you. I have faith in your humanity

324
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,150
You should get going the police will be here soon you hang in there

325
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,020
You too, you are truly a great doctor

326
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:06,460
And the money? What happened to the money? Hey, Doc, don't tell me you fixed him and

327
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,860
just left without getting paid.

328
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,300
...responsible for the Erfurt Station attack were apprehended by police earlier this morning.

329
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,180
Why don't you say something? Come on!

330
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,040
The two alleged suspects surrendered to authorities quietly and without incident.

331
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,320
Hey! We ain't operating no charity outfit here, Doc!
