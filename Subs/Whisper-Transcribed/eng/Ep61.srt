1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,880
You got a job as a waitress and found a place to live.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,520
And you got furniture, too.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,100
But this bed is terrible.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,340
I'm just sitting on it and it's tilting like it's gonna sink into the floor.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,960
If you put all your weight on it, it'll fall apart.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,200
So it looks like I'm gonna be the one sleeping on this bed.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,980
You'll be more comfortable on that sofa.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,180
There's no place for you to sleep, Dieter.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:23,700
Huh?

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,680
It's time you packed up your things and returned to Dr. Reichwein's place in Munich.

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:29,980
Why should I?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,840
You know very well, because you have to go back to school now.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,640
I don't need school. I don't want to go.

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,360
And just how are you going to learn anything?

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,420
You can teach me what I need to know.

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,060
It's more than just your studies.

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,420
You won't be able to make any friends living like this.

18
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,760
Well, I already have friends, named Nina and Tenma.

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,940
Besides, you need my company.

20
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,940
You'd be very lonely if I wasn't around.

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,620
Nice try, but you're going back to Munich anyway.

22
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,160
No, I'm not!

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,260
Forget it. I'm not going to Munich.

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,280
Wait a minute, Nina. Are you going back there again today?

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,340
Stop it already!

26
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,600
You've got to give it up now.

27
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,760
You keep going to that same place every day.

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,160
No matter how many times you do it, it's always the same.

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,720
You never remember anything.

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,640
Nina!

31
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:57,160
The three frogs. We lived here. Mother and I. And Johan.

32
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,200
Here, that day, as he struggled, Johan was dragged down these stairs and taken away.

33
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,260
No! Let go of me! Stop! Mother! Nina!

34
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,860
That's wrong.

35
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,320
Because Nina's the name I have now.

36
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,120
So what was the name that mother called me way back then?

37
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,740
Nina? Anna? I can't remember which one was my name.

38
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,480
The car those men put Johan into traveled along this same road.

39
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,480
Keeping secrets from him is definitely a no-no.

40
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,460
They gathered all the children together every single Friday afternoon at three o'clock for

41
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,500
book readings here at the Red Rose Mansion.

42
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,080
Looks like the lock's broken.

43
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,060
This is where they worked trying to create a superior pupil.

44
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,580
What is a superior pupil?

45
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,400
Yohan...

46
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,820
And they...

47
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,600
But who did it? Who was responsible?

48
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,640
He escaped.

49
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,200
"Yohan ran away. He ran through the rose bushes."

50
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:28,480
"Are you alright? Was this the pain? The pain is...could it be? While I...was waiting

51
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:36,620
this room for mom to come home for Johan to come home I was reading this picture

52
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:46,380
book people can become whatever they want to be by Franz Bonaparta readings

53
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,300
of mr. Bonaparta's picture books were being held at the Red Rose Mansion at

54
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,500
the same time I was reading this one as I waited for Johan to come home

55
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,420
I stood in this room facing the front door.

56
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,480
I remember I was smiling and saidâ€¦

57
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,840
"Welcome home."

58
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,660
Welcome home.

59
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,200
Welcome home.

60
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,240
Welcome home.

61
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,500
Welcome home.

62
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,780
Welcome home.

63
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,840
Welcome home.

64
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,120
Welcome home.

65
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,080
Welcome home. Welcome home.

66
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,160
Welcome home. Welcome home.

67
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,300
Now, come with me.

68
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,360
The door won't open.

69
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,740
No matter how many times I said, "Welcome home,"

70
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,000
the door won't open.

71
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,160
The door won't open.

72
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,480
That's because I--

73
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,760
I remember.

74
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,820
I remember.

75
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,580
Stop it, Nina.

76
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,080
You don't have to remember it.

77
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,900
You don't have to remember anything at all.

78
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,920
I'm the same.

79
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,540
I have lots of terrible memories floating around, too.

80
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,360
But I don't have to remember those things,

81
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,360
and neither should you.

82
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,400
All right.

83
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,960
I'll go back to Dr. Ragvines and go to school.

84
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,560
But you come with me.

85
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,980
Let's go back together, Nina.

86
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,840
Come on, why don't we do what Tenma said?

87
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,060
We'll make our own.

88
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
Good memories only.

89
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,080
From now on, Nina.

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,900
Hold on a second, Chief Detective.

91
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,500
You mean I'm to be an observer

92
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,600
We're complying with your request.

93
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,140
Under the circumstances, it's the best we can offer you.

94
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,060
The best, really? I'm being allowed 30 minutes per person to observe.

95
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,360
I don't think that's enough time.

96
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,000
It's sufficient. You're just going to be listening.

97
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,360
And I think it's extraordinary that we've done so much to cooperate with you in this matter.

98
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,800
We've finally been allowed to talk to these people,

99
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,300
but it'll be a miracle if we can get any usable information from them.

100
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,100
I need more time. I need to collect as many testimonies as possible.

101
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,040
Don't be naive.

102
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,940
Most likely these people won't remember or want to talk about anything from their pasts.

103
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,920
The book readings occurred when they were just kids.

104
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,960
My own personal theory is, the numerous bodies that our men were able to uncover at the Red

105
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,340
Rose Mansion must have some direct connection to the former Czechoslovakian secret police.

106
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,940
However, the truth in this case may never be known.

107
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,680
Things like this usually remain a mystery forever.

108
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,960
Ah, here's the detective who's in charge of the case.

109
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,520
This is the lawyer from Germany, Mr. Werdemann. I'll leave the rest to you.

110
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,680
I'm Detective Suk.

111
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,920
Nice to meet you.

112
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,080
I prepared a list of questions in advance. I'll be asking them.

113
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,860
Please, do as I say. I need your full cooperation.

114
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,720
You're only coming in here as an observer. I want to make that very clear.

115
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,600
Number 3, Cerveni Street, also known as "The Red Rose Mansion."

116
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,640
It burned down, and this photo shows what's left of it.

117
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,540
From what we've ascertained so far, you were there in 1968

118
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,820
and participated in weekly book readings, isn't that right, Mr. Erno?

119
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,580
Well, Mr. Erno?

120
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,820
Does the name Franz Bonaparta sound familiar to you?

121
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,800
Look, would you please be quiet?

122
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,720
We don't have much time.

123
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,300
I'm just trying to be careful!

124
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,400
If you're this careful, you'll end up with no information when you're done.

125
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,340
You have no idea how hard we've had to work to prepare them for this interview process!

126
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,540
I'm not feeling sad.

127
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,000
I had always thought that the mansion was my emotional foundation.

128
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,660
And as I was viewing this image of the burned remains,

129
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,420
I thought I'd feel very sad.

130
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,880
But there isn't a bit of sadness anywhere in me.

131
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,340
Do you feel at all nostalgic about the mansion?

132
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,860
Nostalgic?

133
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,380
Yes, because you spent a lot of time there.

134
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,520
The mansion was like a school to you, wasn't it?

135
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,700
Mr. Vertimon, would you please be quiet and let me ask the questions that I've prepared?

136
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,020
I'm not sure I know.

137
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,980
Feeling sadness.

138
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,500
Nostalgia.

139
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,820
I'm not sure.

140
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,660
Emotional scars?

141
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,560
What do you mean by that?

142
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,200
Let me ask it another way.

143
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,020
Do you believe your participation in those weekly book readings has in some way negatively affected you throughout your adult life?

144
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,120
Uh...

145
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,760
Not really.

146
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,300
in your family life?

147
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,120
You don't have to answer that.

148
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,140
Remember, you have the right to refuse.

149
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,660
Well, I'm divorced.

150
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,680
There really weren't any big problems between my wife and me.

151
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,120
We got along for the most part.

152
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,500
But my children,

153
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,880
my oldest son and my second son, both committed suicide.

154
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,040
They didn't seem to have any troubles or problems,

155
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,560
but for some reason,

156
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,380
They both killed themselves, and I've always had to wonder why.

157
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,020
Is there something you're trying to say?

158
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,220
I'll save you the trouble of figuring it out.

159
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,200
I feel your whole line of questioning is far too by-the-book.

160
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,220
So far, you haven't been able to get anything useful from anyone.

161
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,780
I think you typify the way today's youth operates.

162
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,520
If it's not in a manual, you're unable to make a move.

163
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,020
That probably applies to how you pick up women, too.

164
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,920
Who do you think you are, my father?

165
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,620
Father, for the record, I don't have a father.

166
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,780
And if I did, I wouldn't want one like you.

167
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,140
The next person may come in now.

168
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,560
Memories of the book readings, huh? I'm not sure.

169
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,660
Anything you can tell us, no matter how small.

170
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,560
The God of Peace was very busy.

171
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,920
Hey, come on! What are you trying to do?

172
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,280
He was so busy playing the trumpet,

173
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,840
he didn't have time to look in the mirror.

174
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,600
It's a passage from Klaus Pope's The God of Peace.

175
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,980
It sounds familiar, doesn't it?

176
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,300
It does. I kind of think I remember it.

177
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,800
And there was another one.

178
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,920
Yeah, it was about the monster from the west and the monster from the east.

179
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,040
I liked that one much better.

180
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,240
Could you describe what you liked most about these storybooks?

181
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,660
Hmm, how should I put it?

182
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,460
I guess I could say that they all took me away to a different world.

183
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,640
Different how?

184
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,500
Crying when you're sad.

185
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,420
Being happy as well as being afraid and fearful.

186
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,580
All those feelings just seemed to go away, I'd say.

187
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,680
Why did you feel that way about these books?

188
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,980
I really don't know.

189
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,800
Actually, I didn't feel anything about anything.

190
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,520
Even your name disappears. I didn't want it.

191
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,140
Think about it. That's true freedom.

192
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,340
That's what it felt like, anyway.

193
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,560
But why did you feel like that?

194
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,300
Did Franz Bonaparta teach you to feel that way?

195
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,000
Hmm. Was he the person who held all those readings?

196
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,340
Was that the name of the guy?

197
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,740
This is what you clearly remember learning

198
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,720
That's what I clearly remember? No.

199
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,000
One afternoon, while I was there, a man came by to visit the mansion.

200
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,620
He said he was from a radio station.

201
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,420
He mentioned a song that was a favorite of his called "Over the Rainbow,"

202
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,900
and he took the time to tell me about the Wizard of Oz.

203
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,420
What was his name, did he say?

204
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,660
Tell me! Tell me everything about him right now!

205
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,400
Calm down! What the hell are you doing?

206
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:10,800
Tell me!

207
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,080
Anything!

208
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,540
What's going on? What just happened in there?

209
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,180
Suddenly it's as if your questions have personal feelings attached to them!

210
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,840
It's personal for you too, right?

211
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:29,180
You're the young detective who was framed for the series of crimes that were actually committed by the secret police.

212
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,920
That was you, wasn't it, Detective Suk?

213
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,080
You're desperate to dispel all the allegations and suspicion around you.

214
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,320
Am I wrong?

215
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,860
You and I are the same.

216
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,060
My father was imprisoned for working as an East German spy during the Cold War.

217
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,980
I always believed that he was falsely accused.

218
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,220
Then I found out that he was a spy all along.

219
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,820
I could no longer believe in anybody.

220
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,960
I no longer believed in anything in the world.

221
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,880
I'm pursuing a case involving a man who's truly innocent.

222
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,820
So now I found somebody I can believe in again.

223
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,560
That man from the radio station the witness was talking about?

224
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,500
That man was my father.

225
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,700
My father might have taken part in the brainwashing experiments that occurred at the Red Rose Mansion.

226
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,160
I mustn't look away. I have to find out the truth.

227
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,000
Say, may I go home now?

228
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,840
It'll be just a bit longer.

229
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,900
That man from the radio station that I was talking about?

230
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:44,400
to me. He said, "You get out of here fast. There's a wonderful land somewhere over the

231
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,940
rainbow. That's where your family is," he said to me. "Dorothy, the brave little girl

232
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,420
from the Wizard of Oz, is able to go back home in the end. You have to get out of here

233
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:01,820
too," he said. "Go home." So then directly after that, I cut all my

234
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,800
ties to the mansion. Have you heard enough? My wife and kid are waiting on me at home.

235
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,680
Yeah.

236
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,180
You mustn't look away.

237
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,040
I know.

238
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,380
We need to finish. There are two more.

239
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,060
All right. Let's keep going.

240
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,100
Come on, Dieter, stay focused.

241
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,040
I need you to hold this while I work.

242
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,540
After all, it's going to be your study desk.

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,860
Nina doesn't want to talk about anything

244
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,440
that happened in Prague just yet.

245
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,620
According to what I heard from you,

246
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,480
she's recovered quite a bit of her memory.

247
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,300
She's probably thinking about those things in her past.

248
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,780
But it seems that right before her memories

249
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,320
fully come back to her, she just stops remembering.

250
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,680
And that's because of you.

251
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,740
I keep wondering if maybe I did something bad.

252
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,200
- No, you certainly didn't.

253
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,880
You did a very good job, Dieter.

254
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,720
Now, what do you say we finish

255
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,080
putting this desk together quickly

256
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,040
so we can go have ourselves some weisswurst?

257
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,220
- Did you forget?

258
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,200
We ate all the weisswurst last night.

259
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,700
- What do you mean we ate it all?

260
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,440
Oh, darn it, you're right.

261
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,820
- Doctor!

262
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,940
We brought you something.

263
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,020
It's your favorite, weisswurst.

264
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,340
- How considerate of you, my boy.

265
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,540
You've saved the day.

266
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,480
- Dr. Reichfein, how are you?

267
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,460
I'm sorry for not contacting you for so long.

268
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,380
I'm sure I've had you worried.

269
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,260
But I'm fine.

270
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,860
The truth is, Dr. Reichwein, I have a favor to ask.

271
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,340
I believe you know Eva Heinemann, don't you?

272
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,320
She's being targeted by a certain organization right now.

273
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,960
I've sent her in your direction.

274
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,280
Please take good care of her.

275
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,000
And please, look after Nina and Dieter as well.

276
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:14,640
It'll all be over soon. I believe that there is only one way I can put an end to this.

277
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
Sincerely, Kenzo Tenma.

278
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,580
Tenma's letter arrived here about three days ago, but so far Ava hasn't shown up. There's been no sign of her.

279
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,120
I'm wondering what city this letter was sent from.

280
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,540
The postmark doesn't show up clearly. Is there a way to figure it out?

281
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,500
Probably. I'll try.

282
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,380
Then we'll know where Tianmei is, right?

283
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,140
Yeah, but in the meantime,

284
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,760
I'm a bit worried about this last sentence that he wrote.

285
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,940
It'll all be over soon.

286
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,140
I believe that there is only one way I can put an end to this.

287
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,060
Enough of that.

288
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,200
Let's go finish that study desk.

289
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,460
I could use your help.

290
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,120
I hope that beer won't impair my coordination.

291
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,340
Dr. Reichwein, I want to remember all the memories from my past.

292
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,780
When you remember them, are you prepared for the consequences?

293
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,300
Yes. I'm ready for you to try any means necessary to bring back my full memory.

294
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,120
To be honest, I don't want to try anything myself.

295
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,500
However, let me see what I can do if that's what you really want.

296
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,160
You're sure you're alright with this?

297
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,240
Yes, Dr. Gillen. But...

298
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,600
Hmm?

299
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,080
After you've put me in a hypnotic state, there might be some things...

300
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,180
that are absolutely terrifying.

301
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,500
Will you face them with me, Dr. Gillen?

302
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,340
Don't worry, Nina. I'll be here.

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,320
Every step of the way.

304
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,160
First, I want you to close your eyes.

305
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,280
Next, take a deep breath and release it, relaxing your whole body.

306
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,820
Tell me, what was your mother like?

307
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,200
My mother?

308
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,440
My mother was gentle,

309
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,040
the songs, the singing,

310
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,460
a very beautiful voice,

311
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,340
the smell of pea soup that she always made for us.

312
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,620
What about your father?

313
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,800
My father wasâ€¦

314
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,100
My father wasâ€¦

315
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,980
a government soldier.

316
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,780
A government soldier?

317
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,740
Did you ever meet your father?

318
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,660
I never had a chance.

319
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,200
My mother told me what happened to him.

320
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,880
My father, he was killed.

321
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,280
My mother was a political activist.

322
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,440
Your mother, who had taken part in anti-government activities,

323
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,340
fled the country with her children when your father was killed.

324
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,600
Who was she running away from?

325
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,260
She moved us into the Three Frogs.

326
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,400
We had to hide there.

327
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,580
But then one day my brother was caught

328
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,380
by a man with glasses.

329
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,140
When your brother was caught, where did they take him?

330
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,700
To the Red Rose Mansion!

331
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,560
A lot of people died that day.

332
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,980
Did your brother see what happened to the people?

333
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,540
It hurts! It hurts!

334
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,940
It hurts! The thorns hurt!

335
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,580
Welcome home.

336
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,340
Can you hear me, Nina?

337
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,300
I got it. I found out where Tenma's letter was mailed from.

338
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,440
Well, where?

339
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,740
It was Frankfurt.

340
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,080
Nina, you've remembered everything now, haven't you, Nina?

341
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,580
Not Nina. It's not my name.

342
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,080
Well, who are you then?

343
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,260
I don't want to say.

344
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,940
There's nothing to be afraid of. You can tell me. It's all right.

345
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,580
Who am I talking to?

346
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,720
Don't be afraid. You're safe here.

347
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,720
Don't wanna say.

348
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,020
Back!

349
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,360
And back!

350
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,080
I'm going to clap my hands right now.

351
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,480
And when I do, you're going to wake up from your trance!

352
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,860
Nina!

353
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,260
We're all right now.

354
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,980
Did Iâ€¦ Did I say something really terrible?

355
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,460
No, but while you were hypnotized, you refused to tell me everything, Nina.

356
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,180
But I'm sure you remember all of it now, isn't that right?

357
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,860
Dear Dr. Reichwein, Dieter,

358
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,020
Please forgive me for leaving so suddenly.

359
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,560
I'm going to Frankfurt, where Tenma is.

360
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,600
I know everything.

361
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:15,460
Who I am, where Johan came from, and where he is headed.

362
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,100
If I go, I can put an end to everything.

363
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,360
If I go, I can save Tenma.

364
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,660
(eerie music)

365
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,860
[MUSIC]

366
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,500
(gentle music)
