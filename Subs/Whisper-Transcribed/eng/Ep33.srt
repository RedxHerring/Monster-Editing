1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,080
That's amazing.

2
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,880
It'll be okay now, little bird.

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,520
It's your home. I respect it.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,980
Never again will blood be shed in this forest.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,300
Isn't that right?

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:29,980
We'll be right back.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
♪♪♪

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
♪♪♪

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:19,980
We'll see you next time.

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:49,980
I don't know.

11
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:07,120
So you don't remember anything?

12
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,700
I need you to take your time and try to think back to the roof.

13
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,580
Any detail you can remember about what you were doing up there would be helpful.

14
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,480
Martin, you have to tell the doctor what happened.

15
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,820
If you hadn't hit the eave on the first floor

16
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,040
and got caught in the tree, you would have died.

17
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,820
Do you understand?

18
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,000
Please, Martin, just talk to the doctor.

19
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,140
If you don't, we're never going to put

20
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,520
all this foolishness behind us.

21
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,360
Madam, do please try to stay calm.

22
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,620
Doctor, if he were to die, I don't know what I'd...

23
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,560
I just don't.

24
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,380
It's all right, madam.

25
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,660
I'm here to see that your son gets the counseling he needs.

26
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,280
I know. I know. It's just...

27
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
Look, why don't we take this conversation outside?

28
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,960
Now, Dieter, I want you to behave yourself while I'm gone.

29
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,780
And remember, you're not allowed inside that room.

30
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,040
That boy, is he your grandson?

31
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,820
No, I'm just taking care of him for a while.

32
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:49,260
I don't know.

33
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:59,200
Uh, hi there.

34
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,240
Hi yourself.

35
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,020
Uh, my name's Dieter.

36
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
I'm Martin

37
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,200
Does it hurt

38
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,220
Does what hurt that stuff all the cuts under your bandages?

39
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,280
When you fell off the roof, but that was really scary for you

40
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,240
Hey, what are you doing? You shouldn't be standing up my shoes are in that bag down there on the floor get them for me

41
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,360
I can't you've got to lie down

42
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,240
- Look, just get the shoes.

43
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,620
- Where do you think you're going?

44
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,120
You're gonna get yelled at.

45
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,320
- Why should I care if someone yells at me?

46
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,540
It's not like I'm afraid to get yelled at.

47
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
It's just like he told me.

48
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,880
If you come back alive, step outside.

49
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,700
The world will be different.

50
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Nah, the world didn't change. I'm the one who changed.

51
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,280
You see, I'm one of the special few who've been chosen.

52
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:50,660
I'm so bored

53
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,820
I never realized how boring this world is

54
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Hey, look out!

55
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Come on, hurry up. There's really nothing to be afraid of.

56
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:50,080
What did you do that for?

57
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,780
Check it out. Look how scared this guy is.

58
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,380
Martin, stop!

59
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,500
No, just look at him, Dieter.

60
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,260
Someone please help.

61
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
I don't want to die!

62
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
Yeah!

63
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Guess you're lucky.

64
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
'Cause I'm gonna let you live.

65
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
I have an answer to that question.

66
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
Huh?

67
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,280
You said you thought that falling off the roof was scary for me, right?

68
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Yeah, I did.

69
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Falling wasn't even a bit scary.

70
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
After all, it's just a game.

71
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,280
J-just a game?

72
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,280
But so many people have died 'cause of it!

73
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Ah, but it's so much fun.

74
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Who cares about those guys?

75
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Two people stand facing each other on the edge of the roof of an empty building.

76
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:09,320
building then you close your eyes and walk towards each other one step at a time it's like a duel

77
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:16,120
and it doesn't matter whether you fall or not if you survive you win why play a game like that

78
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,440
you do it so that you can bet against fate those who manage to survive are the chosen ones

79
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:30,520
how can i put this in a way you'll understand the survivor gets to keep playing over and over again

80
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,160
Yeah, but Martin, why play the game at all?

81
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,820
Because everything else is boring, that's why.

82
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,700
But the game is real fun.

83
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,200
And the best part is playing it again once fate has made you a chosen one.

84
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,560
Don't you get it?

85
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
And I thought for sure that you must be one of us.

86
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,000
Fine, I'll show you.

87
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,920
If you don't get it after seeing it, then you really are stupid.

88
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:09,720
Hey. Hey, you're not really planning on going up to the roof, are you?

89
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,220
Yeah, because I'm chosen. The superior will always survive, just like him.

90
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,340
Just like who?

91
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,100
The person who taught us the game, you dummy.

92
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,440
And who is that?

93
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,640
He's a friend. A friend to all the children who've been chosen.

94
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:35,240
now hurry up get over here i don't think i want to stop whining and come on let go of me

95
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,100
but you need to understand

96
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:49,340
those scars who did that to you bet it was your parents huh are you really gonna stay with them

97
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,120
after they did something like that you still want to be a part of this worthless world even after

98
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,460
Everything they've done to you come on you have to see

99
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,220
What do you think how's the view how does it make you feel oh?

100
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:19,000
Come on, there's nothing to be afraid of stand up close your eyes and take a step

101
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Stand Dieter

102
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,560
I understand now. I get what you've been saying. It all makes sense to me.

103
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,280
I thought the world was filled with darkness.

104
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,020
That the future would bring nothing but more misery.

105
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,040
I mean, like, what's your favorite food?

106
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,080
I ate this really good sausage the other day, but if I die, I'll never get to eat it again.

107
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,080
You're such a coward.

108
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,320
I really like playing soccer.

109
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,820
If I die, I'll never get to play again.

110
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,300
You're so weak.

111
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,380
And I really like Dr. Reikwein.

112
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,280
And his secretary, Ms. Merith, is nice to me.

113
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,880
If I die, I'll never see him again.

114
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,460
There are always things to be scared of.

115
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,160
Learning to deal with that is part of growing up.

116
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,660
Tenma told me tomorrow's gonna be a good day.

117
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:26,200
If I die, I will never get to see Tenma again.

118
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,820
I'm gonna fall!

119
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:59,420
Don't panic. Just don't stand up yet.

120
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,600
I can't be like him.

121
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,260
I can't be like Johan. I just can't.

122
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,340
What did you say?

123
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,400
Johan is playing an even scarier game than this one.

124
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,360
He said that he was going to be killed soon.

125
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,780
He said that he was going to be shot by a Japanese guy.

126
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,540
I closed my eyes, and I walked across the edge of the roof.

127
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm not kidding. I really did walk it.

128
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,540
And I wasn't scared at all, you know.

129
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,220
Joachim was supposed to be walking across for me,

130
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,480
but when I opened my eyes, he wasn't there anymore.

131
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,500
I really saw it.

132
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,540
He fell off the building and died right in front of me.

133
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,420
People really die.

134
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,240
Anyone want tea?

135
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,020
Oh, thank you.

136
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,140
Honestly, I just don't know about my son.

137
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,320
He doesn't seem to understand what he's done.

138
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,620
I'm glad he's still alive.

139
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,760
But when I think of what poor Joachim's parents are going through,

140
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,460
I just hope you manage to talk some sense into him.

141
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,600
At least he seems to listen to you.

142
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:25,600
Ugh. She gets on my case like that every day. Seriously, she doesn't understand anything.

143
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,780
She won't let me out of the house or watch TV or even read my comics.

144
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,860
Nothing's worse than boredom. I'll bring you something to help pass the time.

145
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,040
Really?

146
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,220
You may not be allowed to read comics, but a picture book should be okay.

147
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,680
Serious? A picture book? That sounds pretty stupid to me.

148
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,740
Hey, tell me about that freaky new game you said you were playing.

149
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,240
You said you were going to be shot and killed like any minute now.

150
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,020
Now that is exciting.

151
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,200
So come on, when is that Japanese guy going to shoot you?

152
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,740
Spill it, Johan.

153
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,200
Hermann Hesse, a first edition of Steppenwolf.

154
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,040
And this, a first edition of Hoffman's Night Pieces,

155
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,220
and a complete anthology of Goethe's poetry.

156
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,040
This is very impressive.

157
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,320
Despite being the head librarian of the University of Munich Friedrich Emanuel Campus Library,

158
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm simply dazzled by your collection.

159
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,260
I managed to make my way through life without a proper college education.

160
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,860
I made up for this by reading every book I could get a hold of.

161
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,960
Well, your decision to donate this collection is a priceless gift to the university.

162
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,600
I cannot begin to express my gratitude.

163
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,740
My eyes are failing, and I've lost the keen vision that reading requires.

164
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,760
I'd much rather these books be accessible to your students than sitting here in my private stacks collecting dust.

165
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:10,160
Of course. You have a number of priceless books here, but I would also prefer to make them available to the public.

166
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,140
Oh, that reminds me. We've just finished arranging storage for them.

167
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,420
And would it be possible to arrange a meeting at the library to discuss holding a ceremony of some sort?

168
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,280
Well, how's the security there?

169
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:28,380
There are a few dangerous organizations we've had to keep an eye on ever since Mr. Schuvel re-entered public life.

170
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,840
We just want to make sure you review your guest list thoroughly.

171
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,460
Wouldn't you agree, Johan?

172
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,820
Of course.

173
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,440
It was Johann and Karl who thought up the idea of donating the collection.

174
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,880
They'll make all the necessary arrangements.

175
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,440
I'm Germont, the head librarian.

176
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,460
Pleasure to meet you.

177
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,680
The pleasure's all mine.

178
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:06,040
This is where we'll be storing Mr. Schuwald's collection

179
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,220
The general public is not allowed entry

180
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,980
You've never been here, have you?

181
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,700
Of course, we'll maintain the appropriate temperature and humidity

182
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,560
for preserving the books as well as protective measures against theft and fire

183
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,560
What an amazing collection of books

184
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,280
A real testament to mankind, isn't it?

185
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,920
Oh, it's a testament. You're absolutely right.

186
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,140
And this is the central hall where we plan to hold the donation ceremony, with your approval.

187
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,000
The library's security will be tightened, just as Mr. Schuwald's assistant requested.

188
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,940
We want our benefactor to feel as safe as possible here.

189
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,260
Thank you. I am sure that my father will be more than happy to attend.

190
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Isn't that right, Johan?

191
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Is there something wrong?

192
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,560
No, it's nothing.

193
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
