1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:01,940
(gentle music)

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,240
- Hmm?

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,220
(chirping)

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,060
That's amazing.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,720
It'll be okay now, little bird.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,500
It's your home, I respect it.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,980
Never again will blood be shed in this forest.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,300
Isn't that right?

9
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,700
(dramatic music)

10
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,100
So, you don't remember anything?

11
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,700
I need you to take your time and try to think back to the roof.

12
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,580
Any detail you can remember about what you were doing up there would be helpful.

13
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,460
Martin, you have to tell the doctor what happened.

14
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,920
If you hadn't hit the eave on the first floor and got caught in the tree,

15
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,040
would have died, do you understand?

16
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,000
Please, Martin, just talk to the doctor.

17
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,140
If you don't, we're never going to put

18
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,780
all this foolishness behind us.

19
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,360
- Madam, do please try to stay calm.

20
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,000
- Doctor, if he were to die, I don't know what I'd,

21
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,600
I just don't.

22
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,360
- It's all right, madam.

23
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm here to see that your son gets the counseling he needs.

24
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,180
- I know, I know, it's just.

25
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,640
- Look, why don't we take this conversation outside?

26
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,760
Now Dieter, I want you to behave yourself while I'm gone, and remember you're not allowed

27
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,780
inside that room.

28
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,020
That boy, is he your grandson?

29
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,820
No, I'm just taking care of him for a while.

30
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,400
(door creaking)

31
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,040
(footsteps)

32
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,180
- Uh, hi there.

33
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,260
- Hi yourself.

34
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:16,960
- Uh.

35
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,020
- My name's Dieter.

36
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,440
- I'm Martin.

37
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,300
- Does it hurt?

38
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,560
- Does what hurt?

39
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,920
- That stuff.

40
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,160
All the cuts under your bandages.

41
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,360
When you fell off the roof,

42
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,300
I bet that was really scary for you.

43
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,800
Hey, what are you doing?

44
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,080
You shouldn't be standing up.

45
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,900
- My shoes are in that bag down there on the floor.

46
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,240
Get 'em for me.

47
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,460
- I can't.

48
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,740
You've gotta lie down.

49
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,920
Look, just get the shoes.

50
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,920
Where do you think you're going? You're gonna get yelled at.

51
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,100
Why should I care if someone yells at me?

52
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,340
It's not like I'm afraid to get yelled at.

53
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,540
It's just like he told me.

54
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,220
If you come back alive, step outside.

55
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,340
The world will be different.

56
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,760
Nah, the world didn't change.

57
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,740
I'm the one who changed.

58
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,240
You see, I'm one of the special few who've been chosen.

59
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,080
(tires screeching)

60
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,640
- I'm so bored.

61
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,840
I never realized how boring this world is.

62
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,200
Hey, look out!

63
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,380
(tires screeching)

64
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,280
(tires screeching)

65
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,740
- Come on, hurry up.

66
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,200
There's really nothing to be afraid of.

67
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,920
(grunting)

68
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,640
(grunting)

69
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,920
(grunting)

70
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,060
- What did you do that for?

71
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,380
(grunting)

72
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,120
- Check it out.

73
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,740
Look how scared this guy is.

74
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,200
- Martin, stop!

75
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,480
- No, just look at him, Dieter.

76
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,940
(grunting)

77
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,600
Help me! I don't want to die!

78
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,540
Guess you're lucky. Cause I'm gonna let you live.

79
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,640
I have an answer to that question.

80
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,180
You said you thought that falling off the roof was scary for me, right?

81
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,980
Yeah, I did.

82
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,720
Falling wasn't even a bit scary. After all, it's just a game.

83
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,960
J-just a game? But so many people have died 'cause of it!

84
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,560
Ah, but it's so much fun. Who cares about those guys?

85
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,660
Two people stand facing each other on the edge of the roof of an empty building.

86
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,640
Then you close your eyes and walk towards each other,

87
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
one step at a time.

88
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,740
It's like a duel, and it doesn't matter whether you fall or not.

89
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,300
If you survive, you win.

90
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,220
Why play a game like that?

91
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,360
You do it so that you can bet against fate.

92
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,520
Those who manage to survive are the chosen ones.

93
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,840
How can I put this in a way you'll understand?

94
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,660
The survivor gets to keep playing over and over again.

95
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,840
- Why play the game at all? - 'Cause everything else is boring, that's why.

96
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,700
But the game is real fun.

97
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,220
And the best part is playing it again once fate has made you a chosen one.

98
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,560
Don't you get it?

99
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,800
And I thought for sure that you must be one of us.

100
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,980
Fine, I'll show you.

101
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,920
If you don't get it after seeing it, then you really are stupid.

102
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,720
Hey. Hey, you're not really planning on going up to the roof, are you?

103
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,200
Yeah, 'cause I'm chosen. The Superior will always survive. Just like him.

104
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,320
Just like who?

105
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,100
The person who taught us the game, you dummy.

106
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,420
And who is that?

107
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,640
He's a friend. A friend to all the children who've been chosen.

108
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,940
Now hurry up! Get over here!

109
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,480
I don't think I want to.

110
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,280
Stop whining and come on!

111
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,180
- Let go of me!

112
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,980
- But you need to understand.

113
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,600
Those scars, who did that to you?

114
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,300
Bet it was your parents, huh?

115
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,340
Are you really gonna stay with them

116
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,860
after they did something like that?

117
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,500
You still wanna be a part of this worthless world

118
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,340
even after everything they've done to you?

119
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,620
Come on, you have to see!

120
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,020
What do you think? How's the view? How does it make you feel?

121
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:19,180
Aw, come on. There's nothing to be afraid of. Stand up, close your eyes, and take a step.

122
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,260
Stand, Dieter.

123
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,520
I understand now. I get what you've been saying. It all makes sense to me.

124
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,440
I thought the world was filled with darkness.

125
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,040
That the future would bring nothing but more misery.

126
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,040
I mean, like, what's your favorite food?

127
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,760
I ate this really good sausage the other day.

128
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,060
But if I die, I'll never get to eat it again.

129
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,080
You're such a coward.

130
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,320
I really like playing soccer.

131
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,800
If I die, I'll never get to play again.

132
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,380
And I really like Dr. Reikvein.

133
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,300
And his secretary, Ms. Merith, is nice to me.

134
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,880
If I die, I'll never see him again.

135
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,460
There are always things to be scared of.

136
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,160
Learning to deal with that is part of growing up.

137
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,640
Tenma told me tomorrow's gonna be a good day.

138
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
If I die, I won't ever get to see Tenma again.

139
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,820
I'm gonna fall!

140
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,500
Don't panic. Just don't stand up yet.

141
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,640
I can't be like him.

142
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,010
I can't be like Johan. I just can't.

143
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,340
Who did you say?

144
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,400
Johan is playing an even scarier game than this one.

145
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,440
He said that he was going to be killed soon.

146
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,780
He said that he was going to be shot by a Japanese guy.

147
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,540
I closed my eyes and I walked across the edge of the roof.

148
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,520
I'm not kidding, I really did walk it.

149
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,540
And I wasn't scared at all, you know.

150
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,400
Joachim was supposed to be walking across from me, but when I opened my eyes, he wasn't there anymore.

151
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,520
I really saw it!

152
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,500
He fell off the building and died right in front of me!

153
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,420
People really die!

154
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,240
Anyone want tea?

155
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,060
Oh, thank you.

156
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,120
Honestly, I just don't know about my son.

157
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,340
He doesn't seem to understand what he's done.

158
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,640
I'm glad he's still alive,

159
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,760
but when I think of what poor Joachim's parents are going through,

160
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,460
I just hope you manage to talk some sense into him.

161
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,600
At least he seems to listen to you.

162
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,960
She gets on my case like that every day.

163
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,800
She won't let me out of the house, or watch TV, or even read my comics.

164
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,860
Nothing's worse than boredom. I'll bring you something to help pass the time.

165
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,060
Really?

166
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,220
You may not be allowed to read comics, but a picture book should be okay.

167
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,680
Serious? A picture book? That sounds pretty stupid to me.

168
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,740
Hey, tell me about that freaky new game you said you were playing.

169
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,280
like any minute now.

170
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,040
Now that is exciting.

171
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,200
So come on, when is that Japanese guy going to shoot you?

172
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,740
Spill it, Johan.

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,040
This is very impressive.

178
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,420
Despite being the head librarian of the University of Munich

179
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,340
Friedrich Emanuel Campus Library,

180
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm simply dazzled by your collection.

181
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,240
I managed to make my way through life

182
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,300
without a proper college education.

183
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,620
I made up for this by reading every book

184
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,820
I could get a hold of.

185
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,940
Well, your decision to donate this collection

186
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,980
is a priceless gift to the university.

187
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,580
I cannot begin to express my gratitude.

188
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,720
My eyes are failing and I've lost the keen vision that reading requires.

189
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,660
I'd much rather these books be accessible to your students

190
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,760
than sitting here in my private stacks collecting dust.

191
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,440
Of course. You have a number of priceless books here,

192
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,160
but I would also prefer to make them available to the public.

193
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,160
Oh, that reminds me, we've just finished arranging storage for them.

194
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,220
And would it be possible to arrange a meeting at the library

195
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,420
to discuss holding a ceremony of some sort?

196
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,260
Well, how's the security there?

197
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,400
There are a few dangerous organizations we've had to keep an eye on ever since Mr. Schuvel re-entered public life.

198
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,840
We just want to make sure you review your guest list thoroughly.

199
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,460
Wouldn't you agree, Johan?

200
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,820
Of course.

201
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,440
It was Johan and Karl who thought up the idea of donating the collection.

202
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,860
They'll make all the necessary arrangements.

203
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,440
I'm Germont, the head librarian.

204
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,440
Pleasure to meet you.

205
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,700
The pleasure's all mine.

206
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,000
This is where we'll be storing Mr. Shuvald's collection.

207
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,180
The general public is not allowed entry.

208
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,960
You've never been here, have you?

209
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,840
Of course, we'll maintain the appropriate temperature and humidity for preserving the books,

210
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,540
as well as protective measures against theft and fire.

211
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,520
What an amazing collection of books!

212
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,280
A real testament to mankind, isn't it?

213
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,900
Oh, it's a testament. You're absolutely right.

214
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,120
And this is the central hall where we plan to hold the donation ceremony, with your approval.

215
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,040
The library's security will be tightened, just as Mr. Schuwald's assistant requested.

216
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,960
We want our benefactor to feel as safe as possible here.

217
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,260
I am sure that my father will be more than happy to attend.

218
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,880
Isn't that right, Johan?

219
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,380
Is there something wrong?

220
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,200
No, it's nothing.

221
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,860
Would you excuse me, please?

222
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,020
Are you looking for something?

223
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,540
Yes.

224
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,680
I was on the hunt for a picture book for a good friend of mine.

225
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,840
For a friend, you say?

226
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,280
Yes. For a friend in need.

227
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,840
Let's see...

228
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, I think I would recommend this one.

229
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,080
See? The illustrations are beautiful.

230
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,340
Oh, yes. Lovely.

231
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,520
But it might be just a tad too grown up.

232
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,920
Oh, I'm sorry. I assumed your friend was a bit older.

233
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,140
If that's the case, then how about this one?

234
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:35,260
Oh, how embarrassing. I'm so clumsy. This happens all the time.

235
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:46,220
Ah, how about this one? It's a beautiful book. I highly recommend it.

236
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,180
Did that one catch your eye?

237
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,480
Oh my, that is beautiful. Who's the author of this? I'm sorry, may I?

238
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:07,880
It's Emil Šerba. Moravia Publishing. It's a Czech publishing company in Prague.

239
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,520
There are quite a few talented writers publishing picture books in Czechoslovakia,

240
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,240
but I don't think I've ever heard of Scherba before.

241
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,080
Perhaps he's just not very well known.

242
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,660
Is everything all right?
