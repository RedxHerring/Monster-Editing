00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,340
So, Mr. Pedrov, oh, my mistake, your real name is Reinhard Biermann, isn't it?

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,220
There was this very special orphanage located in East Berlin, right?

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,360
It was an experimental lab where the staff did personality corrections on the children

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,220
that were housed there.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,720
It was called 511 Kinderheim, and you were the director there, Mr. Biermann.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,380
You should know all about the abuse that went on there.

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,900
Just what were you trying to achieve in those experiments back in East Berlin?

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,180
at 511 Kinderheim. Care to explain it to me?

Hey, please, wait a minute.

11
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,380
Don't rush off, Mr. Pedrov.

12
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,280
You're unique.

13
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,120
You're both a psychologist and a psychiatrist.

14
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,220
You used to work for the Internal Affairs Ministry, focusing on personality programming,

15
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,160
a form of brainwashing.

16
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,380
You see, that's what got me thinking.

17
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,460
Why would someone with your skills in behavioral modification have been appointed director of a mere orphanage?

18
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,800
I mean, certainly there were people more qualified in the field of child welfare, right?

You know, the results of your experiments at 511 Kinderheim.

24
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,760
Now, I've heard all the usual rumors that when the Berlin Wall was destroyed, a countless

25
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,460
number of secret documents disappeared, and there's a theory that they were sent to the

26
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,760
Soviet Union by train via Romania. While en route, there was a revolution in Romania,

27
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,220
the Ceausescu government fell, and supposedly the German documents were lost. But I have

28
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,780
a feeling that the data concerning 511 Kinderheim was not among those lost papers. Do you know

29
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,380
Because you, sir, are a true academic.

You're devoted to research.

Data and statistics are far more important to you scholarly types than life itself.

32

You wouldn't let go of something that important, would you?

33
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,860
I'd sure like to see that data. Must be interesting.

It must have given you so much pleasure to use children as human guinea pigs.

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,940
Your experiment... it failed, didn't it?

41
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,520
In 1985, 511 Kinderheim burned to the ground, and according to the rumors surrounding that

42
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,660
tragedy, the children of the orphanage killed each other.

43
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,660
At the time, I was no longer director of that facility.

44
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,580
The incident does not involve me at all.

45
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,680
Lucky you. You were able to escape death.

46
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,440
Now, the director right after you wasn't so lucky.

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,620
He was the first one killed in the rampage.

That catastrophe never would have occurred if I had still been there.

I assure you, my experiment was a success.

50
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,580
Oh-ho. So now it seems you're admitting to it.

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,380
You're telling me the experiment went well, so I shouldn't need proof.

Huh. You know what I think?

54
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,220
Even if many of the records went up in smoke during that fire in 1985, not everything did.

55
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:49,040
So, the experimental data from your time as director of 511 Kinderheim is still intact somewhere.
