00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
So, Mr. Pedroff. Oh, my mistake. Your real name is Reinhard Biermann, isn't it?

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,200
There was this very special orphanage located in East Berlin, right?

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,220
It was an experimental lab where the staff did personality corrections on the children that were housed there.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,720
It was called 511 Kinderheim, and you were the director there, Mr. Biermann.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,380
You should know all about the abuse that went on there.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,900
Just what were you trying to achieve in those experiments back in East Berlin?

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,140
At 511 Kinderheim, care to explain it to me?

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:23,700
We'll be right back.

12
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:29,500
Hey, please, wait a minute.

13
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,300
Don't rush off, Mr. Pedrov.

14
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,280
You're unique.

15
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,120
You're both a psychologist and a psychiatrist.

16
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,200
You used to work for the Internal Affairs Ministry,

17
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,200
focusing on personality programming,

18
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,140
a form of brainwashing.

19
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,400
You see, that's what got me thinking.

20
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,460
Why would someone with your skills in behavioral modification have been appointed director of a mere orphanage?

21
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,800
I mean, certainly there were people more qualified in the field of child welfare, right?

22
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,640
Leave me alone.

23
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

24
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,980
Just go away.

25
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,260
So, where did you hide the records?

26
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,840
You know, the results of your experiments at 511 Kinderheim.

27
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,800
Now, I've heard all the usual rumors that when the Berlin Wall was destroyed, a countless

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,820
number of secret documents disappeared.

29
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,740
And there's a theory that they were sent to the Soviet Union by train via Romania.

30
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,360
While en route, there was a revolution in Romania, the Ceaușescu government fell,

31
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,000
and supposedly the German documents were lost.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,960
But I have a feeling that the data concerning 511 Kinderheim was not among those lost papers.

33
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Do you know why I think that?

34
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Because you, sir, are a true academic.

35
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960
You're devoted to research.

36
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Data and statistics are far more important to you scholarly types than life itself.

37
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,960
You wouldn't let go of something that important, would you?

38
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,960
I'd sure like to see that data. Must be interesting.

39
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
There's nothing.

40
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,960
What were you hoping to accomplish there, at your lab at 511 Kinderheim?

41
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Go away!

42
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Your experiments, were they really successful?

43
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,960
It must have given you so much pleasure to use children as human guinea pigs.

44
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:48,940
Your experiment, it failed, didn't it?

45
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,480
In 1985, 511 Kinderheim burned to the ground.

46
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,980
And according to the rumors surrounding that tragedy,

47
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,660
the children of the orphanage killed each other.

48
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,660
At the time, I was no longer director of that facility.

49
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,600
The incident does not involve me at all.

50
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,960
I see.

51
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,680
Lucky you, you were able to escape death.

52
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,440
Now the director right after you wasn't so lucky.

53
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,620
He was the first one killed in the rampage.

54
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,140
That catastrophe never would have occurred if I had still been there.

55
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,980
I assure you, my experiment was a success.

56
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,740
Oh?

57
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,580
So now it seems you're admitting to it.

58
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,380
You're telling me the experiment went well, so I shouldn't need proof.

59
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,340
Right?

60
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,840
Huh.

61
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,200
You know what I think? Even if many of the records went up in smoke during that fire in 1985, not everything did.

62
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,040
So, the experimental data from your time as director of 511 Kinderheim is still intact somewhere.

63
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,480
Careful, you're treading on dangerous territory right now.

64
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,660
Who knows what could happen?

65
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,920
That almost sounds like a threat. You should know I'm not afraid of taking risks.

66
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,940
Get lost.

67
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,880
Sorry, but I'm going to follow you everywhere until I get the information I'm after.

68
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,000
Back off! I'm warning you not to ever come near me again! Just disappear!

69
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,500
Grandpa, we found you!

70
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,320
We've been looking for you. You were gone a long time.

71
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,260
Hey, who's that guy with you?

72
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,720
Him? Forget about him. He's nobody. Come along. Let's go home.

73
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,760
Walk away. Leave this alone.

74
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,940
Living out the remainder of his life peacefully surrounded by his grandkids,

75
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,960
to think back then he did such horrible things to children.

76
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:17,980
Who is it?

77
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,220
You have a delivery from Mr. Pedrov, sir.

78
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
Mr. Pedrov?

79
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,220
Sure.

80
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Give me a minute.

81
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:54,440
Corner rooms with a bad view are convenient, especially in moments like these.

82
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:13,260
Wow. It's been a hell of a morning. I almost didn't make it out here.

83
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,540
Yeah, a couple of strange men showed up at my hotel room.

84
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,460
Here we sit, watching your grandchildren play.

85
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,240
This is wonderful. Life is good.

86
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,580
You know, when I was working for a newspaper in old East Germany, I couldn't even dream of a moment like this.

87
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,220
Thankfully, times have changed.

88
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,920
Now, I'm a freelance journalist writing whatever I want.

89
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,040
Gosh, that was unimaginable just a few years ago back in our socialist society.

90
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,380
Being free is nice.

91
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,680
I've been watching you ever since I left the hotel. Did you know that?

92
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,060
Great home.

93
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,280
I saw you when you came out the front door and thought to myself,

94
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,680
he has a lot of space i'll bet you have nice big rooms upkeep must be difficult and rent's

95
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,000
expensive isn't it spending the whole day at a cafe taking walks and playing with your grandchildren

96
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,440
all the while maintaining this leisurely lifestyle without working

97
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,200
so i wondered where do you get the money to afford this

98
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,600
you must have sold something maybe the data to your failed experiment did you get a good price

99
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I told you it was a success.

100
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
That's all the more reason for it to get a good price.

101
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Just leave me alone. I have nothing to say to you. Now go.

102
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:02,600
There they are again. Earlier he was at the movies with those two, and now they're all eating parfait.

103
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Each time they look different.

104
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,600
One, two, three, four, five, six.

105
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:39,520
It can't be.

Hi. This is Mr. Pedrov's home, right? May I come inside?

111
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Hey there.

112
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:16,060
This is horrible.

113
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
I know what he's up to.

114
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
He's doing it again.

115
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Right here.

116
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,600
He's trying to replicate the very same experiment.

117
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
This is unconscionable.

118
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,940
How could that man do this?

119
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,860
He's trying to replicate the very same experiment from 511 Kinderheim.

120
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,400
There's a red light district at the German border.

121
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
These boys were born there, but were never nurtured.

122
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,900
And some were just abandoned by their impoverished mothers.

123
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,280
Their business fell off when the Berlin Wall came down.

124
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,760
So you just went there and gathered up all these children

125
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,340
for the purpose of continuing your 511 Kinderheim experiment here.

126
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,440
Oh, Mr. Petrov, I didn't realize you had a guest.

127
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,200
Yes. Don't worry about him. He's going home now.

128
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,220
I was planning to prepare dinner. Will Kenedleki be all right for tonight?

129
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,440
Yes. Everyone loves your Kenedleki so much that would be just perfect.

130
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:50,320
you're convinced i'm continuing with 511 kinderheim

131
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:59,220
i will tell you again i have no need to continue that experiment that project was a huge success

132
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,460
oh yeah based on what the educational program i created for the experiment

133
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,460
it shaped personalities so they were eager to absorb all kinds of knowledge

134
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,180
Educational.

135
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,540
There was nothing educational about it.

136
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,180
That was human experimentation, damn it!

137
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,600
Calm down and think about it for a moment.

138
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,700
What is the purpose of education?

139
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,660
Isn't it supposed to help people acquire knowledge and skills

140
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,680
to become useful members of society?

141
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,260
The instructor's main task is to create conditions to stimulate learning.

142
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,040
All education is an experiment.

143
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,180
At 511 Kinderheim, everyone was challenged to learn.

144
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,460
A highly advanced educational system was established.

145
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,140
You did such horrible things, and now you want to justify them?

146
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,300
Horrible things?

147
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Yes! Think about what your advanced protocols did to their minds!

148
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,380
You're a freelance writer.

149
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,140
You don't possess the scientific background to critique my procedures.

150
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,100
What's with that look?

151
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:17,980
What about the incident where the children killed each other?

152
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,380
Do you deny your experiment was the cause of that?

153
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,100
I told you. That happened after I was removed from my position as director.

154
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,800
The emergence of an unexpected anomaly threw the entire program out of control.

155
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,160
Unexpected anomaly? Like what?

156
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:48,660
Like darkness, hatred, apathy, destructive urges.

157
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,760
Unfortunately, people easily succumb to these negative forces.

158
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,320
Once they get in, they're hard to stop.

159
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,980
And soon they possessed all of 511 Kinderheim.

160
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,060
Yes, one boy arrived and all that began.

161
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,800
I suppose next you're going to tell me that didn't have anything to do with you.

162
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,240
As I keep telling you, the experiment was very successful.

163
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,860
That's a lie and you know it.

164
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,180
All those children at 511 Kinderheim shared a common character flaw.

165
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,600
There was one thing they could not do.

166
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,640
They were incapable of loving.

167
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,920
An interesting comment.

168
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,100
Now then, our little chat is over, and I would like you to leave.

169
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,440
Don't even think of telling anyone about this place.

170
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,660
Sorry, you're breaking one of this country's laws.

171
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,680
I have to report this to the police.

172
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,580
I think you're forgetting you're not in Germany anymore.

173
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,980
The Czech Republic is a democracy.

174
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,080
They frown upon things like an unauthorized orphanage with an unlicensed director.

175
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,240
You want to make a deal.

176
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,300
That's what this is all about.

177
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,720
You're offering to not report me if I cooperate.

178
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,640
And I give you all the data from my experiment.

179
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,480
- All right, let's go.

180
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,140
- What are you planning to do?

181
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,420
- You guys want to play some soccer?

182
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,260
- Yeah!

183
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,040
- Well, what are we waiting for?

184
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,420
- Where do you think you're going with the boys?

185
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,940
- Oh, didn't you hear?

186
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,740
We're going out to play some soccer.

187
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:45,460
Listen up, everyone.

188
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,900
Mr. Petrov and I are sort of working out a deal,

189
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,520
and I want you guys to help me make the right decision in this matter

190
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,200
because it concerns all of you.

191
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,460
If I reported him to the proper authorities,

192
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,420
then you'd all be free to go.

193
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,220
I mean, you'd like to leave, wouldn't you?

194
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:15,160
but you'd have more freedom out of there don't you

195
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,960
happy faces

196
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:52,560
how can they be so genuinely happy

197
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,100
impossible

198
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:31,640
Wow, what a beautiful lady.

199
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,720
Yeah.

200
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,340
Petrov, I need to know

201
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,340
I don't know if you altered the pro-

202
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,340
What happened?

203
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Mr. Petrov!

204
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,340
Get off the floor! Mrs. Adams, please!

205
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Mr. Petrov!

206
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,340
Can you hear me?

207
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:31,500
hear me! Grandpa's hurt! Mr. Pedroff, tell me who shot you! What's wrong with you? Woman. Woman? Grandpa, please are you alright? What happened? What happened to you? Oh no! Grandpa, you're bleeding! Mr. Pedroff, please tell me, did you alter the program this time?

208
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:40,180
The key, the key, the card, and the secret code number.

209
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,320
You'll find them hidden behind the third drawer of my desk.

210
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,320
They're for my safe deposit box, where the experiment data and tape can be found.

211
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,420
What tape?

212
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,560
of an interview with a certain boy

213
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,640
recalling his past

214
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,840
under the use of chemically induced hypnotism.

215
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,620
That boy is the malevolent monster.

216
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,700
His darkness and evil influence

217
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,680
led 511 Kinderheim to destruction.

218
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:27,020
so now what do you think are these children lacking anything in their development

219
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:35,020
mr pedroff i don't know but it appears you educated them differently than those in 511

220
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:45,120
one kinderheim apathy hatred destructive urges dark forces i wanted them to repel but how could

221
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:57,980
i do that what would make them resistant it was love yes it was that's the new discovery i factored

222
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,980
Mr. Pedroff, love isn't any new discovery.

223
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,980
Parents give it to their children all the time.

224
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,980
It was an experiment.
