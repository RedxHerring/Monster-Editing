Remember, Vim. When things are at their worst, the Magnificent Steiner will show up and save the day.

182
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,720
I saw a few cases of that during my experiments years ago.

183
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:50,660
By exposing a child to excessive stress from anger or sadness, a child will manifest a different personality.

184
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,160
Those children were exceptionally violent creatures.

185
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,340
Almost all of them took their own lives.

186
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm surprised that you haven't.

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,980
I'm alone and I'm unarmed.

A minute of your time, that's all I'm asking for.

189
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,420
You're not here because you want to be, isn't that right?

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,500
just a nobody from nowhere! Are any of you listening to a single word I'm saying?

192
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,600
Don't just follow orders! You're men, not machines! In your hearts, you know what's right!

193
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,940
The answer is sitting there waiting for you! Are you brave enough to look inside yourselves?

194
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,420
Well, are you?

195
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,460
I think you are.

00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,520
I was so frightened, but I made it over here after all.

realized that his anger transformed him

Just a little bit further and we'll be out of these woods.

224
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,460
- You came from Ruinheim, didn't you?

00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,400
How did you know?

Something's happening in your town, right?

Bunch of folks I'd never seen before showed up with weapons.

228
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,300
Everyone in town started killing each other.

You're not with those guys, are you?

230

Then you did see him.

234
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,620
Yeah. He was doing his damnedest to get these kids out of harm's way.

235
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,940
He's still back there, making sure they all get to safety.

236
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,820
When we split up, he said he was headed to the Hotel Versteck.

You can't go back there! They'll shoot you dead!

Maybe so, but that Japanese man is my friend, Kenzo Tenma.

And that one I threw out the window.

As a matter of fact, Steiner never did show up.

I did it all on my own.

Almost slipped my mind.

Take it. It's a letter.

262
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,220
I got it from Inspector Lungay. He found it back in the Red Rose Mansion.

263
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,880
You gotta... you gotta go help him. He headed to the Hotel Bergbach by himself.

Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Tenma?

- I would.

275
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,940
- When the rain lets up, we should take Vim on a picnic.

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,460
- All right.

- Yeah.

- I'm crying.

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,820
But it's not because I feel my life fading away.

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,600
These tears are streaming down my face

283
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,700
because I'm crying for my son.

You can't just erase people's feelings.

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,360
It's as if my emotions were lost somewhere

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:03,620
It's as if they were sent long ago in a letter that was always intended for me.

288
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,880
So this is what true sadness feels like.

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,100
It feels a lot like happiness.
