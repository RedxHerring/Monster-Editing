Please help me escape I have to warn the others or my baby will die too I overheard them talking

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,640

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:29,980
part of town help me please help me they're all going to die if I don't warn them

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
(sobbing)

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,280
(choral music)

6
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,300
(upbeat music)

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,440
(dramatic music)

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,840
- Hey, kid, where the hell are you going?

9
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,260
Come on. Give me a break leaving that rug in this town is a complete waste that guy doesn't know what it's worth

10
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,340
How many times do I got to tell you stop looking at me like that slimeball

11
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,520
Yeah, see if I care don't come crying to me when you're starving and I'm living like a king

12
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,840
And if you tell anybody about this you're gonna pay for you got that

13
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,520
Who would want to be friends with a dirty thief like him anyway, I don't need him

14
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm so hungry right now.

15
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,180
There, there.

16
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,940
Don't cry.

17
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,880
Be a good boy.

18
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,560
Mommy's coming back soon.

19
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,300
I promise.

20
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,360
What's wrong?

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,420
Doesn't he have a mom?

22
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,120
Huh?

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,500
Of course he does.

24
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,580
What about you?

25
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,160
What are you doing sitting here alone?

26
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,540
You should go home to your mom.

27
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,000
Huh?

28
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,520
What's wrong?

29
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,860
- Wait a sec, you don't have a mom to go home to.

30
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,320
Hey, I'm sorry if what I said hurt your feelings, kid.

31
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,740
- It's all right, I've got Tenma.

32
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,020
- Tenma?

33
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,460
(Tenma growling)

34
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,780
Eat as much as you want, it's nothing special,

35
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,500
but don't feel like you gotta hold back.

36
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,080
So you were just sitting on those steps

37
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,880
waiting for that Tenma guy to come back and get you, huh?

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That little guy's waiting, too.

39
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,120
Where's his mom? Why'd she leave? Where'd she go?

40
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,160
A bunch of bad guys came and took her away.

41
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
We gotta save her!

42
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,380
It's just so dangerous out there.

43
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,140
An Asian man I met said he was gonna try and help her,

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,600
but then he got hit by a car right in front of me.

45
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,480
An Asian man?

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,740
Wait, you said Tenma was Japanese, didn't you?

47
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,760
But there's no way it could be the same person, could it?

48
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,100
Where are they I've got to help them

49
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,400
The man who hired me he was a right-wing fanatic cool and sadistic

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,660
After he beat me I left but I forgot my scarf so I had to go back

51
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,900
That's when I heard him talking on the phone. I heard him say that I'm going to burn the entire town tomorrow

52
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:25,420
I ran away as fast as I could to warn everyone about the fire, but they caught me

53
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,980
Please you must help me

54
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,300
My baby! I don't want my baby to die!

55
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,540
Please, you must help me!

56
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,380
Who is it?

57
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,720
Professor Giedlitz has asked me to bring you some fruit.

58
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,360
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,560
The professor also asked me to deliver a message.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
General Wolf will be here shortly and would like to meet with you.

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,860
You mean the man in the photograph with my brother?

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,920
That's right. General Wolf is the person who knows Johan better than anyone, probably even more than you do, even though you're his twin sister.

63
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,760
That's what Professor Giedlitz said.

64
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,580
Now don't go dying on me just yet. General Wolf's going to be here any minute.

65
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,480
And I want him to see what a wonderful job I've done of capturing you alive.

66
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,780
Wolf, you say?

67
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,420
That's general to you, do you understand?

68
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,200
You should search out a General Wolf.

69
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,200
He's the one who first discovered Johan and his abilities.

70
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,400
Receiving praise from General Wolf is an absolute dream come true for anyone.

71
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,700
Excuse me, sir. We've assembled our members and the arson teams ready to set fire to the Turkish quarter.

72
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,220
Shall we continue with the plan as scheduled?

73
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm looking forward to dinner with a view of a beautiful crimson sky.

74
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,760
Be sure everything stays on schedule, otherwise my perfect dinner will be ruined.

75
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,700
And tell them that if anything goes wrong, forgiveness will come at a very high price.

76
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,440
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,920
He won't do it. Yohan isn't going to lead you.

78
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,120
You'll never be able to convince Yohan to lead your organization. Are you out of your mind?

79
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,360
"Yohan doesn't share your simple-minded views on racial purity.

80
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,020
He's not just an ignorant bigot like all of you.

81
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,520
He's different, don't you see?

82
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,480
He looks down on all humanity."

83
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,520
"SILENCE!"

84
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,160
"Well, well, what do we have here?

85
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,340
and a drink on me, I'm thinking the usual.

86
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,460
- Right away.

87
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,920
(laughing)

88
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,880
- Damn.

89
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,480
- Wow.

90
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,580
- Damn kid.

91
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,460
- Not bad for a little guy.

92
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,180
There's going to be serious trouble when he grows up.

93
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,820
That was disgusting. How can they drink that stuff?

94
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,220
This is Tenma's jacket.

95
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,760
Tenma?

96
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,960
Tenma, where are you?

97
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:50,900
(footsteps)

98
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,600
- Tenma?

99
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,220
Everything will be all right.

100
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,420
Just calm down.

101
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,360
I want to help you get out of here,

102
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,900
but I can't really do anything right now.

103
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,140
I'm going to sneak out of here,

104
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,080
and I'll warn everybody in your neighborhood.

105
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,500
I promise you.

106
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,540
- Oh, thank you.

107
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,640
- Tell me, what's the name of the street?

108
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,780
- Calvin Street.

109
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,680
- Calvin Street.

110
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,980
And what's your name?

111
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,140
- My name?

112
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,460
It is Aishe.

113
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:27,380
I don't want you to worry about anything. Okay, I promise you your baby is going to be just fine. I'm gonna save you, too

114
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
Hang in there

115
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,340
Bless you. Oh

116
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:38,860
I forgot to ask your name Nina and when this is over. I hope we get to know each other better

117
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,080
Nina

118
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,820
I've had so many bad things happen to me since I came to Germany. You are the first good person. I've met

119
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,640
We are friends, isn't that right?

120
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:52,720
Mm-hmm.

121
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
Aishe, I forgot to ask you.

122
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,460
What's your baby's name?

123
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,400
Hey, Aishe.

124
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,480
Are you there?

125
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,280
What's happening?

126
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,200
Leave her alone!

127
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,960
Aishe...

128
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,040
(eerie music)

129
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,860
(gasps)

130
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,040
(panting)

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:40,940
(panting)

132
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,680
(eerie music)

133
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,160
Tell me, is the man sitting in that chair Dr. Tenma?

134
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,320
Yes, it is.

135
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,900
And I captured him with my very own hands.

136
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,020
So, where is General Wolfe?

137
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,100
General Wolfe is waiting.

138
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,100
We'll be taking the doctor to him.

139
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,720
Huh?

140
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,100
What?

141
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,940
No, wait.

142
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,980
What do you mean?

143
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,180
But I wanted to show General Wolfe my prize catch and then finish him off myself.

144
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,200
What do you want me to do with this kid?

145
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,940
I found him walking around downstairs looking for Tenma.

146
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,000
Is this a friend of yours?

147
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,300
No, of course not. That child has nothing to do with this. Just let him go.

148
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,720
You don't really expect me to take a filthy street urchin like this to General Wolf, do you?

149
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,360
Dispose of him.

150
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,240
He's just a boy!

151
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,720
You heard me. Finish him off. Go ahead.

152
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,040
Got the little brat already. He bothers me.

153
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,760
Yes, sir.

154
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,860
Stop! No!

155
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,860
It was one of my men!

156
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,200
My apologies, Doctor. Please forgive us for the rude treatment you've received.

157
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,960
It's very important to General Wolfe that you be treated as his guest.

158
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,220
Poor Aishe...

159
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,700
Please, help me escape, I have to warn the others or my baby will die too.

160
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,000
We are friends, isn't that right?

161
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,120
Yes, we are, Aishe.

162
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,620
We are friends.

163
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,240
What happened here?

164
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,680
Professor Kievlitz...

165
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,420
Everybody's... everybody's dead...

166
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,440
We should be arriving at General Wolfe's mansion momentarily, Dr. Tenma.

167
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,120
Tell me, is Nina going to be there?

168
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,860
Yes, you can rest assured.

169
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,440
She is also considered to be a special guest of General Wolfe.

170
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,740
What about the Turkish lady, the baby's mom?

171
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,740
I don't know. We don't know anything at all.

172
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,780
We simply follow orders and nothing else.

173
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,780
We gotta go back to town.

174
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,880
Calvin Street is going to burn tonight. We gotta go back.

175
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,300
The lady who gave me dinner last night and the baby are going to die!

176
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,720
They're all going to die!

177
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,280
Be that as it may, young man, I can't let you go.

178
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,200
We must take you to General Wolf's mansion.

179
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,740
Pull over now.

180
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,220
All right!

181
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,540
Think you can make it to the Turkish quarter on your own?

182
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll be there soon, but right now it's important that I go with these men.

183
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,860
But I...

184
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,940
You can do it. I know you can.

185
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:41,260
able to save everyone on Calvin Street. Go on, hurry! From here you should be able to

186
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:51,280
get to the city in thirty minutes. I apologize, but I had to do that. I had no choice. Now

187
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,480
I know you trusted me enough to give me back my gun, and I may have just broken that trust,

188
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,760
but it didn't seem like you were going to stop otherwise. It's fine. I'm sure General

189
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,260
General Wolfe will be pleased to know that you don't just carry your gun around for show

190
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,240
and that you're not afraid to use it when needed.

191
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,060
If you would please follow me.

192
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,820
Where's Nina?

193
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,880
I want to see her.

194
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,120
She is here, isn't she?

195
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,700
Patience.

196
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,660
Before we do anything else, we must see General Wolfe and Professor Giedlitz.

197
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,920
I just need to know for myself that she's safe.

198
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,300
Professor Giedlitz is dead.

199
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,760
And it's not just Giedlitz.

200
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,780
All of his men have also been killed.

201
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,600
We've disposed of the bodies.

202
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,640
Everything's been taken care of.

203
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,220
What about Nina?

204
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,340
When we first arrived with General Wolfe,

205
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,100
we searched the entire mansion.

206
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,920
She was nowhere to be found.

207
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,080
You're Dr. Tenma, correct?

208
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,020
Wait, do I know you?

209
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,820
You wouldn't recognize me, even if you saw my face.

210
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,700
I don't recognize me, but people call me Wolf.

211
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,920
Wolf? That means that you...

212
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,180
You don't look anything like the picture from ten years ago.

213
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
That's because...

214
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,140
Fear has aged me.

215
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,360
Sir, please hurry. Can't you go any faster?

216
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,020
You're crazy. I'm pushing 200 here.

217
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,260
There's no way. That speedometer must be broken.

218
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,960
There's no way I'm going to make it in time.

219
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,680
I think people's names are very interesting, mysterious even.

220
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,060
All the places I've been throughout my life,

221
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,560
Everybody has referred to me as "Wulff".

222
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,380
On the other hand, every time I encounter someone new,

223
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,560
I must tell them that my name is "Wulff".

224
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,620
I wonder, how can they really know that is me?

225
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,860
What's there to prove that I really am "Wulff"?

226
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,560
You're the one who found Johan and his sister, isn't that right?

227
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,120
I did. It happened twelve years ago.

228
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,140
And that's when he was sent to 5-1-1 Kinderheim.

229
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,080
They were going to turn him into a super soldier, weren't they?

230
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,620
But you had bigger plans for him.

231
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,980
That's correct.

232
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,140
He was supposed to become our country's savior before its downfall.

233
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,200
And now you're trying to make sure he becomes the next Adolf Hitler

234
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,340
so that he can lead the ultra-nationalists.

235
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,260
Isn't that your plan?

236
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,560
At the moment, I'm only part of this organization because it benefits me.

237
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,020
I did hear that the others are trying to make him into another Hitler.

238
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,760
I think it's a stupid idea.

239
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,640
Imagine, if a man like Hitler was able to take things as far as he did,

240
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,480
Johan could do more.

241
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,820
Yes, I was the one who gave him the name Johan.

242
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,240
We found the twins wandering near the Czech border.

243
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,320
They had managed to evade the heavy security patrol somehow.

244
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,420
They were dead on their feet,

245
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,820
malnourished and almost frozen to death.

246
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,220
When we finally arrived, the two of them simply collapsed.

247
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,840
They both would have perished

248
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,240
if we hadn't found them when we did.

249
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,860
I, too, know what it's like to have saved Johan's life.

250
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,420
When he regained consciousness, I asked him a simple question.

251
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,580
"How do you feel?" I asked.

252
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,800
And do you know what his reply was?

253
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,820
He said, "You will know very soon."

254
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,520
And now there's no more proof I really am Wolf.

255
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,500
All the people who knew me have disappeared.

256
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,180
My wife, children, siblings, relatives, friends.

257
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,260
Everybody from my life is dead.

258
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,320
All of them died, one by one.

259
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,220
The money I brought with me back from East Germany

260
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,740
is the only proof I have that my name is Wolf.

261
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,280
Because of Johann, I am a stranger to all.

262
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,660
You will know very soon.

263
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,460
Now I understand what he meant.

264
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,120
Loneliness.

265
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,800
Take a look at this.

266
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:14,220
Come to the abandoned warehouse of Hilden and Engel's company in Rombach.

267
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,980
Johan was here this morning.

268
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,840
He came here to slaughter Gielitz and his men.

269
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,440
Yet another person who knew me has been murdered.

270
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,480
I imagine Nina must have seen this and gone there to look for him.

271
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,220
Please kill him. I beg of you.

272
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,920
Calm down, kid. What are you talking about?

273
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,720
Calvin Street is going to burn tonight!

274
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,460
We have to hurry and tell everyone!

275
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,580
I can't believe this!

276
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,960
This is amazing! It must be my lucky day!

277
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,380
This is great!

278
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,440
Now I can grab that rug during the fire!

279
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,580
What a score!

280
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,420
How can you think that way?

281
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,140
Keep it down, you little brat!

282
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,160
about this I swear oh hey let me go listen kid I'm not just talking about

283
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,860
all those Turks okay if any of the right-wingers find out what we know

284
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,640
we're dead what you didn't notice all the guys with their freaking swastika

285
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,820
tattoos around here

286
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,620
I said...

287
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,120
One more question.

288
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,860
Was a Turkish woman being held hostage in there?

289
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,840
We found a dead woman on the third floor.

290
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,720
Based on what we saw, I don't think Johann killed her.

291
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,540
Looked like it was the work of Professor Giedlitz's men.

292
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,360
Well, General Worf, do you really think he'll be able to kill Johan?

293
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,280
I don't know. However, he still has time he may be able to.

294
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,180
What is this supposed to mean?
