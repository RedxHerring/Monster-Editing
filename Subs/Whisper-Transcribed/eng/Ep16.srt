1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,540
Please, help me escape. I have to warn the others or my baby will die too.

2
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,400
I overheard them talking. They're going to burn it all down tomorrow night.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,560
They're going to destroy the Turkish part of town.

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,020
Help me. Please help me.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,980
They're all going to die if I don't warn them.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
- No, no, no, no, no.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:29,980
We'll be right back.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:59,980
We'll see you next time.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,040

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,040

13
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,900

14
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,420

15
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:48,980
I'm so hungry right now they're there don't cry be a good boy mommy's coming

16
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,100

17
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
What about you? What are you doing sitting here alone?

18
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,100
You should go home to your mom.

19
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,100
Wait a sec. You don't have a mom to go home to.

20
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,100
Hey, I'm sorry if what I said hurt your feelings, kid.

21
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
It's alright. I've got tenma.

22
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
Tenma?

23
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,100
Eat as much as you want. It's nothing special, but don't feel like you gotta hold back.

24
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,880
So you were just sitting on those steps waiting for that Tenma guy to come back and get you, huh?

25
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,960
That little guy's waiting, too.

26
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,100
Where's his mom? Why'd she leave? Where'd she go?

27
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,160
A bunch of bad guys came and took her away.

28
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,380
We gotta save her!

29
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,380
It's just so dangerous out there.

30
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,620
An Asian man I met said he was gonna try and help her, but then he got hit by a car right in front of me.

31
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,480
An Asian man?

32
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,740
Wait, you said Tenma was Japanese, didn't you?

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,760
But there's no way it could be the same person, could it?

34
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,880
Where are they? I've got to help them!

35
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,360
The man who hired me, he was a right-wing fanatic, cool and sadistic.

36
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,740
After he beat me, I left.

37
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,620
But I forgot my scarf, so I had to go back.

38
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,720
That's when I heard him talking on the phone.

39
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,900
I heard him say that I'm going to burn the entire town tomorrow.

40
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:25,500
I ran away as fast as I could to warn everyone about the fire, but they caught me.

41
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,940
Please, you must help me.

42
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,280
My baby. I don't want my baby to die.

43
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,560
Please, you must help me.

44
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,380
Who is it?

45
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,720
Professor Giedlitz has asked me to bring you some fruit.

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
Thank you very much.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
The professor also asked me to deliver a message.

48
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,000
General Wolf will be here shortly and would like to meet with you.

49
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,880
You mean the man in the photograph with my brother?

50
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,080
That's right.

51
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,420
General Wolf is the person who knows Johan better than anyone.

52
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,900
Probably even more than you do, even though you're his twin sister.

53
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,760
That's what Professor Giedlitz said.

54
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,960
Now don't go dying on me just yet.

55
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,580
General Wolf's going to be here any minute.

56
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,480
And I want him to see what a wonderful job I've done of capturing you alive.

57
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,800
Wolf, you say?

58
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,320
That's general to you, do you understand?

59
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,200
You should search out a General Wolf.

60
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,160
He's the one who first discovered Johan and his abilities.

61
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,540
Receiving praise from General Wolf is an absolute dream come true for anyone.

62
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,700
Excuse me, sir. We've assembled our members and the arson teams ready to set fire to the Turkish quarter.

63
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,220
Shall we continue with the plan as scheduled?

64
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:00,160
Yes, proceed with the itinerary. I'm looking forward to dinner with a view of a beautiful crimson sky.

65
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,700
Be sure everything stays on schedule, otherwise my perfect dinner will be ruined.

66
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,700
And tell them that if anything goes wrong, forgiveness will come at a very high price.

67
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,460
Yes, sir.

68
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,920
He won't do it. Johan isn't going to lead you.

69
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,440
Oh?

70
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,820
You'll never be able to convince Johan to lead your organization.

71
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,120
Are you out of your mind?

72
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,340
Johan doesn't share your simple-minded views on racial purity.

73
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,020
He's not just an ignorant bigot like all of you.

74
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,520
He's different, don't you see?

75
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,300
He looks down on all humanity.

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,560
Silence!

77
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,160
Well, well, what do we have here?

78
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,340
Hey, get this gentleman a drink on me. I'm thinking the usual.

79
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,460
Right away.

80
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:22,520
damn well not bad for a little guy that kid's gonna be serious trouble when he grows up

81
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,880
that was disgusting how can they drink that stuff

82
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,180
this is tenma's jacket

83
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,800
tenma

84
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,000
Tenma? Tenma, where are you?

85
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,620
Tenma?

86
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,420
Everything will be all right. Just calm down.

87
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,900
I want to help you get out of here, but I can't really do anything right now.

88
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,500
I'm going to sneak out of here, and I'll warn everybody in your neighborhood. I promise you.

89
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,540
Oh, thank you.

90
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,660
Tell me, what's the name of the street?

91
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,820
Calvin Street.

92
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,980
Calvin Street. And what's your name?

93
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,380
My name? It is Aishe.

94
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,520
Aishe, I don't want you to worry about anything, okay?

95
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,660
I promise you, your baby is going to be just fine.

96
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,300
I'm gonna save you, too.

97
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,000
Hang in there.

98
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,560
Bless you.

99
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,520
Oh, I forgot to ask your name.

100
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,720
Nina. And when this is over, I hope we get to know each other better.

101
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,800
Nina, I've had so many bad things happen to me since I came to Germany.

102
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,820
You are the first good person I've met.

103
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,640
We are friends, isn't that right?

104
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,680
Mm-hmm.

105
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,460
Aishe, I forgot to ask you, what's your baby's name?

106
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,460
Hey, Aishe, are you there?

107
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,280
What's happening?

108
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Leave her alone!

109
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Aishe...

110
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:48,720
♪♪

111
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:58,740
♪♪

112
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:06,740
♪♪

113
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:30,160
Tell me, is the man sitting in that chair Dr. Tenma?

114
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
Yes, it is.

115
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,900
And I captured him with my very own hands.

116
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,160
So, where is General Wolf?

117
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,120
General Wolf is waiting. We'll be taking the doctor to him.

118
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,980
Huh? What? No, wait. What do you mean?

119
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,220
But I wanted to show General Wolf my prize catch and then finish him off myself.

120
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,200
So what do you want me to do with this kid?

121
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,920
I found him walking around downstairs looking for Tenma.

122
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,020
Oh, is he a friend of yours?

123
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,300
No, of course not. That child has nothing to do with this. Just let him go.

124
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,720
You don't really expect me to take a filthy street urchin like this to General Wolfe, do you?

125
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,380
Dispose of him.

126
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,260
He's just a boy!

127
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,960
You heard me. Finish him off.

128
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,060
Go ahead, gut the little brat already. He bothers me.

129
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,780
Yes, sir.

130
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,720
Stop! No!

131
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:47,940
That was one of my men!

132
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,820
My apologies, Doctor.

133
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,740
Please forgive us for the rude treatment you've received.

134
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,040
It's very important to General Vulf that you be treated as his guest.

135
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:13,660
Poor Aishe.

136
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,480
Please, help me escape.

137
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,680
I have to warn the others or my baby will die too.

138
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:35,020
We are friends, isn't that right?

139
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,100
Yes, we are, Aishe.

140
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,520
We are friends.

141
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,240
What happened here?

142
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:15,580
Professor Kietlitz.

143
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,840
Everybody's... everybody's dead.

144
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,400
We should be arriving at General Vulf's mansion momentarily, Dr. Tenma.

145
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,140
Tell me, is Nina going to be there?

146
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,860
Yes, you can rest assured.

147
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,420
She is also considered to be a special guest of General Vulf.

148
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,740
What about the Turkish lady, the baby's mom?

149
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,680
I don't know.

150
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,720
We don't know anything at all.

151
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,780
We simply follow orders and nothing else.

152
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,820
We gotta go back to town

153
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,860
Calvin Street is going to burn tonight

154
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,880
We gotta go back

155
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,300
We have to let them know

156
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Or the lady who gave me dinner last night and the baby are going to die

157
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,760
They're all going to die

158
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,520
Be that as it may, young man

159
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,300
I can't let you go

160
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,240
We must take you to General Wolf's mansion

161
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,800
Pull over now

162
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,320
All right

163
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,560
Think you can make it to the Turkish quarter on your own?

164
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll be there soon, but right now it's important that I go with these men.

165
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,860
But I...

166
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,940
You can do it. I know you can.

167
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,280
If you go right now, you'll be able to save everyone on Calvin Street.

168
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,220
Go on, hurry!

169
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,660
From here, you should be able to get to the city in 30 minutes.

170
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,040
I apologize, but I had to do that. I had no choice.

171
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,740
Now, I know you trusted me enough to give me back my gun,

172
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,480
and I may have just broken that trust,

173
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,820
but it didn't seem like you were going to stop otherwise.

174
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,300
It's fine.

175
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,080
I'm sure General Wolf will be pleased to know

176
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,260
that you don't just carry your gun around for show

177
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,120
and that you're not afraid to use it when needed.

178
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,100
If you would please follow me.

179
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,880
Where's Nina? I want to see her.

180
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,140
She is here, isn't she?

181
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:21,820
Patience.

182
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,260
Before we do anything else,

183
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,780
Because we must see General Vulf and Professor Giedlitz.

184
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,500
I just need to know for myself that she's safe.

185
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,300
Professor Giedlitz is dead.

186
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,640
And it's not just Giedlitz.

187
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,400
All of his men have also been killed.

188
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,460
We've disposed of the bodies.

189
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,720
Everything's been taken care of.

190
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
What about Nina?

191
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,800
When we first arrived with General Vulf, we searched the entire mansion.

192
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,600
She was nowhere to be found.

193
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
You're Dr. Tenma, correct?

194
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,000
Wait, do I know you?

195
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,820
You wouldn't recognize me, even if you saw my face.

196
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,700
I don't recognize me, but people call me Wolf.

197
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,700
Wolf? That means that you...

198
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,200
You don't look anything like the picture from ten years ago.

199
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,760
That's because...

200
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,140
Fear has aged me.

201
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,360
Sir, please hurry. Can't you go any faster?

202
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,060
You're crazy. I'm pushing 200 here.

203
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,260
There's no way. That speedometer must be broken.

204
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,960
There's no way I'm gonna make it in time.

205
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,660
I think people's names are very interesting. Mysterious, even.

206
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,060
All the places I've been throughout my life,

207
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,300
everybody has referred to me as Wolf.

208
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,380
On the other hand, every time I encounter someone new,

209
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,320
I must tell them that my name is Wolf.

210
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,620
I wonder, how can they really know that is me?

211
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,440
What's there to prove that I really am Wolf?

212
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,720
You're the one who found Johan and his sister.

213
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,580
Isn't that right?

214
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,100
I did. It happened 12 years ago.

215
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,140
And that's when he was sent to 511 Kinderheim.

216
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,080
They were going to turn him into a super soldier, weren't they?

217
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,580
But you had bigger plans for him.

218
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,980
That's correct.

219
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,140
He was supposed to become our country's savior before its downfall.

220
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,180
And now you're trying to make sure he becomes the next Adolf Hitler

221
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,360
so that he can lead the ultra-nationalists.

222
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,280
Isn't that your plan?

223
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,580
At the moment, I'm only part of this organization because it benefits me.

224
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,020
I did hear that the others are trying to make him into another Hitler.

225
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,800
I think it's a stupid idea.

226
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,640
Imagine, if a man like Hitler was able to take things as far as he did,

227
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,440
Johann could do more.

228
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,520
Yes, I was the one who gave him the name Johann.

229
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,580
We found the twins wandering near the Czech border.

230
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,580
They had managed to evade heavy security patrol somehow.

231
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:36,580
They were dead on their feet, malnourished and almost frozen to death.

232
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,580
When we finally arrived, the two of them simply collapsed.

233
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,580
They both would have perished if we hadn't found them when we did.

234
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,880
I, too, know what it's like to have saved Johan's life.

235
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,420
When he regained consciousness, I asked him a simple question.

236
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,580
How do you feel, I asked.

237
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,960
And do you know what his reply was?

238
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,560
He said, you will know very soon.

239
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:21,500
and now there's no more proof i really am wolf all the people who knew me have disappeared

240
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:31,280
my wife children siblings relatives friends everybody from my life is dead

241
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,340
all of them died one by one i have johan to thank for that

242
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:47,840
the money i brought with me back from east germany is the only proof i have that my name is wolf

243
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:59,500
because of johann i am a stranger to all you will know very soon now i understand what he meant

244
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:06,320
loneliness take a look at this doctor

245
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:14,180
Come to the abandoned warehouse of Hilden and Engel's company in Romberg.

246
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,960
Johan was here this morning.

247
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,860
He came here to slaughter Gielitz and his men.

248
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,440
Yet another person who knew me has been murdered.

249
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,480
I imagine Nina must have seen this and gone there to look for him.

250
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,120
Please kill him. I beg of you

251
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,660
Calm down kid. What are you talking about?

252
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,320
Calvin Street is going to burn tonight. We have to hurry and tell everyone

253
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,680
I can't believe this. This is amazing. It must be my lucky day. Huh? This is great now

254
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
I can grab that rug during the fire

255
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,260
What a score how can you think that way?

256
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,960
keep it down you little brat if you tell anyone about this I swear oh hey let me

257
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,540
go listen kid I'm not just talking about all those Turks okay if any of the right

258
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,620
wingers find out what we know we're dead what you didn't notice all the guys with

259
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:34,720
freaking swastika tattoos around here one more question was a Turkish woman

260
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,600
being held hostage in there we found a dead woman on the third floor based on

261
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,300
what we saw I don't think Johan killed her looked like it was the work of

262
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:49,620
Professor Giedlitz men well general wolf do you really think he'll be able to

263
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:58,020
kill Johan I don't know however he still has time he may be able to

264
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:23,200
What is this supposed to mean?
