1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
and you haven't touched a drink since is that correct absolutely not even a drop well that's

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,140
very good but you have to continue to stay away from booze to give yourself the chance to start

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,000
over there's no way I'm gonna drink as long as I report to you once a week I don't want to incur

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,520
your wrath yeah just the thought of it makes me afraid what are you talking about I always conduct

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,280
myself in a very calm professional manner I was kidding I don't have time to drink anyway I got

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,660
my first big case since becoming a private investigator.

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,480
- Well, that's very good news.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,820
- Dr. Reifein, how would you judge this fellow?

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,200
- What do you mean?

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,980
- Using your knowledge of physiognomy,

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,140
I thought maybe you could tell me

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,960
what kind of young man appears in this photograph.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,060
- I don't practice physiognomy.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,820
Richard, I'm afraid you're mistaking me

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,900
for some kind of quack fortune teller or weirdo psychic.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,420
- But you have a well-acknowledged reputation.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,820
You're able to predict someone's behavioral traits

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,640
from just a single glance, right?

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,880
That's the result of many years of accumulating information from observing patients.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Then can you use all of those years of acquired wisdom to tell me if this guy looks like a con man?

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,240
Con man?

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,840
That's not possible.

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,280
A man with a face like his couldn't fool anyone.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,820
Even if he tried some kind of con, he'd be easily found out.

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,780
Uh-huh.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,600
What are the odds that he'd commit suicide?

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,700
Absolutely none at all.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,940
People with faces like his would never kill themselves.

29
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,820
Well, I must say, Doctor, your observations seem to be pretty convincing and give me quite a lot to think about.

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,880
And they're based on experience. So, who hired you, if you don't mind my asking?

31
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,780
Hans Georg Schuwald.

32
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,960
You're working for Schuwald?

33
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,600
I take it you know who he is, am I right?

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,640
Yes, I'm quite familiar with him. He's the wealthy vampire of Bavaria.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,400
Well, that immensely rich gentleman is my client, and the young man in the photograph is Edmund Farran,

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,940
An impersonator who actually passed himself off as Shuvald's son for a while.

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,040
Hmm. He eventually gave himself away?

38
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,780
Not really. Mr. Shuvald bought every detail of his deception.

39
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,500
He wasn't your typical run-of-the-mill scam artist, you know?

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,180
I myself had a lot of trouble figuring out he was a complete fraud.

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,240
Even now, some pieces of the mystery about him still remain.

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,380
How did Farin know so much about Shuvald's missing son?

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,300
Where did he get the information, and who supplied it?

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,360
The only way is to go straight to the source and demand that Farron tell you.

45
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,440
Yep, normally I would.

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,220
But the boy committed suicide, they say.

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:25,280
We'll be right back.

48
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:55,280
We'll see you next time.

49
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:06,600
Oh, come on now, Martin.

50
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,500
Think of it as a favor for an old friend.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,300
At least let me take a look at the suicide note, huh?

52
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,400
The handwriting's been analyzed.

53
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,840
Without a doubt, the kid wrote it himself, okay?

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,060
Look, you're an outsider now, Richard.

55
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,000
I can't justify bending the rules.

56
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,920
The two kids who found the body, Carl Neumann and Lota Frank,

57
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,360
Didn't they work at the same part-time job as Edmund Farran?

58
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,140
They were just friends, that's all.

59
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,380
Well, maybe they weren't such good friends.

60
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,720
So, how are you doing anyway? Is it the same old grind?

61
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,740
Yeah, you know how it is. We never have enough personnel.

62
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,260
In fact, I've had no time to rest since I took over your position, so thanks a bunch, Richard.

63
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,620
Slowpoke Martin has become one of the big shots now.

64
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,500
You don't get to call me that anymore.

65
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,060
Hmm?

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,260
Well, you're not my boss anymore,

67
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,160
so I don't have to put up with your wisecracks.

68
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,640
Oh, come on, Martin.

69
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,060
You just don't get it, do you?

70
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,620
You have no idea how much trouble you put us through.

71
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,220
We spent countless hours hunting down that serial killer

72
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,360
and had him in our sights,

73
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
but you were drunk as hell and killed him.

74
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,840
Believe me, it was no picnic cleaning up your mess.

75
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,420
Now, if you'll excuse me,

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,920
I haven't got time to waste on simple suicides.

77
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,520
I'm a very busy investigator with important criminal cases.

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
I want to check out the crime scene.

79
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,100
I presume everything's been preserved, right?

80
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,060
I already gave the go-ahead to have it cleared out,

81
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,060
since it's been determined that there was no crime.

82
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,700
They'll be removing all of the deceased's effects sometime today.

83
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,880
Damn it!

84
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,880
When did Slowpoke Martin become so efficient?

85
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,020
I made it.

86
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,580
They're supposed to be arriving any time now to take everything away.

87
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,280
Don't worry. I won't be more than a couple of minutes.

88
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,200
He must have hung his rope from this pipe in the ceiling.

89
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,100
And it appears that he wrote a suicide note at this desk.

90
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,620
Here's a paper he was in the middle of writing.

91
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,540
The birth of tragedy, process and reality, world views on psychology.

92
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,300
Par for the course for a philosophy student.

93
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,020
These must be the materials he was using for his paper.

94
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,020
Caesar's Gallic Wars?

95
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,140
Now, what was he doing with this book? Seems out of place.

96
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,940
Spanish? Or it could be Latin.

97
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,120
I can't read a word of it.

98
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,160
Hmm.

99
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,000
This is the only passage underlined in the book.

100
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,040
That seems odd.

101
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,760
Oh, here it is. Room 204.

102
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,300
You two, better go down and get a bunch of boxes.

103
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,160
Okay.

104
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,280
Start with the books. It's gonna take a while.

105
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,200
I'm on it.

106
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,420
Hey, don't work too hard, guys.

107
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,580
Uh, hey, what should we do with this desk?

108
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,680
Uh, let's just leave it there.

109
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,340
All right.

110
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
Yeah?

111
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,020
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your former neighbor.

112
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,660
I have nothing more to say. Just leave me alone.

113
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,060
Hold on. I'm not with the local police. I'm a private investigator.

114
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,740
I don't care who you are, mister. You're bothering me.

115
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,440
And I have a paper due tomorrow, but I haven't been able to get it finished

116
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,340
because of all the questioning and commotion going on next door.

117
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,460
All right, I'll be quick. Just one question, then.

118
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,220
Would you happen to know if these two were close friends of Edmund Farran?

119
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,140
Couldn't say. I'm too busy to hang out watching everybody around here.

120
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,180
But as far as I know, that guy didn't seem to have any friends I ever saw.

121
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,920
Really?

122
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,540
I've said enough. Go away.

123
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,440
Hold on a second. Just one more little thing.

124
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,160
Aw, come on. Now what?

125
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,460
Could you translate this passage for me?

126
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,520
The part that's underlined in red ink.

127
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,160
Huh?

128
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,580
This is just ridiculous.

129
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,160
It's gonna be your fault if I flunk my class.

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
I can't believe I'm doing this for you.

131
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,420
I appreciate it.

132
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,120
Hmm. It says I can no longer continue...

133
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,560
Mm-hmm.

134
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,440
...to deceive.

135
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,500
Mm-hmm.

136
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:20,960
Hmm?

137
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,540
What was the last thing you said?

138
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,040
I don't know. Now, if you don't mind, I'm busy, okay?

139
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,760
So I can no longer continue to deceive, huh?

140
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,920
Where have I heard that before?

141
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:53,640
So, you like coming here too?

142
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,000
Hey, we met a few days ago.

143
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,940
Johan, right?

144
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,660
Why don't you come all the way up?

145
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,240
You can get a much better view if you're standing up here at the very top.

146
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,100
Right.

147
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:22,220
Hey, thanks for the hand.

148
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,580
Oh, man, kind of scary up here, huh?

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,640
It's not scary at all.

150
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,980
Johan, come down from there.

151
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:53,100
come on stop it I'm serious you're gonna fall do you come up here a lot uh yeah around this

152
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,820
time the lights start coming on in the neighborhood looks beautiful family members are returning home

153
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:06,660
and the delicious smells of dinner begin filling the air it's something I've wanted for a long time

154
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,540
time really yeah I guess because I never really had anything like that when I was

155
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:22,740
growing up so tell me what's your family like oh got it not something you want to

156
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,300
talk about wish I could say the same being bounced from one foster home to

157
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,300
another made it important if you don't mind I'd like to hear your story tell me

158
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:43,900
everything you remember this is just sloppy police work I can no longer

159
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,700
continue to deceive and those words are supposed to be proof he was writing a

160
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,060
suicide note hmm that wasn't a suicide note foreign was just working on

161
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,220
translating a Latin phrase from this book

162
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:08,300
so anyway that's my story i wish it weren't so depressing but it's all true

163
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,280
it's very strange but i feel like i can talk to you about almost anything in the world

164
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:21,740
tell me one more thing that rich father of yours are you talking about shoe vault

165
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:44,280
Those tears in your eyes...

166
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,400
Are you crying for me?

167
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,460
Listen, we've got to do something, Carl.

168
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,660
I'm there every day, tending to housekeeping chores,

169
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,380
and I see changes in him that really have me worried.

170
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,060
Ever since Edmund committed suicide, Mr. Schuwald hasn't been eating very much.

171
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,260
If he continues to starve himself, he's going to end up dying too.

172
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,760
Carl, why don't you try telling him that you're his real son?

173
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,140
What have you got to lose?

174
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,420
I want him to get to know me first, and then maybe Schuwald will grow to like me.

175
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,300
If I tell him the truth now, he won't believe it,

176
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,900
Because he just doesn't trust me yet.

177
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,460
He could completely reject me

178
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,540
and think that the only reason I'm coming forward

179
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,680
is because I'm after his money.

180
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,940
Seems like money means everything to him.

181
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,760
That's all he knows.

182
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,020
So how can he understand how I feel?

183
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,620
Well, we can't just do nothing.

184
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,800
Your father is in a deep depression

185
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,000
and we have to come up with a way to get him out of it.

186
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,000
I see you're worried about him, but don't know what to do.

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:07,540
I have an idea that I think might work I can no longer continue to deceive

188
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,300
Edmund wrote these words but they weren't meant to be a suicide note in his

189
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,940
dorm room I found this Latin book Caesar's Gallic Wars and he was working

190
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,020
on translating this underlined portion from it which means his death might not

191
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,540
been a suicide i don't have conclusive proof it's just my gut feeling based on many years

192
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:42,340
of police detective work have you been listening to a word i said anything at all no not really

193
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:53,400
why it doesn't matter now don't say that it does matter you have to believe me if i'm right that

194
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:01,360
edmund didn't commit suicide there's a possibility that your life's in danger that dear lad he was

195
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,080
my son and i can't bring him back nothing matters now wait a minute you know that's not the truth

196
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,080
i've already told you the facts everything about him including his birth was completely unrelated

197
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,960
to you he was a fake a con i'll grant you he wasn't a very good con and apparently he didn't

198
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,720
make it a habit to fool people but that's precisely what he did to you mr shoe vault he deceived you

199
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,400
i must ask you to leave now mr shoe vault is tired and needs to rest

200
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:38,520
i'm not going to let this investigation end yet and my decision has nothing to do with this being

201
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,040
my first high-profile PI job.

202
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,860
I can feel it.

203
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,900
There is a far greater evil lurking

204
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,500
somewhere behind this case.

205
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,960
Sometimes in life, even if we want to,

206
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,760
there are things we can't do over

207
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,480
and we can't ever make right.

208
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,580
They're gone.

209
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,100
Can't you understand that?

210
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,440
Yes, I understand. Only too well.

211
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,040
This isn't over yet.

212
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,320
Good day to you, sir.

213
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,880
A children's rights treaty?

214
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,820
Yes. I guess you could think of it as an international rights agreement

215
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,760
to secure and protect the civil liberties of children in countries all around the world.

216
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,040
That's what I'm currently working on in my law class

217
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,840
anyway, but my volunteer job with the orphanage is completely unrelated to that project. I do this

218
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,280
because I know I can help make a difference in their lives. Hey guys, can we get back to what

219
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,760
we were discussing earlier? You said Shuvald went bankrupt three times in the past? Yes, after each

220
00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:00,800
one of them, he would just disappear. And when he'd reappear, he'd start from scratch and work to

221
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,260
regain his fortune.

222
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,900
Mr. Shuval told me during one of our Friday reading sessions

223
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,700
how this experience re-energized him, gave him new strength.

224
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,440
Well, did you ask him where he went

225
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,240
when he disappeared each time?

226
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,320
Yes.

227
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,400
I think I get it.

228
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,680
Your plan is to take him there, am I right?

229
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,800
Everybody has a place to go where they can feel good.

230
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,860
For you, Carl, it's the rooftop of the university building,

231
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,420
where you go to watch all the city lights.

232
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,620
Mr. Koons, I think there's something wrong with the bathroom sink.

233
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,660
It could be clogged.

234
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,460
Do you mind taking a look, please?

235
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,720
There might be water dripping out of those pipes.

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,320
See?

237
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,060
Hmm.

238
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,540
Hmm.

239
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,320
Lota, there's nothing wrong with the sink.

240
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,160
It's working.

241
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,560
Open up

242
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,340
Come on, open this door now

243
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,100
Stop playing around, child

244
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:16,000
Stop playing around

245
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,040
This is unacceptable

246
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,880
Let me out

247
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,300
Open up this door now

248
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,380
Where are you going with Mr. Shuvold?

249
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,300
Open up, you kidnappers

250
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,140
I demand you open this door

251
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:32,520
Hey, guys, that's that. Mission accomplished.

252
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,720
All right, let's go.

253
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,180
Aren't you going to tell me where we're going?

254
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,300
It's a surprise.

255
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,660
Look, lady, I'm well aware that you're not the real Margot Langer.

256
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,980
I just want information on Edmund Farran,

261
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:25,500

it should be right around here care to tell me the name of this surprise

266
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:55,140
Well, as a matter of fact, we brought you out to visit Owen Burke Woods, sir.

267
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,140
We were hoping this place would cheer you up. I'm sorry.

268
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,140
Just let me out of the car.

269
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
Can you see the lake from here?

270
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:26,980
the leaves here always get so beautiful in the fall yeah very much so

271
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,520
wait something is missing what happened to the wrens why don't I hear the

272
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:56,020
chirping of the wrens yeah I know I'm so sorry this place has changed they've

273
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:02,020
turned it into a construction so you can't hear them Carl if you listen very

274
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:09,280
carefully you can make them out little birds delightfully chirping in the trees

275
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:16,560
Many apples have ripened and fallen to the ground.

276
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,340
Here.

277
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,360
And when you turn in this direction,

278
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,140
You will see a spectacular sight.

279
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,760
Autumn leaves a blazing color in the afternoon sun,

280
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,980
reflected on the calm surface of the water like in a huge mirror.

281
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,700
You must see it, don't you, sir?

282
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,820
It's hard to believe such wonders exist.

283
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:17,040
I see it. I can see it.

284
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:37,920
Back up a second.

285
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,420
I just remembered something.

286
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,280
Hmm.

287
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,040
You told me that you had two pairs of visitors.

288
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,200
And you mentioned that the black-haired boy

289
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,580
brought a girl with him so then that means the blonde brought someone oh yeah

290
00:21:51,580 --> 00:22:00,060
that's right he did have somebody with him that kid kept mumbling his words I

291
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,960
could barely understand what he was talking about the gorgeous boy who came

292
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,380
along with him ended up doing the talking he was the one giving me the

293
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:14,700
lowdown and hey truth be told if his good-looking pal would have turned

294
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,020
around and claimed he was shuvald's son i wouldn't have had any trouble believing him

295
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,420
who's the other guy tell me
