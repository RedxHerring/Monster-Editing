1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,600
And you haven't touched a drink since, is that correct?

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,560
Absolutely. Not even a drop.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,440
Well, that's very good. But you have to continue to stay away from booze to give yourself the chance to start over.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,700
There's no way I'm going to drink as long as I report to you once a week. I don't want to incur your wrath.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, just the thought of it makes me afraid.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,760
What are you talking about? I always conduct myself in a very calm, professional manner.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,200
I was kidding. I don't have time to drink anyway.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,060
case since becoming a private investigator.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,260
Well, that's very good news.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,320
Dr. Ryfine, how would you judge this fellow?

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,540
What do you mean?

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,880
Using your knowledge of physiognomy,

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,320
I thought maybe you could tell me what kind of young man

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,480
appears in this photograph.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,720
I don't practice physiognomy.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,800
Richard, I'm afraid you're mistaking me

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,480
for some kind of quack fortune teller or weirdo psychic.

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,840
But you have a well-acknowledged reputation.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,740
You're able to predict someone's behavioral traits

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,300
from just a single glance, right?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,900
of accumulating information from observing patients.

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,940
Then can you use all of those years of acquired wisdom

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,960
to tell me if this guy looks like a con man?

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,240
Con man?

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,840
That's not possible.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,300
A man with a face like his couldn't fool anyone.

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,820
Even if he tried some kind of con, he'd be easily found out.

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,800
Uh-huh.

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,580
What are the odds that he'd commit suicide?

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,700
Absolutely none at all.

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,860
People with faces like his would never kill themselves.

32
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,960
Well, I must say, Doctor, your observations seem to be pretty convincing

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,820
and give me quite a lot to think about.

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,900
And they're based on experience.

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,860
So, who hired you, if you don't mind my asking?

36
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,780
Hans-Georg Schuwald.

37
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,960
You're working for Schuwald?

38
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,620
I take it you know who he is, am I right?

39
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,980
Yes, I'm quite familiar with him.

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,620
He's the wealthy vampire of Bavaria.

41
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,760
Well, that immensely rich gentleman is my client,

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,380
and the young man in the photograph is Edmund Fahren,

43
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,940
who actually passed himself off as Shuvalt's son for a while.

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,040
Hmm. He eventually gave himself away?

45
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,780
Not really. Mr. Shuvalt bought every detail of his deception.

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,500
It wasn't your typical run-of-the-mill scam artist, you know.

47
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,200
I myself had a lot of trouble figuring out it was a complete fraud.

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,240
Even now, some pieces of the mystery about him still remain.

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,380
How did Farrin know so much about Shuvalt's missing son?

50
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,300
Where'd he get the information, and who supplied it?

51
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,740
The only way is to go straight to the source

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,380
and demand that Farran tell you.

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,440
- Yep, normally I would,

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,240
but the boy committed suicide, they say.

55
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,740
(choral singing)

56
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,200
(dramatic music)

57
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,180
(dramatic music)

58
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,300
Oh, come on now, Martin. Think of it as a favor for an old friend. At least let me take a look at the suicide note, huh?

59
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,740
The handwriting's been analyzed. Without a doubt, the kid wrote it himself, okay?

60
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,040
Look, you're an outsider now, Richard. I can't justify bending the rules.

61
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:28,380
The two kids who found the body, Carl Neumann and Loda Frank, didn't they work at the same part-time job as Edmund Farran?

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,120
They were just friends, that's all.

63
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,380
Well, maybe they weren't such good friends.

64
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,720
So, how are you doing anyway? Is it the same old grind?

65
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,760
Yeah, you know how it is. We never have enough personnel.

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,620
In fact, I've had no time to rest since I took over your position.

67
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,260
So, thanks a bunch, Richard.

68
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,620
Slowpoke Martin has become one of the big shots now.

69
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,480
You don't get to call me that anymore.

70
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,140
Well, you're not my boss anymore, so I don't have to put up with your wisecracks.

71
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,640
Oh, come on, Martin.

72
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,060
You just don't get it, do you?

73
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,620
You have no idea how much trouble you put us through.

74
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,220
We spent countless hours hunting down that serial killer

75
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,360
and had him in our sights,

76
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,840
but you were drunk as hell and killed him.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,840
Believe me, it was no picnic cleaning up your mess.

78
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,420
Now, if you'll excuse me,

79
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,940
I haven't got time to waste on simple suicides.

80
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,380
I'm a very busy investigator with important criminal cases.

81
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
- I wanna check out the crime scene.

82
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,320
been preserved right? I already gave the go-ahead to have it cleared out since

83
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,880
it's been determined that there was no crime. They'll be removing all of the

84
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,880
deceased's effects sometime today. Damn it! When did slowpoke Martin become so efficient?

85
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,240
I made it. They're supposed to be arriving anytime now to take everything

86
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,320
Don't worry. I won't be more than a couple of minutes.

87
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,200
He must have hung his rope from this pipe in the ceiling.

88
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,080
And it appears that he wrote a suicide note at this desk.

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,620
Here's a paper he was in the middle of writing.

90
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,240
"The Birth of Tragedy," "Process and Reality," "World Views on Psychology."

91
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,380
for the course for a philosophy student.

92
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,040
These must be the materials he was using for his paper.

93
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,340
Hm?

94
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
Caesar's Gallic Wars?

95
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,900
Now, what was he doing with this book?

96
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,160
Seems out of place.

97
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,920
Spanish? Or it could be Latin.

98
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,120
I can't read a word of it.

99
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,140
Hm.

100
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,020
This is the only passage underlined in the book.

101
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,040
That seems odd.

102
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,280
Oh, here it is. Room 204.

103
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,340
You two, better go down and get a bunch of boxes.

104
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,160
Okay.

105
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,280
Start with the books. It's gonna take a while.

106
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,200
I'm on it.

107
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,440
Hey, don't work too hard, guys.

108
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,600
Uh, hey, what should we do with this desk?

109
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,680
Uh, let's just leave it there.

110
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,360
All right.

111
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,260
Yeah?

112
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,020
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your former neighbor.

113
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,640
I have nothing more to say. Just leave me alone.

114
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,620
I'm not with the local police. I'm a private investigator. I don't care who you are mister

115
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,920
You're bothering me, and I have a paper due tomorrow

116
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,100
But I haven't been able to get it finished because of all the questioning and commotion going on next door all right

117
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:44,320
I'll be quick just one question then would you happen to know if these two were close friends of Edmund foreign couldn't say?

118
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,140
I'm too busy to hang out watching everybody around here

119
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:53,560
But as far as I know that guy didn't seem to have any friends. I ever saw really I've said enough go away

120
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,440
There's one more little thing.

121
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,180
Aw, come on, now what?

122
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,460
Could you translate this passage for me?

123
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,520
The part that's underlined in red ink.

124
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,100
Huh?

125
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,620
This is just ridiculous.

126
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,160
It's going to be your fault if I flunk my class.

127
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,980
I can't believe I'm doing this for you.

128
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,360
I appreciate it.

129
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:19,040
It says, "I can no longer continue to deceive."

130
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,540
What was the last thing you said?

131
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,340
I don't know.

132
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,060
I'm busy, okay?

133
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,780
- So I can no longer continue to deceive, huh?

134
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,920
Where have I heard that before?

135
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,040
(footsteps thudding)

136
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,040
(door creaking)

137
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,640
- So, you like coming here too?

138
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,000
Hey, we met a few days ago.

139
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,940
Johan, right?

140
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,660
Why don't you come all the way up?

141
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,240
You can get a much better view if you're standing up here at the very top.

142
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,120
Right.

143
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,200
Hey, thanks for the hand.

144
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,600
Oh man, kind of scary up here, huh?

145
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,240
It's not scary at all.

146
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,980
Johan, come down from there!

147
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,740
Come on, stop it!

148
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,480
I'm serious! You're gonna fall!

149
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,020
Do you come up here a lot?

150
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,940
Uh, yeah.

151
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,940
Yeah. Around this time, the lights start coming on and the neighborhood looks beautiful.

152
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,400
Family members are returning home, and the delicious smells of dinner begin filling the air.

153
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,000
It's something I've wanted for a long time.

154
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,000
Really?

155
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,060
Yeah. I guess because I never really had anything like that when I was growing up.

156
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,040
So tell me, what's your family like?

157
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,220
Oh, got it. Not something you want to talk about.

158
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,400
Wish I could say the same. Being bounced from one foster home to another made it important.

159
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,200
If you don't mind, I'd like to hear your story.

160
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:31,580
Huh?

161
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,420
Tell me everything you remember.

162
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,780
This is just sloppy police work.

163
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,680
I can no longer continue to deceive and those words are supposed to be proof. He was writing a suicide note

164
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,400
Hmm that wasn't a suicide note foreign was just working on translating a latin phrase from this book

165
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,750
So anyway, that's my story I

166
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,320
Wish it weren't so depressing, but it's all true

167
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,240
It's very strange, but I feel like I can talk to you about almost anything in the world.

168
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,440
Tell me one more thing.

169
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,320
That rich father of yours...

170
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,780
Are you talking about Shuvald?

171
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,420
Those tears in your eyes, are you crying for me?

172
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,460
Listen, we've got to do something, Carl.

173
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,660
I'm there every day, tending to housekeeping chores,

174
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,320
and I see changes in him that really have me worried.

175
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,820
Ever since Edmund committed suicide,

176
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,060
Mr. Schuwald hasn't been eating very much.

177
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,500
If he continues to starve himself,

178
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,280
he's going to end up dying too.

179
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,760
Carl, why don't you try telling him that you're his real son?

180
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,140
What have you got to lose?

181
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,620
I want him to get to know me first,

182
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,420
and then maybe Shuvald will grow to like me.

183
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,300
If I tell him the truth now, he won't believe it,

184
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,900
because he just doesn't trust me yet.

185
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,480
He could completely reject me,

186
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,560
and think that the only reason I'm coming forward

187
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,700
is because I'm after his money.

188
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,940
Seems like money means everything to him.

189
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,760
That's all he knows.

190
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,020
So how can he understand how I feel?

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,620
Well, we can't just do nothing.

192
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,800
Your father is in a deep depression,

193
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,000
and we have to come up with a way to get him out of it.

194
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,020
I see you're worried about him, but don't know what to do.

195
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,120
Huh?

196
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,580
I have an idea that I think might work.

197
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,460
I can no longer continue to deceive.

198
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,600
Edmund wrote these words, but they weren't meant to be a suicide note.

199
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,320
In his dorm room, I found this Latin book.

200
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,820
"Caesar's Gallic Wars."

201
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,960
And he was working on translating this underlined portion from it, which means his death might not have been a suicide

202
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,780
I don't have conclusive proof. It's just my gut feeling based on many years of police detective work

203
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,360
Have you been listening to a word I said anything at all?

204
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,240
No

205
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,420
Not really

206
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,700
[SIGHS]

207
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,340
Why?

208
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,880
It doesn't matter now.

209
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,880
Don't say that.

210
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,680
It does matter.

211
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,200
You have to believe me.

212
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,940
If I'm right that Edmund didn't commit suicide,

213
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,520
there's a possibility that your life's in danger.

214
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,400
That dear lad, he was my son, and I can't bring him back.

215
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,340
Nothing matters.

216
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,520
Now, wait a minute.

217
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,040
You know that's not the truth.

218
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,840
I've already told you the facts.

219
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
Everything about him, including his birth,

220
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,860
He was a fake, a con.

221
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,360
I'll grant you, he wasn't a very good con,

222
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,520
and apparently, he didn't make it a habit to fool people.

223
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,480
But that's precisely what he did to you, Mr. Shuvalt.

224
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,620
He deceived you.

225
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,200
I must ask you to leave now.

226
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,340
Mr. Shuvalt is tired and needs to rest.

227
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm not going to let this investigation end yet.

228
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,520
And my decision has nothing to do with this being

229
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,640
my first high-profile PI job.

230
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,440
There is a far greater evil lurking somewhere behind this case.

231
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,880
Sometimes in life, even if we want to,

232
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,420
there are things we can't do over and we can't ever make right.

233
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,080
They're gone. Can't you understand that?

234
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,440
Yes, I understand. Only too well.

235
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,380
Good day to you, sir.

236
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,880
A children's rights treaty?

237
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,820
Yes. I guess you could think of it as an international rights agreement

238
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,780
to secure and protect the civil liberties of children in countries all around the world.

239
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,480
That's what I'm currently working on in my law class, anyway.

240
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,800
But my volunteer job with the orphanage is completely unrelated to that project.

241
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,360
I do this because I know I can help make a difference in their lives.

242
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,360
Hey guys, can we get back to what we were discussing earlier?

243
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,800
You said Shuvald went bankrupt three times in the past?

244
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,840
Yes. After each one of them, he would just disappear.

245
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,480
And when he'd reappear, he'd start from scratch,

246
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,680
and work to regain his fortune.

247
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,400
Mr. Shuvald told me during one of our Friday reading sessions

248
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,100
how this experience re-energized him, gave him new strength.

249
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,700
Well, did you ask him where he went when he disappeared each time?

250
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,520
Yes.

251
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,080
I think I get it. Your plan is to take him there, am I right?

252
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,040
Everybody has a place to go where they can feel good.

253
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,300
For you, Carl, it's the rooftop of the university building, where you go to watch all the city lights.

254
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:38,640
Mr. Koons, I think there's something wrong with the bathroom sink. It could be clogged.

255
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,360
Please? There might be water dripping out of those pipes. See?

256
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,580
Hmm...

257
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,160
Lota, there's nothing wrong with the sink. It's working.

258
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,260
Open up! Come on, open this door now!

259
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,980
Stop playing around, child.

260
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,940
( grunting )

261
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,040
Stop playing around! This is unacceptable!

262
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,280
Let me out! Open up this door now!

263
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,320
Where are you going with Mr. Schuwald?

264
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,240
Open up, you kidnappers!

265
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,140
I demand you open this door!

266
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,380
Hey, guys, that's that. Mission accomplished.

267
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,720
All right, let's go.

268
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,180
Aren't you going to tell me where we're going?

269
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,140
It's a surprise.

270
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,700
Look, lady, I'm well aware that you're not the real Margot Langer.

271
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,280
I just won information on Edmund Farran, the boy who died recently.

272
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,540
He came to see you not long ago, didn't he?

273
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,500
Farran.

274
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,340
Remind me which one he was?

275
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,400
Which one?

276
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,660
Apparently, I'm very popular.

277
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,760
I had two pairs of visitors.

278
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,560
Each said he was Shuvalt's kid.

279
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,280
Was he the blonde one?

280
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,440
- The black-haired? - Yeah, the black-haired one came with a girl.

281
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,560
Isn't that funny? I still can't believe he'd actually show up with a girl in a place like--

282
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,000
Black hair, you say? Did the girl have glasses?

283
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,560
I got photographs of them somewhere. These two?

284
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,660
- Yeah, that's who I saw. - You're positive about this?

285
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,600
He said that he was Hans-Georg Schuwald's son?

286
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,580
Are you sure this is the right spot?

287
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,880
Yeah, I'm absolutely certain. It should be right around here.

288
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,060
Care to tell me the name of this surprise?

289
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,320
Well, as a matter of fact, we brought you out to visit Owenburg Wood, sir.

290
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,080
We were hoping this place would cheer you up. I'm sorry.

291
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,480
Just let me out of the car

292
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,680
Can you see the lake from here

293
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:25,120
The leaves here always get so beautiful in the fall. Yeah very much so

294
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,940
Wait. Something is missing. What happened to the Wrens? Why don't I hear the chirping

295
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:54,720
of the Wrens? Yeah, I know. I'm so sorry. This place has

296
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,800
changed. They've turned it into a construction site.

297
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:05,240
You can't hear them, Carl? If you listen very carefully, you can make them out. Little

Here.

301
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,140
And when you turn in this direction, you will see a spectacular sight.

302
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,740
Autumn leaves ablaze in color in the afternoon sun,

303
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,960
reflected on the calm surface of the water like in a huge mirror.

304
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,700
You must see it, don't you, sir?

305
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,820
It's hard to believe such wonders exist.

- Back up a second, I just remembered something.

311
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,040
You told me that you had two pairs of visitors

312
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,220
and you mentioned that the black haired boy

313
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,380
brought a girl with him.

314
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,240
- The blonde brought someone.

- Oh yeah, that's right.

316
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,520
He did have somebody with him.

317
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,860
That kid kept mumbling his words.

318
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,240
I could barely understand what he was talking about.

and claimed he was Shuvald's son,
