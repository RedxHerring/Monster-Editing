1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,420
This is the most scandalous case that has ever occurred in the history of the Czech police force.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,160
Much to our dismay, we discovered that the three officers who were murdered were connected to the former Czechoslovakian secret police.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,140
In light of these incidents, I would like to believe that all the dark connections which have stained our reputation have been purged from the Prague station.

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,660
Remember, you are proud officers of this force. I expect conscientious behavior from all of you.

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,340
And let me say this. As your new chief, I intend to carry out a very thorough reform here.

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,740
And my first order of business is to regain our citizens' trust.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,900
I will now introduce you to the five-member Special Investigative Task Force,

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,560
which was sent over here from the government.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,080
It goes without saying that I expect you to cooperate with them

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,380
so we may close the book on this atrocious case as soon as possible.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,580
You're Detective Suk, correct?

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,760
Yes.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,680
As your new chief, I would like to say thanks

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,480
for the fine investigative work that you've done on this case to help bring it to light.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,440
You're very welcome, sir.

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,200
Oh, and by the way, Detective, what case are you currently working on?

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,260
The one Inspector Zemon was on, which involves the murder of Pedrov,

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,680
a man who was operating an illegal orphanage.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,360
Very well then. Please continue to devote all your efforts to solving it, Detective.

20
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,360
Yes, sir. I'll be on my way then.

21
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,720
Oh, uh, one more thing.

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,140
That tall man who emerged as a suspect in Inspector Xie Man's murder,

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,740
do you have any pertinent details on him that you can give me before you get back to work?

24
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,840
No, sir. I don't have any solid information on him as of yet.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,380
I see. You may go now.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,160
Thank you. Good day, sir.

27
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,360
Yan Suk. He's been assigned to this division for a year now. Zayman took him under his

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,300
wing early on, and they became close. Suk uncovered Detective Patella and Yanichek's

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,800
hidden past. He also met with Chief Hamrick right before he died. I want you to keep an

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,500
eye on that kid.

31
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,240
Yes, sir.

32
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,500
[MUSIC]

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,120
(dramatic music)

34
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,020
(bells ringing)

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,080
(bell ringing)

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,840
- Hey.

37
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,700
- You know, when I called up that hotel

38
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,900
where you told me you'd be staying,

39
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,420
I was kind of surprised to hear you answer the phone.

40
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,540
Not that I'm complaining.

41
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,780
- Well, it sounds as though you thought

42
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,120
you were going to be deceived again.

43
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,320
- Maybe.

44
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,500
- Orange juice, please.

45
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,980
Mr. Grimmer, I know you wanted to meet me someplace where there were large crowds, but

46
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,080
is this spot really okay?

47
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,720
What do you mean by okay?

48
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,400
I spoke to the new chief.

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,940
He hasn't taken you off the suspect list for Zemon's murder yet.

50
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,400
Besides, you're being pursued by former members of the Czechoslovakian secret police.

51
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,160
Come to think of it, you might be right about the crowd.

52
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,640
Maybe it makes you safer.

53
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,260
There's no such thing as a safe place.

54
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,260
Fixin' to do it, they can get me any place, any time.

55
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,960
For example, they could take me out from that window

56
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,880
with the red drapes.

57
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,100
- Look, Mr. Grimmer, I want you to level with me, okay?

58
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,300
Who are you really?

59
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,520
- Just a struggling freelance journalist.

60
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,300
- But if that's true,

61
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,920
Guess I'm just nosy. Seems to come with the territory.

62
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,640
How can you make light of it?

63
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,240
At every moment, your life is in danger.

64
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,460
Don't worry about me.

65
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,700
It was my decision to get involved. I knew it was risky.

66
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,020
Sook is currently at a cafe in Republic Square, and he's not alone.

67
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,580
He's meeting with the suspect now. A tall, rather lanky fellow.

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,220
There's no doubt in my mind that it's Grimmer.

69
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,320
Yes. Should we continue to observe them for a bit longer, sir?

70
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,000
All of this started when you went to see Petrov.

71
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,580
This was a man who conducted brainwashing experiments on orphaned children in East Germany back before the Unification, right?

72
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,280
Right.

73
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,580
And then, before he died, Petrov gave you the key to his bank's safety deposit box where he kept a record of those same experiments. Is that right?

74
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,620
Yeah. And he also mentioned something about the monster's past.

75
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,700
I wonder what he could have meant by that.

76
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,800
It seems that there are many people who,

77
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,620
for whatever reason, want to get their hands on that data.

78
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,760
You mean the former secret police?

79
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,260
And also that lovely blonde lady.

80
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,860
The children at Pedrov's orphanage also mentioned her.

81
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,740
Called her the pretty blonde lady.

82
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,700
They said they saw her leaving the house right after Pedrov was mortally wounded.

83
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,860
Do you have any idea who that woman might be?

84
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,020
I don't have a clue. She's a mystery to me.

85
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,360
Is it alright you're being here like this?

86
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:12,920
Huh?

87
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,240
I mean, you haven't told your superiors about this meeting.

88
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,460
You're here acting on your own, aren't you?

89
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,060
That's not exactly what I'd call being an honest team player.

90
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,720
Look, I'm not planning to hide any of this from them.

91
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,380
I'm exercising my own discretion.

92
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
I'll report to my superiors

93
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,460
after I've gathered all evidence in this case.

94
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,560
And if I do a thorough investigation,

95
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,840
I can prove to them without a doubt that you're innocent.

96
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,540
Is something the matter?

97
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,520
Look slowly to your nine o'clock.

98
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,500
That suspicious-looking fellow

99
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,680
sitting under the umbrella reading a newspaper.

100
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,340
What do you think?

101
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,340
Secret police, you think?

102
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,780
Couldn't say.

103
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,260
Now then, shall we go?

104
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,260
Alright, but where do we go?

105
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,060
You brought it with you, didn't you?

106
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,200
You know, the key to the safety deposit box that I gave you.

107
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:10,820
Yeah?

108
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,700
Don't you want to find out the identity of this so-called monster?

109
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,120
Yes.

110
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,020
In that case, we'd better get going.

111
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,700
Though knowing who it is might be hazardous to our health.

112
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,180
You're looking a little pale, Sook.

113
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,000
Did I just see that pretty blonde lady?

114
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,820
Hey, what's wrong?

115
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,420
(scoffs)

116
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,680
- Uh, nothing.

117
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,360
I must have imagined it.

118
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,900
- Sook is on the move.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,860
I'm on him.

120
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,540
(dramatic music)

121
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,420
I spoke with you before on the telephone.

122
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,300
I'm Detective Suk, Prague Police.

123
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,680
Just wait here a moment, please.

124
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,280
Thank you both for your patience.

125
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,140
If you follow me, I will take you to the vault.

126
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,220
This is where we have our safety deposit boxes.

127
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,820
You may use that room to view the contents.

128
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,100
Research papers, and a single cassette tape.

129
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,380
Well, I do have a tape recorder with me.

130
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,320
If you're ready to hear it, then I'm going to press play now.

131
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,500
Do you know what this place is?

132
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,280
5-1-1 Kinderheim.

133
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,180
That voice.

134
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,800
It's a boy.

135
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,980
What is your name?

136
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,180
My name is Johan.

137
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,600
[EXPLOSION]

138
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,240
My name is Johan.

139
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,040
What is your last name?

140
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's try that again.

141
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,200
What is your last name?

142
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,640
My name is Otto.

143
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,560
Oh, my name is Hans.

144
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,200
My name is Thomas.

145
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,500
My name is--

146
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,460
Which one is your real name?

147
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,540
Once upon a time, in a land far away,

148
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,860
there lived a nameless monster.

149
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,720
The monster was dying to have a name.

150
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:36,800
before? I was waiting for Anna. Who is Anna? I was reading a picture book while I was waiting

151
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,380
for Anna. This boy was drugged, Suk. They gave him something before this session was

152
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:52,100
put on tape. Who is your father? I don't know. Your mother? I think she's alive. You know,

153
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,260
You're a very bright child is there anything you're afraid of

154
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,660
What is it that you are most afraid of

155
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,060
Let me ask a different question then have you ever killed anyone

156
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Many people were dead

157
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,900
It was like

158
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,300
Ana and I were the only two people in the world

159
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,920
Where was that place?

160
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,460
Let's go back to that other question again.

161
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,100
What is it that you are the most afraid of?

162
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,680
The monster inside of me is getting bigger.

163
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,280
Munch, munch, chomp, chomp, gobble, gobble, gulp.

164
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,680
Munch, munch, chomp, chomp, gobble, gobble, gulp.

165
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,500
Munch, munch, chomp, chomp, gobble, gobble, gulp.

166
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,500
What I'm most afraid of, it's...

167
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,780
I feel sick. Like I'm gonna throw up.

168
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,920
What happened, Mr. Grimmer? Hey, are you alright?

169
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,220
Yeah.

170
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,200
What did we just hear on this tape?

171
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,700
I mean, was that little boy the voice of the monster?

172
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,260
I really don't understand what's going on.

173
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,540
Even though we don't know what this tape is about,

174
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,020
there are people out there who would do anything to have it in their possession.

175
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,340
For one, the former Czechoslovakian secret police…

176
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,880
And to them, it won't make any difference if we just listen to part of the tape,

177
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,400
or all the way to the end.

178
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm sorry to tell you, but there's no turning back.

179
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,940
What are you going to do now?

180
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,140
Do you plan to return the tape and the research papers to the safety deposit box?

181
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,620
No.

182
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,180
Under normal circumstances, they should be stored here as evidence, but all things considered...

183
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,620
You're planning to hang on to them?

184
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,140
Then I think we should leave separately.

185
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,320
Let me serve as your decoy.

186
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,220
After all, it's me they're watching.

187
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,400
Oh, yeah.

188
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,140
Better give me your telephone number and street address.

189
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,320
If we're both able to make it home safely,

190
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,320
we'll have a way of getting in touch with each other in the future.

191
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,980
(dramatic music)

192
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,120
- I made it, and I don't think I was followed.

193
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,360
I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.

194
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,140
I mean, I don't have a whole lot of confidence in him.

195
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,140
Says here he lives on Lanover Street.

196
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:44,440
What are you doing in my apartment?

197
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,440
What's going on?

198
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,760
That's the same question we wanted answered.

199
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,740
Do you know who we are, or do I need to enlighten you?

200
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,400
You're both part of that special task force.

201
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,500
The government assigned you to the Prague office.

202
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,680
My partner here is Detective 3rd Grade Novak, and I'm Detective Zanda, also 3rd Grade.

203
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,820
Care to tell me why the two of you broke into my place?

204
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,040
How long have you been meeting with Grimmer?

205
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,720
And don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about.

206
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,780
You two just met at the cafe in Republic Square

207
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,760
and went to the Prochaska Bank together.

208
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,140
You also know the man in this photograph, don't you?

209
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:18,780
Huh?

210
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,340
Captain Karl Lanka.

211
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,420
He was an important name in the Czech secret police,

212
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,400
who are now underground.

213
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,380
What? No, I've never seen that man before.

214
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,660
Our task force ran a check on your bank account.

215
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,840
made a hefty deposit. Where'd all that money come from?

216
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,520
Huh?

217
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,860
Wh-what are you talking about?

218
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,480
I don't know anything about a deposit!

219
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,880
We've heard your mother is currently being hospitalized

220
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,360
for a serious illness at the Krumov Hospital.

221
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,780
I understand that hospital care and private nurses

222
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,980
can get quite expensive.

223
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,340
Yeah, so what are you trying to imply?

224
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,280
Well, after your mother separated from your father,

225
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,040
without any support from him.

226
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,160
Which says to me, you must care a lot about her.

227
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,220
- Just what are you suggesting, detective?

228
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,780
- We would like to search each room of your flat.

229
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,460
- Yeah, do whatever you want, what do I care?

230
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,920
You're gonna see I'm not hiding money or anything else!

231
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,760
Because I've got nothing to hide.

232
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,420
Hey, Zonda, come here for a second.

233
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,420
Where'd you find these things?

234
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,300
They aren't mine!

235
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,600
They were on a shelf in a cabinet above your bathroom sink, Detective Suk.

236
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,060
No!

237
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,400
I don't know what they are!

238
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,400
They don't belong to me!

239
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,620
We can't say for sure what this drug is until we check it out in the lab at the station

240
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,340
But in the bodies of the three dirty cops who were murdered in your station

241
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,760
We found a muscle relaxant mixed in with this type of candy

242
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,940
Whiskey bonbon candy

243
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,840
You can tell us your side of the story back at headquarters

244
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,040
As you wish

245
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,700
Investigate me as thoroughly as you see fit.

246
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,260
Oh, we will.

247
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,020
Can I ask for a favor?

248
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,800
Before we head out, can I change into a clean shirt?

249
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,060
I've been wearing this one all day.

250
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,940
Fine. But hurry up.

251
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,780
Just calm down. Calm down.

252
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,060
I haven't done anything. My record's perfect.

253
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,160
I just need to go in and explain to them that I'm innocent.

254
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,400
(dramatic music)

255
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Wait, I smell gunpowder.

256
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,500
(door creaking)

257
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,580

258
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,800

262
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:55,960
- Sook!
