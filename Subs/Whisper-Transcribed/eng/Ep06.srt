1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Mr. Maurer, you haven't bathed in days, have you?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,320
And you've been wearing that same shirt for half a week.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,960
You promised you'd shower every other day.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,320
Quit nagging me, will ya?

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,960
You have a visitor in the reception area.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,840
All right, I'm going home.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,580
Listen, you're gonna have to make your own coffee, okay?

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,100
A visitor? At this time of night?

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,220
Yeah, he hasn't had a bath either.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,220
You'll like him. He smells almost as bad as you do.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,980
Give it a rest.

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,620
Yeah, well whatever whose fault is it that I haven't been able to take a bath anyway

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,820
She's completely oblivious to the fact that it's cuz of me that we all still have work

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,940
Even though this paper has no future. How hard is that to figure out?

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,160
geez

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Sorry to keep you waiting

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,940
Hmm. Hello. My name is tenma sir, and I've come here to ask you for your help

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:07,720
help. She was right. He certainly looks filthy. I see. So you're a doctor, huh? Well, you don't

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,280
look like one. Let me get this straight. I just want to make sure that we're on the same page

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,960
here. So what you're saying is that the infamous serial killer who's been executing middle-aged

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,900
couples throughout Germany has his next target in Heidelberg? This particular couple have an

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,640
adopted daughter, and you're saying that when that girl turns 20, the killer will come to take

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:35,440
her way. And when he does show up, the foster parents are going to be killed. And you have

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:46,080
no idea who that girl or her parents are, but you want to save them. If that's not delusional,

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,100
I don't know what is. I'm not joking about this. You have to believe me. What a load

26
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,740
of hooey. Not even a third-rate tabloid would buy that story. Look, I didn't come here to

27
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,740
After the twins escaped, they disappeared.

28
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,740
It was at least six months that went by before the brother was seen in Munich.

29
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,740
So what's your point, huh?

30
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,740
I believe that after leaving the hospital,

31
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,740
those children must have come here, to Heidelberg, together.

32
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,740
You know, this is just your theory.

33
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,740
And then the two of them were raised by the twin sister's current foster parents.

34
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,740
But the brother ran away from home after a short period,

35
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,740
leaving the sister behind.

36
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,740
Why don't you write a novel?

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,080
Probably won't sell though wait

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,560
Maybe the couple reported a missing child with the police or there might be a newspaper article about it from nine years ago

39
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,260
All I'm asking is to look through your archives from the past nine years. I'm begging you

40
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,900
Wait, please there mustn't be any more victims the killing has to stop listen to me

41
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:06,240
The boss is allergic to technology.

42
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,560
Reduced versions as well as the original archives from nine years ago.

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,460
And the rest of these are the articles that never did make it to print.

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,200
Thank you very much.

45
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,440
So, is that some sort of Japanese bow?

46
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,640
Well, domo arigato.

47
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,120
Let me say this. This doesn't mean that I believe you. I just don't have time to listen.

48
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,240
Show yourself out when you're done looking, you got that?

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,120
God, why do I always have to deal with the weirdos?

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,720
Please. Please, let me find it.

51
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:25,720
We'll be right back.

52
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:55,720
We'll be right back.

53
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:24,140
Good morning, Nina!

54
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,840
Good morning.

55
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,680
You're looking much better. I'm so glad.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,780
I was really scared when you fainted like that, you know?

57
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,020
I guess you really didn't like the boy we hooked you up with, huh?

58
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,140
No, that's not it at all.

59
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,140
I just felt sick all of a sudden.

60
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,100
I need to apologize to him.

61
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,480
Oh, never mind. You don't have to worry about him. Trust me.

62
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,200
Well, it turns out when I talked to Otto,

63
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,380
I found out he wasn't your Prince Charming on a white horse after all.

64
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,460
Yeah, we asked, and he said he didn't know anything at all

65
00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:02,880
about those email messages oh really so you're saying that you fainted right

66
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,460
after you saw this particular boy at your campus huh yes well what did this

67
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,920
fellow look like I only saw him for a second so I'm not really sure and do you

68
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,360
remember exactly what you felt at the moment when you saw him I remember I

69
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,720
I felt nostalgic.

70
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,320
Hmm.

71
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,880
But maybe not.

72
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,900
I don't know how to explain it.

73
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,640
Go on.

74
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,280
Just take it easy.

75
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,600
Don't force yourself.

76
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,100
Absolute evil?

77
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:50,960
Hmm?

78
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,480
I don't know how to put it, but...

79
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,860
Yes, it felt just like when I used to have that nightmare.

80
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,220
Hmm.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,160
Absolute evil, eh?

82
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,060
It sounds more like it has to do with your religious beliefs.

83
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,560
I don't think so.

84
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,800
I'm not really one to go to church regularly.

85
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,860
But I think if I see this young man again,

86
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,780
it might help to clarify things for me.

87
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,000
You're thinking this might help you recover your memory, is that it?

88
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,820
- Yes.

89
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,380
- I suppose that's one way to go about it,

90
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,200
but I don't think you should allow this

91
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,320
to disturb the peace you now have.

92
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,960
It's important you continue to focus on your future

93
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,200
and the road ahead.

94
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,500
- Okay.

95
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,820
- Don't worry.

96
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,980
Just work up a sweat doing your Aikido

97
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,840
and your anxiety should disappear.

98
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,920
- Hey Maurer, so did you pull another all-nighter?

99
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,000
- Yeah.

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,220
- By the way, I'm just wondering,

101
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,700
were you the one who told that person

102
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,360
he could use the file room?

103
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,560
- That weird guy?

104
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,680
- Yeah, I asked him what he was doing there

105
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,260
and he said you had given him permission

106
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,740
to look through the archives.

107
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,580
- Why, you mean he's still in there?

108
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,600
Hey you, time to hit the road.

109
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,460
Hey, are you all right?

110
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,300
Hey!

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:28,840
Come on, eat up.

112
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,280
Thank you.

113
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Good, isn't it? I always come here for breakfast.

114
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,240
So don't you ever eat at home, then? What about your family?

115
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,040
I haven't got one. My wife walked out on me a while ago.

116
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,700
Huh?

117
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,240
I was always too busy with the work.

118
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,420
And before I knew it, my wife left with our daughter and moved back with her parents.

119
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,880
Do you ever think about trying to patch things up with her?

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why would I do that? She's the one who walked out on me.

121
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,400
Why should I have to be the one to go after her?

122
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,900
Well, it just seemed like you regretted spending so much time at work.

123
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,520
That's complete nonsense.

124
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,700
Work is priority number one, you hear?

125
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,180
Any woman who can't understand such a simple fact is welcome to leave whenever she wants.

126
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,600
Sorry about that. I didn't mean to pry.

127
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,080
That's right. It's none of your business.

128
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,020
Oh, another thing. Please do forgive me.

129
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,860
But you smoke too much. As a doctor, I recommend you cut back.

130
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,920
I told you already, it's none of your business.

131
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,480
You're beginning to sound just like that wife of mine.

132
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,440
Well, what's so bad about that?

133
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,520
It means she cares about your health.

134
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,300
Just mind your own damn business.

135
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,360
Is that Nina's birthday present?

136
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,800
Yes. I was finally able to finish it.

137
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,840
Goodness, I remember when her sweaters used to be this tiny.

138
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,000
Honey, do we really have to tell her?

139
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,020
Does she have to know that she's not our real daughter?

140
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,140
Why not just leave it alone?

141
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,980
You're right.

142
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,260
There's no point in telling her that now.

143
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,660
Nina's our daughter. That's all there is to it.

144
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,620
Mm-hmm.

145
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,140
I'm home!

146
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,740
Welcome back.

147
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,000
Ugh! I am so hungry!

148
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,140
All I have to do is focus on my future.

149
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,160
Yeah, maybe Dr. Geidel is right after all.

150
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,720
Huh?

151
00:10:45,240 --> 00:11:01,300
See you tomorrow at 7 p.m. at Heidelberg Castle for your birthday.

152
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,540
Tomorrow? At Heidelberg Castle?

153
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,500
I'm a very busy man.

154
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,540
I've been staring at newspaper clippings with you for two days.

155
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,820
I admire your gumption, but don't you think it's about time you gave up?

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,360
Hey, Doc.

157
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,900
If, and I say if, I were to ask my wife to come home again,

158
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,060
do you really think she would give it another go?

159
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,160
Yeah, if you kick the habit one day

160
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
What is it

161
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Found it

162
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,780
Eleven year old boy coast missing there's a possibility the child has been abducted

163
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,800
But there have been no ransom demands made as of yet address 16 Necker Street

164
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,240
Someone named Fortin or filed a missing person report that day

165
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,680
Hmm. There should be some more information in here somewhere.

166
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,780
Oh, here it is.

167
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,620
Huh? Oh, man.

168
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,180
What is it? What did you find?

169
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,740
Hey, Doc, you said that killer would come to take his sister away the day she turned 20. Isn't that right?

170
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,480
If the boy in this article is her twin brother, well, see for yourself. His birth date is printed on it.

171
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,100
Those twins are turning 20 today.

172
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:51,600
um hi dad it's me i just finished up at work i'm going to be meeting up with a friend and

173
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,880
then i'll be coming home uh-huh yeah at heidelberg castle really your mom is making a birthday cake

174
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,180
so don't stay out too late.

175
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,220
Was that Nina, dear?

176
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,420
Yeah. She's meeting a friend before coming home.

177
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,500
I'm wondering who this friend is.

178
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,100
Nina's a big girl now.

179
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,140
Maybe this will help me to remember things.

180
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,220
I want to know who I really am.

181
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:32,780
so doc what are you gonna do if this girl is at the fortune nurse residence whatever's going on

182
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,340
one thing's for sure they're in danger so i'll call the police and see if they can send over a

183
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:43,860
car and you think the police are just gonna show up relax nothing's happened yet doctor

184
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,120
but if we wait till then it'll be too late look nothing's gonna happen come on this is all in

185
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,440
your head. Hey, Doc, listen up. I know what I'm talking about. I actually went to the crime scene

186
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,180
of the fourth middle-aged couple murdered in Cologne. There was something unusual about those

187
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:10,360
crimes. No motive, no vengeance, no bitterness, nothing. Yeah, it just seemed like whoever did

188
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,900
this wanted to kill for killing's sake. I've been a reporter for a long time. Something tells me

189
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:22,700
you're way off base this time around doc honestly do you really think a 20 year old kid could be

190
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,580
such a cold-blooded killer there's no way a kid would do something like that it's something a

191
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:36,000
whole lot worse how could it be any worse hell that's just it i have a hard time finding the

192
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,480
words to describe that case whenever i tried to describe it the whole thing just sounds so corny

193
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,420
But the truth is, that was the devil's work.

194
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,760
One thing's for certain, Doc.

195
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,400
If I had half a chance, I'd snuff that guy in a heartbeat.

196
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,180
16 Necker Street. This is it.

197
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,040

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,160
She's gone to Heidelberg Castle. She said she was going to meet a friend there.

228
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,280
Please, let me borrow your car.

229
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,240
No, wait. We gotta call the police station first.

We don't have time to waste explaining things to the police. Give me the keys, quickly.

Hey, Doc, listen.

Be careful. Like I told you before, this guy's the devil.

Don't die on me, you got that?

236
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,280

240
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,940
So get back here quick.

241
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,560
Your wife will be glad to hear that.

242
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,100
Oh boy, how am I supposed to explain this to the police?

243
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,840
Our daughter! What's going on? Is our daughter all right?

244
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,400
What is it? What's happened?

245
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,520
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

246
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,980
But I need to use your phone.

247
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,140
What has happened to our daughter?

248
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,400
Please, tell us. Just tell us already.

249
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,940
Calm down, lady.

250
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,620
What in the hell's this?

251
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,520
It's dead. The phone line's been cut.

252
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,780
Please, Anna.

253
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,600
Just hang in there. Hold on.

254
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,640
It's getting pretty late. He's probably not coming.

255
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,780
Well, I guess that message must have been a prank after all.

256
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,680
I'm going home.

257
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,680
You can't do that.

258
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,960
You can't go.

259
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200

260
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760

00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800

262
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,280
I'm supposed to make sure you wait right here. I

263
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,720
Just told you to wait don't you understand what I'm saying?

264
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,600
