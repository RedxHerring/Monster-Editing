1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,400
Mr. Maurer, you haven't bathed in days, have you?

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,340
And you've been wearing that same shirt for half a week.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,980
You promised you'd shower every other day.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,300
Quit nagging me, will ya?

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,960
You have a visitor in the reception area.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,840
Alright, I'm going home.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,580
Listen, you're gonna have to make your own coffee, okay?

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,100
A visitor? At this time of night?

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,200
Yeah, he hasn't had a bath either.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,220
You'll like him, he smells almost as bad as you do.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,960
Give it a rest.

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,540
Yeah, well, whatever.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,640
Whose fault is it that I haven't been able to take a bath anyway?

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,980
She's completely oblivious to the fact that it's 'cause of me that we all still have work,

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,220
even though this paper has no future.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,280
How hard is that to figure out?

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,200
Jeez.

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,660
Sorry to keep you waiting.

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,620
Hello, my name is Tenma, sir.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,240
And I've come here to ask you for your help.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,860
He certainly looks filthy.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,340
I see. So you're a doctor, huh?

23
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,480
Well, you don't look like one.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,720
Let me get this straight.

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,540
I just want to make sure that we're on the same page here.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,600
So what you're saying is that the infamous serial killer

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,120
who's been executing middle-aged couples throughout Germany

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,880
has his next target in Heidelberg?

29
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,800
This particular couple have an adopted daughter,

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,300
and you're saying that when that girl turns 20,

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,160
the killer will come to take her away.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
are going to be killed, and you have no idea who that girl or her parents are, but you

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,080
want to save them.

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,200
If that's not delusional, I don't know what is.

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,980
I'm not joking about this.

36
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,140
You have to believe me.

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,680
What a load of hooey.

38
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,220
Not even a third-rate tabloid would buy that story.

39
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,700
Look, I didn't come here to sell you a story.

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,980
After the twins escaped, they disappeared.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,880
was at least six months that went by

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,820
before the brother was seen in Munich.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,180
- So what's your point, huh?

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,360
- I believe that after leaving the hospital,

45
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,100
those children must have come here, to Heidelberg, together.

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,080
- You know, this is just your theory.

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,180
- And then the two of them were raised

48
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,440
by the twin sister's current foster parents.

49
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,460
But the brother ran away from home after a short period,

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,140
leaving the sister behind.

51
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,960
- Why don't you write a novel?

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,840
Probably won't sell, though.

53
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,480
- Wait, maybe the couple reported

54
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,800
Or there might be a newspaper article about it from nine years ago.

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,120
All I'm asking is to look through your archives from the past nine years!

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm begging you!

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,740
Wait, please!

58
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,960
There mustn't be any more victims! The killing has to stop!

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,980
Listen to me!

60
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,260
The boss is allergic to technology.

61
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,560
Reduced versions as well as the original archives from nine years ago.

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,480
And the rest of these are the articles that never did make it to print.

63
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,220
Thank you very much.

64
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,420
So, is that some sort of Japanese bow?

65
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,500
Well, domo arigato.

66
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,200
Let me say this.

67
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,260
This doesn't mean that I believe you.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,240
and show yourself out when you're done looking, you got that?

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,100
God, why do I always have to deal with the weirdos?

70
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,720
- Please, please, let me find it.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,700
(choral music)

72
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,380
[MUSIC]

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,520
(dramatic music)

74
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,120
- Good morning, Nina.

75
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,840
- Good morning.

76
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,760
- You're looking much better.

77
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,660
I'm so glad.

78
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,800
really scared when you fainted like that, you know?

79
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,800
- I guess you really didn't like the boy

80
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,020
we hooked you up with, huh?

81
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,160
- No, that's not it at all.

82
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,160
I just felt sick all of a sudden.

83
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,100
I need to apologize to him.

84
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,360
- Oh, never mind.

85
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,820
You don't have to worry about him.

86
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,480
Trust me.

87
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:44,920
- Huh?

88
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,220
- Well, it turns out when I talked to Otto,

89
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,060
I found out he wasn't your Prince Charming

90
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,360
on a white horse after all.

91
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,960
- Yeah, we asked and he said he didn't know anything

92
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,620
at all about those email messages.

93
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,860
- Oh, really?

94
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,720
So you're saying that you fainted right after you saw this particular boy at your campus, huh?

95
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:06,940
Yes.

96
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,420
Well, what did this fellow look like?

97
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,140
I only saw him for a second, so I'm not really sure.

98
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,720
And do you remember exactly what you felt at the moment when you saw him?

99
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,720
I remember I felt nostalgic.

100
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,320
Hmm.

101
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,860
But maybe not. I don't know how to explain it.

102
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,640
Go on.

103
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:29,680
(Gasp)

104
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,120
(Gasp)

105
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:34,640
(Gasp)

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:34,980
(Gunshot)

107
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,440
(Gasp)

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,480
(Gunshot)

109
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,580
Just take it easy. Don't force yourself.

110
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,140
Absolute evil.

111
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:50,960
Hmm?

112
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,540
I don't know how to put it, but...

113
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,840
Yes, it felt just like when I used to have that nightmare.

114
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,160
Absolute evil, eh?

115
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,080
It sounds more like it has to do with your religious beliefs.

116
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,760
I don't think so. I'm not really one to go to church regularly.

117
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,780
But I think if I see this young man again, it might help to clarify things for me.

118
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,000
You're thinking this might help you recover your memory, is that it?

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,640
Yes.

120
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,080
I suppose that's one way to go about it.

121
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,880
But I don't think you should allow this to disturb the peace you now have.

122
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,920
It's important you continue to focus on your future and the road ahead.

123
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,460
Okay.

124
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,220
Don't worry.

125
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
Just work up a sweat doing your Aikido

126
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,500
and your anxiety should disappear.

127
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,780
Hey, Maurer.

128
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,300
So, did you pull another all-nighter?

129
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,340
Yeah.

130
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,660
By the way,

131
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,820
I'm just wondering,

132
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,620
were you the one who told that person

133
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,780
he could use the file room?

134
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,160
That weird guy?

135
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,780
Yeah.

136
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,600
I asked him what he was doing there

137
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,120
and he said you had given him permission

138
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,220
to look through the archives.

139
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,280
Why? You mean he's still in there?

140
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,340
Hey, you! Time to hit the road!

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,160
Hey! Are you alright?

142
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,800
Hey!

143
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,820
Come on, eat up.

144
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,400
Thank you.

145
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,120
Good, isn't it?

146
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,920
I always come here for breakfast.

147
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,720
So don't you ever eat at home, then?

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
What about your family?

149
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,460
Haven't got one.

150
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,000
My wife walked out on me a while ago.

151
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,700
Huh?

152
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,240
I was always too busy with the work.

153
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,360
And before I knew it, my wife left with our daughter and moved back with her parents.

154
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,400
Do you ever think about trying to patch things up with her?

155
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,300
Why would I do that?

156
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,000
She's the one who walked out on me.

157
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,420
Why should I have to be the one to go after her?

158
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,900
Well, it just seemed like you regretted spending so much time at work.

159
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,500
That's complete nonsense.

160
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,700
Work is priority number one, you hear?

161
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,180
Any woman who can't understand such a simple fact is welcome to leave whenever she wants.

162
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,280
Sorry about that.

163
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,600
I didn't mean to pry.

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,700
That's right.

165
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,240
None of your business.

166
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,040
- Oh, another thing, please do forgive me,

167
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,860
but you smoke too much.

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,860
As a doctor, I recommend you cut back.

169
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,920
- I told you already, it's none of your business.

170
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,480
You're beginning to sound just like that wife of mine.

171
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,440
- Well, what's so bad about that?

172
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,520
It means she cares about your health.

173
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,100
- Just mind your own damn business.

174
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,360
- Is that Nina's birthday present?

175
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,860
She's finally able to finish it.

176
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,840
Goodness, I remember when her sweaters used to be this tiny.

177
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,980
Honey, do we really have to tell her?

178
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,020
Does she have to know that she's not our real daughter?

179
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,080
Why not just leave it alone?

180
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,240
You're right. There's no point in telling her that now.

181
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,660
Nina's our daughter. That's all there is to it.

182
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,620
Mm-hmm.

183
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,140
I'm home!

184
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,720
Welcome back.

185
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,060
I am so hungry.

186
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,140
All I have to do is focus on my future.

187
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,240
Yeah, maybe Dr. Geidel is right after all.

188
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,320
See you tomorrow at 7 p.m. at Heidelberg Castle for your birthday.

189
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,540
Tomorrow? At Heidelberg Castle?

190
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,540
I'm a very busy man. I've been staring at newspaper clippings with you for two days.

191
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,800
I admire your gumption, but don't you think it's about time you gave up?

192
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:39,060
If, and I say if, I were to ask my wife to come home again, do you really think she would

193
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,060
give it another go?

194
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,260
Yeah, if you kick the habit one day.

195
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,000
What is it?

196
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,200
Found it.

197
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,840
11-year-old boy goes missing.

198
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,520
There's a possibility the child has been abducted, but there have been no ransom demands made as of yet.

199
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,820
Address 16 Necker Street.

200
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,320
Someone named Fortner filed a missing person report that day.

201
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,640
There should be some more information in here somewhere.

202
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,760
- Here it is.

203
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,620
Oh, man.

204
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,320
- What is it?

205
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,180
What did you find?

206
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,600
- Hey, Doc, you said that killer would come

207
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,880
to take his sister away the day she turned 20.

208
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,720
Isn't that right?

209
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,780
If the boy in this article is her twin brother,

210
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,640
well, see for yourself.

211
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,480
His birth date is printed on it.

212
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,100
Those twins are turning 20 today.

213
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,220
Um, hi, Dad. It's me. I just finished up at work.

214
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,700
I'm going to be meeting up with a friend, and then I'll be coming home.

215
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,560
Uh-huh. Yeah, at Heidelberg Castle.

216
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,140
Really? Your mom is making a birthday cake, so don't stay out too late.

217
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,220
Was that Nina, dear?

218
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,480
Yeah. She's meeting a friend before coming home. I'm wondering who this friend is.

219
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,060
Nina's a big girl now.

220
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,160
Maybe this will help me to remember things.

221
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,260
I want to know who I really am.

222
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,380
So Doc, what are you going to do if this girl is at the Fortuner's residence?

223
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,580
Whatever's going on, one thing's for sure, they're in danger.

224
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,620
So I'll call the police and see if they can send over a car.

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,740
And you think the police are just going to show up?

226
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:49,680
Yeah, doctor, but if we wait till then it'll be too late. Look nothing's gonna happen. Come on. This is all in your head

227
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:58,540
Hey doc, listen up, I know what I'm talking about. I actually went to the crime scene of the fourth middle-aged couple murdered in Cone

228
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,640
There was something unusual about those crimes

229
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,600
No motive. No vengeance. Oh bitterness nothing

230
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,420
Yeah, it just seemed like whoever did this wanted to kill for killing's sake

231
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,660
I've been a reporter for a long time.

232
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,140
Something tells me you're way off base this time around, Doc.

233
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,000
Honestly, do you really think a 20-year-old kid could be such a cold-blooded killer?

234
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,040
There's no way a kid would do something like that.

235
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,600
It's something a whole lot worse.

236
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,020
How could it be any worse?

237
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,080
Hell, that's just it.

238
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,620
I have a hard time finding the words to describe that case.

239
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,600
Whenever I tried to describe it, the whole thing just sounds so corny, but the truth

240
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,420
is, that was the devil's work.

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,380
One thing's for certain, Doc, if I had half a chance, I'd snuff that guy in a heartbeat.

242
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,960
16 Necker Street.

243
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,100
Good evening, sorry to bother you so late.

244
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,100
Yes?

245
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,360
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.

246
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,660
My name is Maurer.

247
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,240
I'm from the Heidelberg Post.

248
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,400
So you're a newspaper reporter?

249
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,740
Yeah, I'd like to ask you a few questions.

250
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,180
What about?

251
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,720
Well...

252
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,620
The missing persons report that you filed for your son in 1986...

253
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,860
I've got nothing to tell you!

254
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,620
I'm sorry, sir, but you need to talk to us. Please listen!

255
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,000
We know that you have a girl living with you.

256
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,500
The twin sister of the boy who disappeared nine years ago!

257
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,760
This is important. Please answer me!

258
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:07,980
(knocking)

259
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,100
- Son of a gun.

260
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,740
I saw a cake.

261
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,680
I just saw the mother in there.

262
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,460
She was holding a birthday cake.

263
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,640
- Nine years ago, you took in a set of twins

264
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,840
and the sister is still living with you both.

265
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,580
Well, isn't she?

266
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,000
- Please leave.

267
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,860
Nina is our daughter.

268
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,040
We are a family.

269
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,980
It's that simple.

270
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,560
Please don't cause us any unnecessary trouble.

271
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,040
Just leave us alone, please.

272
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,720
You took in a pair of twins nine years ago.

273
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,220
The little boy had surgical scars on his head.

274
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,720
The girl had amnesia, and the boy disappeared.

275
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,040
Isn't that right?

276
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,500
Mr. Fortner, listen to me.

277
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,180
You've got to call the police now.

278
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,520
All your lives are in danger, your daughters and your own.

279
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,280
Mr. Maurer.

280
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,500
What? What are you talking about? What do you mean?

281
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,160
- Look, it's very important we talk to your daughter.

282
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,840
- Well, she isn't home at the moment.

283
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,500
She's out.

284
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,460
- Huh?

285
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:09,860
- Where?

286
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,020
Where did she go?

287
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,920
- She's gone to Heidelberg Castle.

288
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,140
She said she was going to meet a friend there.

289
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,240
- Please, let me borrow your car.

290
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,020
- No, wait.

291
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,220
We gotta call the police station first.

292
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,440
- We don't have time to waste

293
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,940
explaining things to the police.

294
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,340
Give me the keys quickly.

295
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,480
- All right.

296
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,520
You go on and I'll call them myself.

297
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,740
- Thank you.

298
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,260
Hey, Doc, listen.

299
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,320
Be careful.

300
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,180
Like I told you before, this guy's the devil.

301
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,560
Don't die on me.

302
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,200
You got that?

303
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,260
Mr. Mauler, I...

304
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,020
You better come back alive.

305
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,720
Do you hear me?

306
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,900
I promise.

307
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,940
I'll follow your advice and I'll finally quit smoking, so get back here quick.

308
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,560
Your wife will be glad to hear that.

309
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,260
Huh.

310
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,980
Oh, boy.

311
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,120
How am I supposed to explain this to the police?

312
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,720
Our daughter!

313
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,080
is our daughter all right what is it what's happened don't worry she'll be

314
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,860

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,540

316
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,540

317
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Please, Anna.

318
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,200
Just hang in there.

319
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,640
Hold on.

320
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,020
It's getting pretty late.

321
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,660
He's probably not coming.

322
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,800
Well, I guess that message must have been a prank after all.

323
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,680
I'm going home.

324
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,700
You can't do that.

325
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,960
You can't go.

326
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,420
You have to wait here.

327
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,640
Who are you?

328
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,140
He told me.

329
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,080
I'm supposed to make sure you wait right here.

330
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,860
I just told you to wait. Don't you understand what I'm saying?

331
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,420
Wait!

332
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,340
I'm supposed to keep you right here, lady!

333
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,760
It's my job to keep you here!

334
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,640
Anna!

335
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,400
I guess that they're calling you Nina now.

336
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,520
Do you remember me? I'm Dr. Tenma.

337
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,380
Thank God you're okay.

338
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,580
Anna... Dr. Tenma...

339
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,340
Let's go. Back to your house.

340
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,480
Are you... my Prince Charming?

341
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,820
Who the hell are you?

342
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,960
Don't interfere. You can't interfere in this.

343
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,900
She needs to stay here. That's all there is to it.

344
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,880
If she doesn't, I won't.

345
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,580
I won't.

346
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,520
I won't get paid, you bastard!

347
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,960
He said no one else was supposed to show up!

348
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,940
Hey, are you alright?

349
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Yeah, but how on earth did you...

350
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,540
I need something to tie him up with, quick!

351
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,960
Oh, uh...

352
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,920
Tell me, who put you up to this?

353
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,840
I don't know, okay?

354
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,120
Well, when is he coming back here? What did he say?

355
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,880
Look, I don't know. All he said was he would be back as soon as it was done

356
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,140
was something very important he had to take care of.

357
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,100
Oh, God. He's at your house.

358
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,520
Come on, we have to get back to your house right away.

359
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,780
Why? What's going on?

360
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,820
I'll explain it all later. We have got to hurry, Anna.

361
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,220
Anna...

362
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,880
Let's go!

363
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,280
You have to untie me!

364
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,400
(sobbing)

365
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,900
- Please tell me, who on earth are you, Dr. Tenma?

366
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,120
You got it wrong, my name's not Anna.

367
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,300
I'm Nina.

368
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,440
- Now, but that wasn't your name

369
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,100
back when you were brought into my hospital.

370
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,880
You were Anna, and your brother,

371
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,500
your brother's name was Johan.

372
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,080
- My brother.

373
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,480
