1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,740
"Hang in there, kid."

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,300
"Shoot me, Yana."

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,140
"I'll save you, no matter what."

4
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,620
Are you going to shoot me, like you did back then?

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,400
That's right.

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,640
I've got to finally put an end to this.

7
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,920
The end.

8
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,200
What exactly is the end?

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,680
The end.

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,760
The end.

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,720
The end.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,840
The end.

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,740
The end.

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:10,540
"The end. The end. I've seen the end. Over and over. What is the end?"

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:20,820
"This is. You're going to die, and so am I. You've seen it. What exactly did you see?

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,740
Tell me! What did you see?"

17
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,940
You don't know, do you?

18
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,060
I'll tell you about it.

19
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,320
It's something that's truly horrifying.

20
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,860
I'm back.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,940
(upbeat music)

22
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,000
(dramatic music)

23
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,840
(dramatic music)

24
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,440
(ominous music)

25
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:53,520
"Something that's truly horrifying," you say, "but it's mine to tell, a story of all the

26
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,440
things I've seen."

27
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:04,060
All of those details, the ones I told you about.

28
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:20,300
When I was taken from our place at the Three Frogs, I was brought to a room that had no

29
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,700
light.

30
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,600
It was pitch black.

31
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,120
I'd reach out to touch them, but the room gave me no sense of up or down, left or right.

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,580
But I knew someone was watching me.

33
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,260
This room was completely devoid of sound.

34
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,640
No, I did hear something.

35
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,700
Sometimes I could hear screams coming from somewhere not too far away.

36
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:00,680
My food seemed to appear out of nowhere, and I counted the number of meals as I ate them.

37
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,460
Five.

38
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,000
Six.

39
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,580
Seven.

40
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,460
Eleven.

41
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,220
Twelve.

42
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,080
Thirteen.

43
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,340
Twenty-one.

44
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,780
Twenty-three.

45
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,600
when I couldn't keep track of them anymore.

46
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,600
There was this man, just standing there.

47
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,660
Listen to me closely.

48
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,800
People can become whatever they want to be.

49
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,520
What's this? Tell me, is it really all right for a young child like you to be wandering

50
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,360
around here?

51
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,720
You know, this child's the one.

52
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,800
Oh, so that's the child.

53
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,600
"Ma, you are a cute one."

54
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,860
"Ah, so this is the child."

55
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,000
"How wonderful!

56
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,560
What a beautiful child you are.

57
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,720
Take a good look.

58
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,080
This child is the one."

59
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,920
"Ah, so this is the one."

60
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,440
"Here's the result."

61
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,960
"The result indeed."

62
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,460
"This one's special."

63
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,000
"One in a million."

64
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:55,580
I remember a man standing there talking, but I can only remember parts of what he was saying.

65
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,420
For us the chosen ones a toast to our country's future

66
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,820
When the first person collapsed, all the people around him rushed to his side.

67
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,640
Then one by one, all of the other people in that room collapsed as well.

68
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,120
Their moans of pain, frenzied shrieks, the screams.

69
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,560
The whole room was engulfed with their fear.

70
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,920
On that fateful day, 42 people perished in that room.

71
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,660
The only one left alive was Franz Bonaparta.

72
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,780
I began to run.

73
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,940
I ran away, to escape that horrible place.

74
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,780
I didn't even realize my arm was bleeding from getting scratched by the roses in the

75
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,080
garden.

76
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,860
I just ran.

77
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,140
I ran all the way back to the three frogs.

78
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,100
You were still there.

79
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,640
You greeted me.

80
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,380
I started to tell you, for days and days.

81
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,880
Explaining all of my experiences, and what I had seen.

82
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,080
You're wrong.

83
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,220
You're so wrong.

84
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,080
You are wrong.

85
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,980
It's all wrong!

86
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,280
(suspenseful music)

87
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,120
Nina, can you hear me, Nina?

88
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,940
Just calm down, all right?

89
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,840
It's me, Tenma.

90
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,900
You know who I am, remember?

91
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,060
Hey, just relax. Calm down.

92
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,480
That's it. That's better now.

93
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,180
It's going to be alright. You're alright now.

94
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,820
It's not... It's not... No!

95
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,700
It wasn't me there!

96
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,500
It wasn't me who greeted him when he returned!

97
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,220
He wasn't the one who came back.

98
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,280
I remember it.

99
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,500
What I said was...

100
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,680
I'm back.

101
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,880
Welcome home.

102
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:25,980
"Yohan's mistaken. Yohan just listened to my story when I came back. Because the one

103
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:33,160
who was taken to the Red Rose Mansion... the one taken to the Red Rose Mansion, that child

104
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:53,020
The one who was dragged away down that wooden stairway at the Three Frogs, the one who counted

105
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,720
all those meals in that pitch black room that had no walls, the one who stood in that room

106
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,280
I'm surrounded by corpses.

107
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,960
That child was me!

108
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,720
It happened to me, all of it!

109
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,840
I'm scared.

110
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,940
I'm scared.

111
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,900
I'm so scared.

112
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,080
(breathing heavily)

113
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,320
(door creaking)

114
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,560
(breathing heavily)

115
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,980
(door creaking)

116
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,060
I'm back.

117
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,580
Welcome home.

118
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,520
(sniffling)

119
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,300
(whimpering)

120
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,580
(sobbing)

121
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,420
- Tell me everything.

122
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,900
- Everything?

123
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,440
All right, then.

124
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,000
I told him what happened. I talked to him for days and days.

125
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,680
That's enough, Nina.

126
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,740
I told Johan about all the terrible experiences I'd had, but Johan thinks my experiences...

127
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,200
Please just stop.

128
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,200
Somehow Johan really believes that my experiences actually happened to him.

129
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,360
Because I told him Johan had...

130
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,040
It's alright!

131
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,640
Just now, I told Johan everything.

132
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,780
It looked like he was laughing as he listened to me.

133
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,520
But it also looked like he was crying, too.

134
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,960
I've... I've never seen such an expression before.

135
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,880
His face... I've never seen anyone who looked like that.

136
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,640
I should have done it.

137
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,000
But I couldn't shoot him.

138
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,260
I'm sure of one thing.

139
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,100
He will destroy himself just like me.

140
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,860
I know that I will destroy myself.

141
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,140
No, you won't.

142
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,960
But don't you see that I have to do it?

143
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,140
Nina, no!

144
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,220
Don't do it.

145
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,740
Because if something happens to you,

146
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,600
if you die,

147
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,780
what will I do?

148
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,420
If you were to die,

149
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,500
How could I go without you, Nina?

150
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,400
You can't give up.

151
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,460
Please stay alive, no matter what else may happen.

152
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,540
I beg you, Nina.

153
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,160
Yeah, it's me.

154
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,100
So you're telling me you found his car near the villa, then.

155
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,960
Yes. It's at the bottom of the ravine.

156
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,660
I found Edward dead inside the car.

157
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,300
We all know who did this.

158
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,560
I can guess Johan's next move.

159
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,400
He'll kill Franz Bonaparte. That's who's next up on his list.

160
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,500
His son's in Prague. I told Johan where to find him.

161
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,240
I don't know what he's about to do with that information.

162
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,020
But, do you really think that's where all this will end?

163
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,280
Will his destruction actually come to an end there?

164
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,340
His sister Nina's memory.

165
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,000
Or something is missing from his sister's memory.

166
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,960
Johann has another one. It's part of him. Another memory.

167
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,400
What was our goal? What was it that we were trying to create?

168
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,280
What was our purpose?

169
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,300
Tell me, Franz Bonaparte.

170
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:11,200
It's alright, we'll find it, where you belong, where we belong, we'll find it somewhere.

171
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,680
I'm glad you came to visit.

172
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,900
I never expected to see you around here.

173
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,440
Well, make yourself at home.

174
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
I just made some hot tea.

175
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,520
I've always wanted to share my very best tea with you like this.

176
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,360
Do you like it?

177
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,320
What do you think of the flavor?

178
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,800
It's a special herbal blend of mine.

179
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,280
I must say I'm quite impressed you'd come here to pay me a personal visit.

180
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:16,240
I know this must be an important matter, so you need something done then. I'll handle whatever it is you need

181
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,820
Just tell me

182
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,080
Who do you want me to murder next?

183
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,060
Huh, hey, don't joke around like that Johan

184
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,720
Come on stop it. I woke up

185
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,400
I woke up from the dream.

186
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,140
Are you tired or something, Johan?

187
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,520
What are you going to do about the plan?

188
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,820
I said I woke up.

189
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,280
Hold on a minute.

190
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,560
If you've changed your mind, what did I collect all that money for anyway, huh?

191
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,100
I woke up from the dream.

192
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,740
So tell me then, what did I kill all those people for?

193
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,400
There were so many visions I had of the end.

194
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,760
But now, I'm picturing a different ending altogether.

195
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,740
A clearer vision of the true ending.

196
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,420
It's from a memory only I have.

197
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,980
The real place where I must be.
