The woman?

11
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,200
The woman was the only daughter of a grade school teacher in Moravia.

12
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,400
She was very beautiful with blonde hair and blue eyes.

She attended the University of Brno and majored in genetic engineering.

Oh, yeah, I was just saying what a great day this is.

180
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,440
Perfect weather out there.

181
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,300
Oh, yes.

182
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,380
I'm sorry, sir, but...

183
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,620
Yeah?

184
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,440
Could you go just a little faster?

185
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,080
Hang in there, kid.

186
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,880
Shoot me, Yana.

187
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,920
I'll save you, no matter what.

188
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,360
Are you going to shoot me, like you did back then?

189
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
That's right.

190
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,320
And that will be the end to all of this.

191
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,660
The end.

192
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,960
What exactly is the end?

193
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,420
The end.

194
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:15,260
The end. The end. The end. The end. The end. The end.

195
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,540
I've seen the end. Over and over.

196
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,300
What is the end?

197
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,180
This is. You're going to die. And so am I.

198
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,220
You've seen it.

199
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,300
What exactly did you see?

200
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,780
Tell me!

201
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,440
What did you see?

202
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,660
You don't know.

203
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,480
Do you?

204
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,120
I'll tell you about it.

205
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,240
It's something that's truly horrifying.

206
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,960
I'm back.

207
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,000
(dramatic music)
