You know, there's still time for you to turn yourself in and prove your innocence, Tenma.

I promise I can help you.

The truth is, I'm not chasing after Johan just so I can prove my innocence.

Thank you for all your help, Rudy.

Tenma, you don't have to become him to end this.

00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,540
That reminds me, I really didn't despise you back in college, Rudy.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,740
I thought you were brilliant, and it was a shame we never had a chance to talk.

I'm glad that I can finally count you as a friend.

But I know you caught me cheating on that medical law exam in Professor Hesse's class.

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,800
Well, yeah, I cheated on the medical law exam, too.

You know me better than that.

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,920
it up at the car rental place.

I don't remember you picking anything up.

They are amusing.

There is another possibility. He might just have left us and forgotten about us.

But just look at the lovely pastel colours the sun has left behind.

It's from the Palatinate region.

with quite a long list of criminals that I put behind bars. Oh. Come on, dear, we're

It's really not appropriate to brag about all your past exploits.

152
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,920
Well, I would look at a person's face and I'd know if he'd done the crime.

I think you've had a little too much wine.

However, after years on the job, I couldn't tell any more.

Was he guilty or innocent?

I couldn't spot the difference that had once seemed so clear.

161
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,540
It probably means I wasn't such a hot-shot detective after all.

162
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,240
Enough said.

163
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,240
Maybe I did have a little too much to drink.

It goes by so fast.

172
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,500
Yes.

173
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,340
Huh?

174
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,440
Oops, sorry.

175
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,880
It should be somewhere right around here.

176
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:59,040
for here's the address dear hmm almost there sorry but we have to make a stop

177
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,600
before continuing that's fine

178
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,380
Oh

179
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,640
Here we are the police

180
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,740
We won't be very long.

181
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,160
If you don't mind, you might as well wait in the car.

182
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,320
What should we do, Tenma?

183
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,460
Tenma!

184
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:57,520
Tenma! Let's run away!

185
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,920
What's wrong?

186
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,200
Someone's parked in one of the officer's only spaces again.

187
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,160
He looks foreign.

188
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,480
Guess I should report him.

189
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,120
Don't worry about it.

190
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,180
(sighs)

191
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,920
- What are we going to do?

192
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,020
- I don't know.

193
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,480
(engine starts)

194
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,080
Mr. Jones, we want to get to Fryham, and I don't know if you're aware of it, but you're

195
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,480
heading in the opposite direction.

196
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,820
That's right.

197
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,600
It's just a brief detour.

198
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,240
I want to stop at Steinbach Castle for a bit.

199
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
But dear...

200
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,580
Steinbach Castle?

201
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,960
Something I want to see for myself.

202
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,000
How are you doing?

203
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,860
Are you all right?

204
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:10,900
Yes.

205
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Oh, thank you.

206
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,500
Our son wrote us a letter about Steinbeck.

207
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,540
He said the view from this castle is truly breathtaking.

208
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,780
He wanted to bring us here so we could both see it.

209
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,400
- Oh, does your son live in Germany now?

210
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,880
- We're on our way to see him.

211
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,040
It's just that we have a few detours to make along the way.

212
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,620
(sighing)

213
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,680
- Wow.

214
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,920
This is the view he saw on that fateful day.

215
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,840
My son.

216
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,220
My son.

217
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,700
My own flesh and blood killed a man.

218
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,300
We came to this country to visit him because he'll never leave.

219
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,340
Well, we'll be okay from here. Thank you so much for everything.

220
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,600
Thank you. For your kindness and the pleasure of your company.

221
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,300
Cheerio, then. Look after yourself.

222
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,880
Such a nice young man.

223
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,100
Yes, isn't he?

224
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,980
It's hard to believe that he's wanted as the prime suspect in a series of murders.

225
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,800
That can't be. You must be mistaken.

226
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,640
No, I'm not. It's him. He's on the wanted suspects list.

227
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,580
Impossible.

228
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,520
I'm afraid so, and when we were at the station to speak to the detective who arrested Robert,

229
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,520
Tenma's photo was prominently posted on the wall.

230
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Unbelievable. There's so much good in him.

231
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,680
I know. I thought so too, and yet everyone seems convinced that he's guilty.

232
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,500
But my instincts keep telling me. He's an innocent man.

233
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,200
The good in him outweighs the bad, I'm sure of it.

234
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,680
It was unbelievable to think that Robert had committed murder, but he did, and the fact

235
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,840
that I couldn't sense what was going on with my own son made me realize it was time for

236
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,340
me to turn in my badge.

237
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,240
But you know something, dear?

238
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,560
I just want to be able to trust my instincts again.

239
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,640
Robert may have committed a crime, true, but I know he's a good boy at heart.

240
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,500
Come on. Let's go in and see our son.

241
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,200
Our dear Robert.
