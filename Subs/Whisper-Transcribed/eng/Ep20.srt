1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,040
Here. The least I can do is buy you a bus ticket.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,540
You know, there's still time for you to turn yourself in and prove your innocence, Tenma.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,320
I promise I can help you.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,220
The truth is, I'm not chasing after Johan just so I can prove my innocence.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,280
Hmm?

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,860
Thank you for all your help, Rudy.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,980
Tenma! You don't have to become him to end this.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,520
That reminds me. I really didn't despise you back in college, Rudy.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,740
I thought you were brilliant, and it was a shame we never had a chance to talk.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,840
I'm glad that I can finally count you as a friend.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,360
But I know you caught me cheating on that medical law exam in Professor Hesse's class.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,800
Well, yeah, I cheated on the medical law exam, too.

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,800
Be careful, Temma.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:26,860
What did that sign back there say?

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,080
Oh, sorry, dear. I missed it.

16
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,320
I've been trying to figure out this map is it this way or that way I'm not quite

17
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,720
sure we're headed in the right direction really where'd you find that map lying

18
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,020
in the street you know me better than that you were right beside me when I

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,360
picked it up at the car rental place I don't remember you picking anything up

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,080
you must have grabbed it when I went off to use the facilities they put in so

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,240
many place names with such small print at my age it's almost impossible to read

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,400
You could do it if you hadn't left your glasses at the airport.

23
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,640
There's Wippenhausen and Ampertshausen and here's Gartelhausen.

24
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,740
That's quite a mouthful, dear. These German names all sound alike, don't they?

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,700
They are amusing. I wonder if Germans think that about our towns when they read British maps.

26
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,660
Maybe, but right now we need to know when the next crossroad's coming up.

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,440
Hmm.

28
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
Look, there's a pedestrian.

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,600
Let's ask him for directions.

30
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,480
Let's not bother him. We can work it out ourselves.

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,320
Oh, the poor fellow. He's hitchhiking.

32
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,100
Let's give him a ride.

33
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,960
If you ask me, we're looking for trouble giving a ride to a complete stranger.

34
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,980
Maybe so.

35
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,380
Oh, wait a minute. He's travelling with a small child.

36
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,620
I feel sorry for them. Let's pick them up, all right?

37
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,340
Fine.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,840
Hey, look, Tenma. Those people just stopped for us.

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,640
You're right.

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:58,220
We'll be right back.

41
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:28,220
We'll see you next time.

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:58,220
To be continued...

43
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,940
traveling to. Oh, well, all right. We're around this area now, so it's just a bit further

44
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,100
south from here. Oh, that's splendid. We're headed in the same direction, aren't we, dear?

45
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,120
I suppose. Right then, it's settled. You two, hop in. DankeschÃ¶n.

46
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:28,760
you're quite an odd couple aren't you huh i mean i don't believe you're his father

47
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:36,960
you appear to be asian and the boy is clearly german caucasian ah yes in fact he's my best

48
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,940
friend's son and by all appearances i dare say you're some sort of well-educated professional man

49
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,640
It's the way you talk and carry yourself

50
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,300
I really must interrupt

51
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,780
That's quite enough, dear

52
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,780
It's that rude habit of yours

53
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,320
I must apologize for him

54
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,840
Sorry, it's not personal

55
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,880
He just enjoys observing people

56
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,360
Now that he's retired from the police force

57
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,240
What did she say?

58
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,180
Nothing

59
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,960
She just said that he used to be a cop

60
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:19,780
let's get out of here tenma easy so uh i've been thinking i'll bet this is the first real

61
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,720
vacation the two of you have taken since your husband retired yes you're right my husband was

62
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,280
such a workaholic i never truly believed we'd be able to take a big trip together but here we both

63
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,940
are sir i'm sorry we're imposing on this time you plan to spend with your wife we'd be happy to

64
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,980
catch another ride if we're being a nuisance here so far the biggest nuisance

65
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,060
has been getting lost because we can't read directions not to mention the

66
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,000
trouble we've been having ordering food it might help us immensely to have

67
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,240
someone like you traveling with us if only to interpret the bloody language

68
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,940
- Well, what shall we do now, dear?

69
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,940
- I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

70
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,940
- I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

71
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,940
- I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

72
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,940
- I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

73
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,940
- I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

74
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,940
- I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

75
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,940
- I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

76
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
- I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

77
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
- I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

78
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,940
- I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

79
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:42,660
well what should we do now dear hmm there's nothing we can do I'm afraid

80
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:54,780
except find a gas station and bring some back look here comes a truck hey what's

81
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,560
wrong we're out of gas that's kind of a problem out here in the middle of no

82
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:09,920
man's land huh hmm well I've got room for two of you in my cab is that okay

83
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,620
somebody should take the chap up on his offer don't worry about us we'll be all

84
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:25,340
right we'll work something out listen as soon as I see a gas station I'll get

85
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,000
them to send somebody out here with a can of gas for you thank you that would

86
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That would be most helpful, and we'd really appreciate it.

87
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
This is great.

88
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank goodness, right, Tenma?

89
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Everything worked out perfectly.

90
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:10,620
How long do you think it will be before we come to a gas station?

92
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,820
Don't remember there being any around.

93
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:42,260
it's been quite a while now indeed it has my dear with that nice young man lets them know

94
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,780
that was stranded out here on the motorway the petrol station will send someone out won't they

95
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:55,640
there is another possibility hmm he might just have left us and forgotten about us I don't

96
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,240
believe it he's not that kind of person he struck me as a very caring man maybe

97
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,780
not

98
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,240
what a beautiful sky I'm not really in the mood to enjoy a sunset tonight see

99
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:31,400
one you've seen them all oh i'm not talking about the sunset the sun's already disappeared

100
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,400
but just look at the lovely pastel colors the sun has left behind

101
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,360
it's like a watercolor painting in the sky

102
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,400
i wonder if robert's watching it now we'd be seeing it together

103
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:52,180
My goodness. Is that... I think it is.

104
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,680
Dear, you'd better take a look. My eyes might be deceiving me.

105
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,820
Someone's coming this way.

106
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,300
It's getting bright and closer.

107
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,180
It must be him. I just knew it.

108
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:21,560
I couldn't find a gas station.

109
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
I borrowed the gas and a lamp from a farmer.

110
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,920
Oh, my.

111
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,280
See, I told you.

112
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,480
Hmm.

113
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:22,460
Oh, that was a delicious meal, wasn't it, dear?

114
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,920
Thanks to your excellent translation of the German menu,

115
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,880
we were actually able to order something we could enjoy tonight.

116
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:31,680
Right?

117
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,160
Especially that wine.

118
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,220
Oh, it was four-star Ungeheuer.

119
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,260
It's from the Palatinate region.

120
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
That liver dish was just scrumptious.

121
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,140
The liver canoodle?

122
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,720
That's how it's pronounced.

123
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,620
It melted in my mouth.

124
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,580
If you hadn't been with us, we'd have passed all these wonderful places

125
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,360
without a clue as to what we were missing.

126
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,280
I want to thank you for treating us to dinner.

127
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,940
You're almost finished.

128
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,080
Would you like some more to take with you?

129
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,460
Thanks, but if he has any more, he'll burst.

130
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,180
Do you think this bloke looks like a criminal?

131
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,960
This chap here, he's on trial for murdering his wife

132
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,640
and there's a big picture of him in the paper.

133
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,560
See for yourself.

134
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,600
What's your opinion?

135
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,140
Do you think he did it?

136
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,360
Well, um, who can tell, really?

137
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,220
Before I retired from the force,

138
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,040
I was a detective with quite a long list of criminals

139
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,580
that I'd put behind bars.

140
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,580
Oh.

141
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,900
Come on, dear, we're enjoying the evening.

142
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,160
It's really not appropriate to brag about all your past exploits.

143
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,260
Well, I would look at a person's face

144
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,900
and I'd know if he'd done the crime.

145
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,100
I possessed an uncanny knack for spotting the guilt that a person tries

146
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,940
to hide I see let's talk about something else now dear I think you've had a

147
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:57,320
little too much wine however after years on the job I couldn't tell anymore

148
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:05,740
was one person good and another bad was he guilty or innocent I couldn't spot

149
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,200
the difference that had once seemed so clear it probably means I wasn't such a

150
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,880
hot-shot detective after all

151
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:26,740
enough said maybe I did have a little too much to drink and tell me once more

152
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:35,300
what was the name of that wine it was forced rolling Goyer Oh excellent bouquet

153
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:45,740
âªâª

154
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:55,740
âªâª

155
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:14,240
How cute. They each have a friend.

156
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,960
When this trip is over, Dieter, and you move to a new place,

157
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,820
I hope you make lots of friends.

158
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,320
Oh, sure. That'd be great.

159
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,220
Everyone should have a happy childhood.

160
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,200
They should enjoy every minute.

161
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
It goes by so fast.

162
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,500
Yes.

163
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,360
Huh?

164
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,420
Oops, sorry.

165
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,860
It should be somewhere right around here.

166
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,300
What are you looking for?

167
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,020
Here's the address, dear.

168
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:59,820
Hmm. Almost there. Sorry, but we have to make a stop before continuing.

169
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,740
That's fine.

170
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,380
Oh, here we are.

171
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:14,560
Hmm?

172
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,620
The police.

173
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:36,740
We won't be very long.

174
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,140
If you don't mind, you might as well wait in the car.

175
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,340
What should we do, Tenma?

176
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,520
Tenma, let's run away.

177
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,900
What's wrong?

178
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,200
Someone's parked in one of the officer's only spaces again.

179
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
He looks foreign. Guess I should report him.

180
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,760
Eh, don't worry about it.

181
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,900
What are we going to do?

182
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,040
I don't know.

183
00:17:53,020 --> 00:18:03,020
âªâª

184
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:13,020
âªâª

185
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:21,020
âªâª

186
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:26,780
mr. Jones we want to get to fry home and I don't know if you're aware of it but

187
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,060
you're heading in the opposite direction hmm that's right it's just a brief

188
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:39,140
detail I want to stop at Steinbach Castle for a bit but dear Steinbach

189
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,540
Castle was something I want to see for myself

190
00:18:51,020 --> 00:19:09,860
How are you doing? Are you all right?

191
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:10,900
Yes.

192
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,720
Oh, thank you.

193
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:29,480
Our son wrote us a letter about Steinbach.

194
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,540
He said the view from this castle is truly breathtaking.

195
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,760
He wanted to bring us here so we could both see it.

196
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,400
Oh, does your son live in Germany now?

197
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,880
We're on our way to see him.

198
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,040
It's just that we have a few detours to make along the way.

199
00:19:51,020 --> 00:20:02,700
This is the view he saw on that fateful day.

200
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,820
My son.

201
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,220
My son.

202
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,700
My own flesh and blood killed a man.

203
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,700
We came to this country to visit him

204
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,560
because he'll never leave.

205
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,740
- Well, we'll be okay from here.

206
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,840
Thank you so much for everything.

207
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,240
- Thank you for your kindness

208
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,940
and the pleasure of your company.

209
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,440
Cheerio, then.

210
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,520
Look after yourself.

211
00:20:50,700 --> 00:21:00,940
such a nice young man yes isn't he it's hard to believe that he's wanted as the prime suspect in

212
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:09,620
a series of murders that can't be you must be mistaken no i'm not it's him he's on the wanted

213
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:15,500
suspects list impossible i'm afraid so and when we were at the station to speak to the detective

214
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,520
who arrested Robert,

215
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,520
Tenma's photo was prominently posted on the wall.

216
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,300
Unbelievable.

217
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,840
There's so much good in him.

218
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,720
I know.

219
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,220
I thought so too,

220
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,660
and yet everyone seems convinced that he's guilty.

221
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,000
But my instincts keep telling me

222
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,520
he's an innocent man.

223
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,160
The good in him outweighs the bad,

224
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,180
I'm sure of it.

225
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,980
Hmm.

226
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,160
It was unbelievable to think

227
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,500
that Robert had committed murder but he did and the fact that I couldn't sense

228
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,580
what was going on with my own son made me realize it was time for me to turn in

229
00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:02,400
my badge but you know something dear I just want to be able to trust my

230
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,600
instincts again Robert may have committed a crime true but I know he's a

231
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
He's a good boy at heart.

232
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Come on.

233
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Let's go in and see our son.

234
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Our dear Robert.
