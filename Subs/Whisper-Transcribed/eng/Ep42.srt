Sir, this man was the first to arrive at the Pedrov murder scene yesterday.

27
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,400
Ah, Mr. Grimmer.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,440
Sorry about having to keep you here at the station overnight.

29
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,420
I, uh, slipped and dropped my nail clipper under my desk.

30
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,020
Yeah, when you're a guy my size, seems like you bump into everything.

31
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,620
Oh.

32
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,020
Hey, you're a pretty tall guy yourself.

33
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,980
Yeah, I find I bump into a lot of things as well.

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,480
Anyway, I'm in charge of this murder case.

35
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,380
My name is Zemon.

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,620
Hi, I'm Grimmer.

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,860
All right, please have a seat.

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,900
I was just in the middle of clipping my nails,

39
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,680
so I hope you don't mind me finishing them.

40
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,520
Go right ahead.

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,600
My wife's always nagging me about it.

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,700
If my nails start to grow out, she

43
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,080
really doesn't like that at all.

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,960
She can't stand seeing the white part.

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,920
So, thanks to her, sometimes I wind up cutting them too short.

46

Oh, yikes.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,420
Well, that must have been a terrible scene yesterday.

48
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,080
Yeah.

49
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,540
I mean, who would have thought something like that would happen?

50
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,520
I understand you're a freelance newspaper journalist, is that right?

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,080
I imagine you might have known about the murder victim's past.

52
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,520
Mikhail Leonidovich Petrov.

53
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,600
That's him.

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
His real name was Reinhard Biermann.

55
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,880
He was an East German.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,960
After Germany's reunification, he

57
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
was accused of various illegal activities,

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,740
including suppression of human rights,

59
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,560
illegal detention of minors, and several charges

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,840
of extreme child abuse.

61
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,780
He escaped here to the Czech Republic

62
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,960
right after the wall fell.

63
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,260
The German government maintained the charges against him,

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,640
but we chose not to extradite him,

65
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,160
allowed him to be free, and kept him under surveillance.

66
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,540
Is that so?

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,600
Indeed.

68
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,360
We kept an eye on him and found he

69
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,540
secret police types.

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,360
- Why the Czech secret police?

71
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,960
- You know how brutal their tactics were

72
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,240
when it came to restricting free speech and thought

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,580
during the Cold War, don't you?

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,540
Well, they also gave their support

75
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,700
to the terrorist activities

76
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,820
of some extreme leftist organizations.

77
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,640
Be that as it may, though,

78
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,260
with the peaceful separation

79
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,120
and subsequent democratization

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,160
of the Czech Republic and Slovakia,

81
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,660
they went underground without being noticed

82
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,340
and without causing any trouble.

83
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,280
That's who Pedroff was in contact with before he died.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,240
We think he was probably selling them information, he had.

85
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,300
What we have yet to ascertain is--

86
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,440

96

97
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,400
the boys said they saw a woman leaving,

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,680

103
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm curious.

104
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,940

I'll be back at the station in about an hour.

182
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,180
I'll see you then.

183
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,800
Guys, I think that's probably enough, or he won't be able to talk.

184
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,700
So, Grimmer, now do you feel like talking?

185
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,980
Where's the key, huh?

186
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,040
Look, I don't know what this key is that you keep talking about.

187
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Wait, let me reason with him.

188
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,760
Mr. Krimmer, it's really pointless of you to try to hide it from us.

189
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,480
That safety deposit box key Pedrov gave you, where is it?

190
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,260
Well, like I said before, I can't tell you what I don't know.

191
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,660
I gotcha. You want money, don't you?

192
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,680
Well then, let's make a deal here.

193
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,560
How much are we talking about?

194
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,060
Nothing. I may be a hack journalist, but at least I make enough at it to keep myself fed.

195
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,300
Mr. Grimmer.

196
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,180
What a mess. This is just not right.

197
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,220
You know, my wife would say your nails are in desperate need of a trim.

198
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,080
I told you how she likes them, didn't I?

199
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,920
Why'd you do that? You shouldn't move.

200
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,540
Now, let's try again.

201
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,400
So, where is it? Where's the key?

202
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,500
I asked where.

203
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,300
Even if you did visit that bank,

204
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,420
and you're able to open the safety deposit box with the key,

205
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,580
and you got the tape and the data,

206
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,020
it wouldn't be of use to you.

207
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,260
Who possesses that tape is of extreme importance to the organization.

208
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,800
They're trying to do something big.

209
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,480
They're going to restore the Eastern Bloc to its former glory.

210
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:14,620
The exact identity of the monster is recorded on that tape of Pedroff's, and they need to

211
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,200
know everything about that monster.

212
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,860
That monster is like a king.

213
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,460
That monster can unite them all.

214
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,240
All of those orphans from 511 Kinderheim.

215
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,120
Yes, those children were selected to be communists of the highest order.

216
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,400
The 5-1-1 Kinderheim Group was the most elite group that East Germany had.

217
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
And the monster can summon all of them to do his bidding.

218
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,680
It's been said that he was able to control all of the workings of 5-1-1 Kinderheim,

219
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,580
and that he was the one who had it destroyed in the end.

220
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,580
He's a real monster, and the only person who could unite that elite group.

221
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,740
All right, now where's the key?

222
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,500
Hmm

223
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,300
You think they're an elite group

224
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,960
What's all funny

225
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,740
Why the hell are you laughing

226
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:31,440
What do you want? Is it money you're after I get it. I'm a capitalist. Hey, I love having lots of money

227
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,380
I'm not taking sides

228
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,880
I just want to sell them Pedroff's tapes so they give me a load of cash.

229
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,280
What's your angle on this?

230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,740
Is this all for social justice?

231
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,340
There's no reason for you to go this far for that.

232
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,340
Just who are you, really?

233
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,960
You say you're a journalist from the Old Eastern Bloc,

234
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,880
but most of those folks were agents for government intelligence.

235
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,120
In fact, the very best of those agents were spies.

236
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,100
Who was it that sent you here?

237
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,780
What? You think you're a super-spy?

238
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,320
Huh. Sure.

239
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,900
I'll just bring you around!

240
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,520
You're going to die if you don't talk.

241
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,080
Okay, this is your last chance. Where's the key?

242
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,040
You ever hear of the Magnificent Steiner?

243
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:37,920
[coughing]

244
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,640
It was a cartoon that was on TV in West Germany in the 1960s.

245
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,100
The signal was so strong, you could even watch it in East Berlin.

246
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,900
The main character was a pencil necked weakling,

247
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,280
but when he'd get into a really dangerous fix,

248
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,880
This secret friend of his would come and save him, and beat his enemies to a pulp.

249
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,720
However, the main character never saw this secret friend of his.

250
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,980
He always blacked out before he arrived.

251
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,760
One day, he realized his special friend was himself.

252
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,260
And whenever he got into a situation that was truly desperate,

253
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,620
He would somehow transform into the terrifying Magnificent Steiner.

254
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,160
When he came to, he'd find all the evildoers bleeding at his feet.

255
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,660
This transformation made him unstoppable.

256
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,540
Well, you better transform.

257
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,380
Come on, transform right now.

258
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,020
Pour some water on him.

259
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,660
He'll tell us about it soon.

260
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,260
(crickets chirping)

261
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,180
- And who are you?

262
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,280
(eerie music)

263
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,760
(dramatic music)

264
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,780
(gunshot)

265
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,520
(groaning)

266
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,560
- What happened?

267
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,520
(groaning)

268
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,280
A woman came in and...

269
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
[GROANING]

270
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,220
[MUSIC PLAYING]

271
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:49,060
A woman came in, and I heard a single gunshot, and one of those men was shot in the head.

272
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,560
[GUNSHOTS]

273
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,640
But on the other two bodies, there weren't any bullet holes.

274
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,820
[GUNSHOTS]

275
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:58,980

(gentle music)

278
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,600
The Magnificent Steiner.

279
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,780
I did it again.

280
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,160
