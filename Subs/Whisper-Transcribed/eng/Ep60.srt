00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,500
Are you taking care of yourself?

182
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,820
You're looking pretty thin to me.

183
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,340
Yeah.

184
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,640
It's strange.

185
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,780
Here we are holding Martin's funeral like this over cups of weak diner coffee.

186
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,960
He was a good person.

187
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,120
I did heartless things to such a good man.

188
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,200
I treated him badly.

189
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,920
It's horrible.

190
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,060
I made him wear the same suit and necktie I gave you a long time ago.

191
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,600
It was a cruel joke.

192
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,000
How heartless and horrible I really am.

193
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,200
I'm so mean. Why am I still alive?

194
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,560
Please tell me.

195
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,580
Look what I've done to you.

196
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,320
I even lied about you to make you look guilty.

197
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,240
How have I survived to this point

198
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,340
considering all the bad things that I've done.

199
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,460
- You're alive because Martin protected you.

200
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,720
- Why the hell did he do that?

201
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,920
Why would someone like him protect someone like me?

202
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,520
- Because nobody wants to die.

203
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,220
That's what Martin said to me at the end.

204
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,360
Just knowing that you'd be here,

205
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,680
waiting at the station.

206
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,300
He told me it made him happy.

207
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,520
You aren't safe here.

208
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,920
Go to Munich.

209
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,940
I know a psychiatrist who lives there.

210
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,980
You mean Dr. Reikvein?

211
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,340
You know him already?

212
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,340
I do.

213
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:26,320
He's a good man. Dr. Reikvein will find a safe place for you. I promise he'll take good care of you.

214
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,480
Then go straight to the police. Tell them that the baby and his organization are after you, and they want you dead.

215
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,020
They'll also need to know that Roberto's after you. You're going to have to tell them everything.

216
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,260
I can tell them about you, too. That you haven't killed anyone.

217
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,340
I'll explain Johan did it all. I'll tell them everything.

218
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,540
So please come to Munich with me.

219
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,680
But he's right in front of me, Eva.

220
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,200
He's so close now. You saw him at the party, didn't you?

221
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,900
At last I have Johan right in front of me.

222
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,100
I've got to end this.

223
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,620
I can't let there be any more victims like Martin.

224
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,980
Do you understand?

225
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,220
Ava, I have to end this.

226
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,980
I'll send a letter to Dr. Reikvein.

227
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,220
I'll give him all the information I have,

228
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,920
In addition to whatever you can tell him, in person.

229
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,680
Oh, Kenzo...

230
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,500
Your train's about to leave.

231
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,180
But Kenzo, I think I could help more if...

232
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,400
The best way to help me is by doing one thing.

233
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,020
Go to Munich and tell the authorities everything you know about this.

I'm quite grateful to you.

238
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,780
I'd been told there was someone who matched his description here in Frankfurt.

239
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,820
That's precisely why I asked for your assistance in this matter.

240

Excuse me for interrupting your dinner, sir, but you have a phone call.

Fine.

Johan?

00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,820
I see. Where is he?

245
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,380
He's at an apartment on Haldekker Street.

Yeah.
