1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,740
How many times do you plan on coming here?

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,700
You can ask me until you're blue in the face.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,680
I'm always going to tell you the same thing.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,960
Look, Councilman Boltzmann didn't have sex with that woman, that prostitute.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,980
This had better be your last visit.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,780
I would hate to have to take action against you.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,620
Take action? Are you going to sue for defamation?

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,680
No, you wouldn't dare.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,160
You're his secretary.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,540
You wouldn't want Councilman Boltzmann's name to come up in a case like this.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,560
Inspector, are you threatening me?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,220
No, of course not.

13
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,280
I simply want to know the truth of the matter, that's all.

14
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,620
I know he works for a hotshot politician, but man, that guy's not going to give an inch.

15
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:08,780
No.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,120
He'll come around.

17
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,920
got a pretty good thing going here.

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,420
Why risk it all on some random prostitute?

19
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,200
The victim was no ordinary prostitute.

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,880
The names of countless politicians and businessmen

21
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,100
were traced back to her.

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
Well, yeah, but there's only one person

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,160
who claims to have seen them both at the same hotel.

24
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,640
Just because they stayed at the same hotel

25
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,900
doesn't make them a John.

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,560
Have you decoded her client list for me?

27
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,600
Actually, we're still working on cracking that code.

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,180
It's a lot tougher than we thought.

29
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,260
myself. Just give me the disk. Great, but don't you already have a bunch of other

30
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,060
cases on your plate? It doesn't matter. Give it to me. Um, there's something I've

31
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,860
been meaning to ask you for a while. What is it? Well, how do you find the time to

32
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,600
sleep? What does that have to do with the case? Huh? It's an irrelevant question,

33
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:12,820
detective well have you gotten the chance to talk to him it doesn't really

34
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,920
matter when we tell him he doesn't listen he stopped listening to me a long

35
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,600
time ago I know but the sooner you tell him the better keep it down you're being

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,780
too loud he's here you know working in his office yeah I wonder why

37
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,500
Damn it!

38
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,940
Are you still trying to connect Councilman Boltzmann to the murder of that prostitute,

39
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,360
Lungay?

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,320
Is there a problem with that, Chief?

41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,240
Yes, there's a problem with that.

42
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,620
I'm getting all sorts of grief from the Ministry of the Interior.

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,120
You're just going to have to smooth things out like you usually do.

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,720
No!

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
I can't unburn any more bridges for you.

46
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,020
It's too big.

47
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,620
Do whatever you can, Chief.

48
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,760
Give me a break here, Lungay!

49
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,400
You're good, but you're only human.

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,940
and sometimes you're gonna be wrong.

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,500
Are you gonna risk your entire career on a dead hooker?

52
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,580
Come on, do you need another feather in your cap?

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,540
Oh God, don't tell me you're doing this

54
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,940
for the principle of the thing.

55
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,260
- Fame, justice, I'm not interested in either.

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,840
All I know is a woman was murdered in cold blood.

57
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,100
I'm just interested in finding the killer.

58
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,560
Nothing else matters to me.

59
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,020
- Lunge!

60
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,280
Uh, excuse me, Inspector.

61
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,560
You have a visitor.

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,420
Got it.

63
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,180
Huh?

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,400
I managed to figure out the encryption that she was using.

65
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,340
Use this formula to get all the names on her client list.

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:50,800
Oh.

67
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,860
Um, that woman is here again, sir.

68
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,800
You know the one.

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,560
Ava Heinemann?

70
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,500
Hey, you can't just come back here.

71
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,720
We've been over this before.

72
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,740
When will Tenma be arrested? You have all you need.

73
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,380
It seems like you've been drinking quite a bit this morning.

74
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, of course I've been drinking.

75
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,540
Just so you know, I've already figured out the case regarding Dr. Tenma.

76
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,140
Huh?

77
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,860
He insists that everything is the work of a man called Johan.

78
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,280
But this Johan is just another personality within Tenma's mind.

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,860
If you think about it, with this hypothesis,

80
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,560
What seemed illogical now makes sense.

81
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,540
All we have to do at this point

82
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,780
is just wait for the police to capture him.

83
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,300
So that means it's not your problem

84
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,680
once you've got an arrest warrant.

85
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,660
Is that what you're saying?

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,300
There are a lot of things I would like to ask him

87
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,400
when we finally meet.

88
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,920
Dr. Tenma.

89
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,640
What an interesting individual he is.

90
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,100
However, I have so many other cases

91
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,180
piling up on my desk as we speak.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,480
[knocking]

93
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,180
If you'll excuse me.

94
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:04,380
Don't you people ever let up? I told you, Councilman Boltzmann has an alibi for that

95
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,420
night. An alibi? Of course he did. The murder was a professional. I'm sorry, are you honestly

96
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,440
suggesting that my employer hired a hitman to kill that girl? Ridiculous. I've cracked

97
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,580
the code on the list of clients of the woman who was killed. Councilman Boltzmann's name

98
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,340
You know, even if that were the case, it still doesn't prove that he had her killed.

99
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,720
Right. Come to think of it, that's as far as we've gotten.

100
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,360
I'm sure you'll be in touch. Now leave.

101
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,100
We're dead in the water without a smoking gun, wouldn't you say?

102
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,000
Are you familiar with a publishing house called Shellhorn?

103
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,680
They're not a major company,

104
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,820
but they stay in business by publishing tell-all books on famous people, like politicians.

105
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,460
to play very dirty.

106
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,720
They hire unscrupulous women

107
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,040
to build relationships with famous men

108
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,740
in order to create scandals to write about.

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,580
If I were you, I'd watch out for people like that.

110
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,720
(grunting)

111
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,500
Check and mate. You should have seen it. It was great. Boltzmann's guy just stared at

112
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,420
him like, "What?" Lunge is unbelievable. Near as I can tell, all he does is work. He's a

113
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:47,880
robot, I'm telling you. Man, I hear you. The guy barely seems human to me. Huh? Oh, right.

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,520
Speaking of checkmate, there it is. What the hell? Hey, don't butt into our game, buddy.

115
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,300
Don't waste your time with mind-numbing games.

116
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,600
It seems after a simple little threat,

117
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,560
the president of the publishing company chose to confess.

118
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,740
Write a report.

119
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,400
Right away!

120
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:03,840
Yes, sir!

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,000
Here.

122
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,020
What do you think you're looking at?

123
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,880
It's that call girl's notebook.

124
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,980
It records the date and time

125
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,000
and other details of encounters with a certain client.

126
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,200
I can't really tell you the man's name.

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,580
He's only referred to here by the initial "B."

128
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,620
Not to mention, Shellhorn Publishing

129
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,460
also made arrangements with the woman

130
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,320
to release her autobiography.

131
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,800
Interesting, don't you think?

132
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,860
Oh, by the way,

133
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,920
have you ever been in contact with a man named Yanker?

134
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,280
You may be aware that he is a professional hitman.

135
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,700
I want you to leave.

136
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,680
You get the hell out of here now!

137
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,340
We're moving out, both of us, right now.

138
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,080
Level with me.

139
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,980
You never even noticed I was pregnant.

140
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,540
Not even now, did you?

141
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,200
Are you going to the man who fathered your child?

142
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,440
What do you care?

143
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,000
I bet you didn't even notice that I was having an affair with another man, did you?

144
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,360
Yes.

145
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,640
Inspector, it's me.

146
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,140
Mintok.

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,300
Baltimore's secretary.

148
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,340
Look, I'll tell you everything, but you need to get over here right now.

149
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,100
Please.

150
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,400
Understood.

151
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,580
I have to go.

152
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,900
We can talk about this later.

153
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,960
[GUNSHOT]

154
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,000
[GUNSHOT]

155
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:47,980
[GUNSHOT]

156
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,020
Inspector!

157
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,040
What just happened here?

158
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,260
The secretary!

159
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,680
He committed suicide!

160
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,320
(trumpet fanfare)

161
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,240
- Councilman Boltzmann's an innocent man.

162
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,180
Not much of a suicide note,

163
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,740
Lungay, I'm handing this one over to Inspector Kaminsky.

164
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,180
I'm giving him the Reichner Park and Gallen murder cases, too.

165
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,700
Given what happened, I think it's for the best.

166
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,840
So then, what am I supposed to do now?

167
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,940
Get your head together.

168
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,300
Then we'll talk about work.

169
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,740
Well, Dr. Tenma, it seems there's nothing left to distract me.

170
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:40,880
Sorry, Inspector. You have a visitor. It's Eva Heinemann. I could tell her to come back

171
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,120
another day if you know. No, show her in.

172
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,760
I had a great time, Eva.

173
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,340
How long

174
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,700
- Until next time.

175
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,800
- Not sure, babe.

176
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,080
Maybe when I return for my next business trip.

177
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,020
- Oh, I don't want to give you back to your wife.

178
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,840
Come on, stay.

179
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,820
(laughing)

180
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,960
- All right.

181
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,540
I'll give you a call.

182
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,780
- No, you won't be coming back.

183
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,940
Not after getting in trouble for that perfumed handkerchief

184
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,660
that I carefully placed in your suitcase.

185
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,880
You stupid bastard.

186
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
- You were eavesdropping again, weren't you?

187
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,640
You must see all the different men I'm with,

188
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,380
isn't that right?

189
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,020
- No. - Well, what then?

190
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,980
You wanna join in the fun, is that it?

191
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,500
- No, of course not.

192
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,320
- You pervert. - You're wrong.

193
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,000
I mean, I just--

194
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,640
- I forget how nice it is.

195
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,440
It's beautiful.

196
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,600
I really love this garden.

197
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Looking at all this greenery helps me forget

198
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,660
about the distasteful things out there.

199
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
- Well, I'm so glad that you like it.

200
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,460
I'm going to plant some mimosas here.

201
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,640
And over there, I'm planning to put up an arch for your roses.

202
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,280
When summer gets here, it's going to be beautiful.

203
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,740
- I'm wondering if maybe someone like you

204
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,940
could be up to the task.

205
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,720
- Uh...

206
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,760
- So what do you think?

207
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,760
Do you think you can make me happy?

208
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,080
- Dad?

209
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,040
Hey, Dad, are you listening to me?

210
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,400
Dad!

211
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,360
- Huh?

212
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,520
Oh, how is my cooking today? Am I getting any better?

213
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,640
You haven't heard a single word I said, have you, Dad?

214
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,860
How come you're always daydreaming?

215
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,480
I bet you that's why Mom ran off with another man.

216
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,380
Oh, I'm sorry.

217
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,520
It's fine, really.

218
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,140
Actually, Coletta?

219
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,480
Yeah?

220
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,980
If Daddy, um, found someone he really liked...

221
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:10,720
Huh?

222
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,260
Um, no, forget it. It's nothing.

223
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,280
My cooking is pretty awful, right?

224
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,820
Come on, tell the truth.

225
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,960
It's not so bad.

226
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,700
I see. Not bad, huh?

227
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,360
Sorry for the trouble.

228
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,700
You're a gardener, but I'm asking you to do all these odd jobs.

229
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,460
No problem.

230
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,420
My handyman kept asking for time off and then quit.

231
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,140
Well, I'll do everything I can to help.

232
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,300
(birds chirping)

233
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:36,820
- Huh?

234
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,540
- So, how about dinner tonight?

235
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,900
- Oh, well, uh, okay.

236
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,420
Huh.

237
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,900
- Why are you nervous?

238
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,540
- Well, I'm not used to expensive restaurants like this.

239
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,180
- If you want to be a man worthy of my company,

240
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,220
you must be confident wherever you go.

241
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,120
Just pretend you're working in my garden right now.

242
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,780
Um, yes, that's right.

243
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,980
I do feel pretty confident when I'm out there

244
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,660
working on something new in the yard.

245
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,840
I feel so satisfied when a garden turns out

246
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,060
the way I envisioned it.

247
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,260
I just love being out there, you know?

248
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,100
People who like gardens can't be all that bad.

249
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,840
And you did say you liked that garden the other day.

250
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,660
Are you trying to say that I'm a good person?

251
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,100
Yeah, of course.

252
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,320
[laughing]

253
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,600
But you...

254
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,940
You seem, you know, kind of lonely.

255
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,960
I'm not the only one.

256
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,200
I'm guessing that you're lonely, too.

257
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,640
Um, I'm sorry.

258
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,280
My daughter's probably worried about me, so I should get going.

259
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,220
Kenzo...

260
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,380
Kenzo...

261
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,340
(moaning)

262
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,460
- It's almost Christmas, Coletta.

263
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,780
- You should tell Santa he doesn't have to come this year.

264
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,520
- Hey, come on, sweetie, don't say things like that.

265
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,180
- Dad, celebrating Christmas just the two of us

266
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,820
sounds lonely.

267
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,520
Let's not do anything, okay?

268
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
- Yeah, well, it might not just be the two of us

269
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,580
The man you're looking at in those photographs ruined my life.

270
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,720
S-sorry.

271
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,320
I was just cleaning up.

272
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,220
His name is Kenzo Tenma.

273
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,980
He's my ex-fiancé.

274
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,920
Y-you're drinking again at this time of day?

275
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,620
Well, of course I've been drinking.

276
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,520
I just went to see Inspector Lungay of the BKA.

277
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,060
Can you believe that useless, incompetent inspector sent me away?

278
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,200
All I want to know is when they're going to arrest Tenma!

279
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,240
The BKA? Arrest?

280
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,000
He killed my father and then ran away!

281
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,820
Oh, he says he's innocent, but he's not fooling anybody!

282
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,480
My future should have been gilded in gold as the daughter of the director of a large hospital!

283
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,840
And my three divorces? Everything is his fault!

284
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,220
And he blames the murders on Johan!

285
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,220
"This is Yohan with my father. Do you think that this child could kill anyone?"

286
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,340
"Is that really what Tenma told you?"

287
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,200
"It's utter nonsense."

288
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,360
"Have you ever shown this photograph to the police?"

289
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,120
"Of course not. Why would I?"

290
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,840
"Well, I don't know. It could be important evidence, maybe."

291
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,410
"Tenma's the one who did it! Like Lungei says, he has a split personality, dammit!"

292
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:18,410
Then tell me, why do you still keep framed pictures of him like this around the house years later?

293
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,450
I figure deep down, you think Tenma is innocent.

294
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,990
You still have feelings for him.

295
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,450
You watch too many soap operas.

296
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,710
Out of all the men I've ever met, Kenzo satisfied the most of my requirements.

297
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,410
His position suited me.

298
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,530
a neurosurgeon who many considered a genius.

299
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,450
Besides, he spoiled me,

300
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,610
and best of all, he never contradicted me.

301
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,890
He just listened to my every single request.

302
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,790
Yes, yes, yes!

303
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,110
He was the man who always said yes to me!

304
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,890
That man could've made me the happiest person in the world!

305
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,410
Do you understand what I'm saying?

306
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,270
- Do you think I would ever be able to fill his shoes?

307
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,090
I'd be willing to tend your gardens

308
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,370
for the rest of my life,

309
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,750
if that would help to ease your pain, Eni.

310
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,710
(dramatic music)

311
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,490
(laughing)

312
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,590
- Don't flatter yourself,

313
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,450
just because I slept with you once.

314
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,350
You were just something to pass the time.

315
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,770
I was bored, that's all.

316
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,910
I was playing with you, and you fell for it.

317
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,910
You fool.

318
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,590
Who do you think you are?

319
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,410
(laughing)

320
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,270
Ava, you are truly a sad and lonely person.

321
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,910
So are you!

322
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,950
On Christmas Day, I'm having a party at my house with my daughter.

323
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,710
You're welcome to join us.

324
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,370
(laughing)

325
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,230
- Wow, Dad, everything looks delicious.

326
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,390
Did you really make this all by yourself?

327
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,310
- Yep, I can't guarantee it'll be good.

328
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,850
- But isn't this way too much for the two of us?

329
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,550
- Do you think so?

330
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,450
- Mom's coming home for Christmas, huh?

331
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,630
I'm right, aren't I? Well, aren't I, Dad?

332
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,710
Coletta...

333
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,990
It's Mom! She's home!

334
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,590
Char...Charlotta...

335
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,610
I'm so sorry dear. I'm sorry

336
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:46,770
Who cares about mimosas, or about roses, or beautiful gardens, or this whole damn estate?

337
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,050
None of it means anything to me now!

338
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,270
Welcome back.

339
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,750
So Inspector Lungay, you finally decided to listen to me.

340
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,550
I had some time open up, that's all.

341
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,430
This man was my only hope.

342
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:25,770
I must see to it that his life is ruined, or I can never be happy again.

343
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,810
[MUSIC]

344
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,510
(gentle music)
