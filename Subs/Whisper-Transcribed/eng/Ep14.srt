1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
How many times do you plan on coming here?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,700
You can ask me until you're blue in the face.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,660
I'm always going to tell you the same thing.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,960
Look, Councilman Boltzmann didn't have sex with that woman, that prostitute.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,960
This had better be your last visit.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,780
I would hate to have to take action against you.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,620
Take action? Are you going to sue for defamation?

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,700
No, you wouldn't dare.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,160
You're his secretary.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,560
You wouldn't want Councilman Boltzmann's name to come up in a case like this.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:34,540
uh inspector are you threatening me no of course not i simply want to know the truth of the matter

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,280
that's all

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:27,540
We'll be right back.

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:57,540
We'll see you next time.

15
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:07,620
I know he works for a hotshot politician, but man, that guy's not going to give an inch.

16
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,120
No, he'll come around.

17
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,900
Boltzmann's got a pretty good thing going here.

18
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,420
Why risk it all on some random prostitute?

19
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,180
The victim was no ordinary prostitute.

20
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,080
The names of countless politicians and businessmen were traced back to her.

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,140
Well, yeah, but there's only one person who claims to have seen them both at the same hotel.

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,900
Just because they stayed at the same hotel doesn't make them a John.

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,560
Have you decoded her client list for me?

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,160
Actually, we're still working on cracking that code. It's a lot tougher than we thought.

25
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,260
I'll do it myself. Just give me the disk.

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,220
Great. But don't you already have a bunch of other cases on your plate?

27
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,140
It doesn't matter. Give it to me.

28
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,760
Um, there's something I've been meaning to ask you for a while.

29
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,980
What is it?

30
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,160
Well, how do you find the time to sleep?

31
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,480
What does that have to do with the case?

32
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,480
Huh?

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,080
It's an irrelevant question, Detective.

34
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,700
Well, have you gotten the chance to talk to him?

35
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,940
It doesn't really matter when we tell him.

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,560
He doesn't listen. He stopped listening to me a long time ago.

37
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,300
I know. But the sooner you tell him, the better.

38
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,240
Keep it down. You're being too loud.

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,860
He's here, you know, working in his office.

40
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
Yeah? I wonder why.

41
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,500
Damn it!

42
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,400
Are you still trying to connect Councilman Boltzmann to the murder of that prostitute, Lungay?

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,340
Is there a problem with that, Chief?

44
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,240
Yes, there's a problem with that.

45
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,640
I'm getting all sorts of grief from the Ministry of the Interior.

46
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,120
You're just going to have to smooth things out like you usually do.

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,020
No! I can't unburn any more bridges for you. It's too big.

48
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,600
Do whatever you can, Chief.

49
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,760
Give me a break here, Lungay.

50
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,920
You're good, but you're only human. Sometimes you're gonna be wrong.

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,500
Are you gonna risk your entire career on a dead hooker?

52
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,560
Come on, do you need another feather in your cap?

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,940
Oh, God. Don't tell me you're doing this for the principle of the thing.

54
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:23,580
fame justice I'm not interested in either all I know is a woman was

55
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,580
murdered in cold blood I'm just interested in finding the killer nothing

56
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:44,440
else matters to me long day excuse me inspector you have a visitor got it huh I

57
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,420
I managed to figure out the encryption that she was using.

58
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,360
Use this formula to get all the names on her client list.

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,840
Oh. Um, that woman is here again, sir.

60
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,580
You know the one, Ava Heinemann?

61
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,760
Hey, you can't just come back here. We've been over this before.

62
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,720
When will Tenma be arrested? You have all you need.

63
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,360
It seems like you've been drinking quite a bit this morning.

64
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, of course I've been drinking.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,520
Just so you know, I've already figured out the case regarding Dr. Tenma.

66
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,120
Huh?

67
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,860
He insists that everything is the work of a man called Johan.

68
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,280
But this Johan is just another personality within Tenma's mind.

69
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,540
If you think about it, with this hypothesis, what seemed illogical now makes sense.

70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,760
All we have to do at this point is just wait for the police to capture him.

71
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,660
So that means it's not your problem once you've got an arrest warrant. Is that what you're saying?

72
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,400
There are a lot of things I would like to ask him when we finally meet.

73
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,640
Dr. Tenma. What an interesting individual he is.

74
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,180
However, I have so many other cases piling up on my desk as we speak.

75
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,180
If you'll excuse me.

76
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,760
Don't you people ever let up?

77
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,700
I told you, Councilman Boltzmann has an alibi for that night.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,080
An alibi? Of course he did.

79
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,980
The murder was a professional.

80
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,120
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,540
Are you honestly suggesting that my employer hired a hitman to kill that girl?

82
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,620
Ridiculous.

83
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,660
I've cracked the code on the list of clients of the woman who was killed.

84
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,640
Councilman Boltzmann's name was on that list.

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,900
You know, even if that were the case,

86
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,360
it still doesn't prove that he had her killed.

87
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,740
Right. Come to think of it, that's as far as we've gotten.

88
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,380
I'm sure you'll be in touch. Now leave.

89
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,100
We're dead in the water without a smoking gun, wouldn't you say?

90
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,000
Are you familiar with a publishing house called Shellhorn?

91
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:52,820
They're not a major company, but they stay in business by publishing tell-all books on famous people, like politicians.

92
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,460
They're known to play very dirty.

93
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:02,720
They hire unscrupulous women to build relationships with famous men in order to create scandals to write about.

94
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,580
If I were you, I'd watch out for people like that.

95
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:30,880
Check and mate. You should have seen it.

96
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,800
It was great. Boltzmann's guy just stared at him like,

97
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,140
What? Lungay is unbelievable.

98
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,540
Near as I can tell, all he does is work.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,660
He's a robot, I'm telling you.

100
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Man, I hear you.

101
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,040
The guy barely seems human to me.

102
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,140
Huh?

103
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,880
Oh, right.

104
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,820
Speaking of checkmate, there it is.

105
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,920
What the hell?

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,500
Hey, don't butt into our game, buddy.

107
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,280
You shouldn't waste your time with mind-numbing games.

108
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,600
It seems after a simple little threat,

109
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,580
the president of the publishing company chose to confess.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,740
Write a report.

111
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,400
Right away.

112
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,840
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:15,460
here what do you think you're looking at it's that call girl's notebook it records the date

114
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,880
and time and other details of encounters with a certain client i can't really tell you the man's

115
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,400
name he's only referred to here by the initial b not to mention shellhorn publishing also made

116
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,840
arrangements with the woman to release her autobiography interesting don't you think

117
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,920
Oh, by the way, have you ever been in contact with a man named Yanker?

118
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,280
You may be aware that he is a professional hitman.

119
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,680
I want you to leave.

120
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,680
You get the hell out of here now!

121
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,320
We're moving out, both of us, right now.

122
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:09,420
level with me you never even noticed i was pregnant not even now did you are you going

123
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,680
to the man who fathered your child what do you care i bet you didn't even notice that

124
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,120
i was having an affair with another man did you

125
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:29,640
yes inspector it's me mintok baltimore secretary look i'll tell you everything

126
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,100
but you need to get over here right now please

127
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Understood.

128
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,100
I have to go. We can talk about this later.

129
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Inspector!

130
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
What just happened here?

131
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,100
The secretary! He committed suicide!

132
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:31,280
Councilman Boltzmann's an innocent man.

133
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,280
Not much of a suicide note, but that's all we got.

134
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,740
Lungay, I'm handing this one over to Inspector Kaminsky.

135
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,180
I'm giving him the Reichner Park and Gallen murder cases, too.

136
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,700
Given what happened, I think it's for the best.

137
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,820
So then, what am I supposed to do now?

138
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,920
Get your head together.

139
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,280
Then we'll talk about work.

140
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:28,740
Well, Dr. Tenma, it seems there's nothing left to distract me.

141
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:40,660
Uh, sorry, Inspector. You have a visitor? It's Eva Heinemann. I could tell her to come

142
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,040
back another day if, you know...

143
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,280
No, show her in.

144
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:13,600
I had a great time Eva how long until next time not sure babe maybe when I

145
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,900
return for my next business trip oh I don't want to give you back to your wife

146
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:24,460
come on stay all right I'll give you a call

147
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,760
No, you won't be coming back.

148
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,680
Not after getting in trouble for that perfumed handkerchief that I carefully placed in your suitcase.

149
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,860
You stupid bastard.

150
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,560
You were eavesdropping again, weren't you?

151
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,440
You must see all the different men I'm with, isn't that right?

152
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,240
Uh, no.

153
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,980
Well, what then? You want to join in the fun, is that it?

154
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,500
No, of course not.

155
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,600
You pervert.

156
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,000
You're wrong. I mean, I just...

157
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,640
I forget how nice it is.

158
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,600
It's beautiful. I really love this garden.

159
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Looking at all this greenery helps me forget about the distasteful things out there.

160
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,200
Well, I'm so glad that you like it.

161
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,460
I'm going to plant some mimosas here.

162
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,640
And over there, I'm planning to put up an arch for your roses.

163
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,280
When summer gets here, it's going to be beautiful.

164
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,940
I'm wondering if maybe someone like you could be up to the task.

165
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:34,260
so what do you think do you think you can make me happy dad hey dad are you

166
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:41,440
listening to me dad huh oh how is my cooking today am I getting any better

167
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,060
you haven't heard a single word I said have you dad how come you're always

168
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:53,500
daydreaming I bet you that's why mom ran off with another man oh I'm sorry it's

169
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,880
- It's fine, really.

170
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,260
Actually, Coletta?

171
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,280
- Yeah?

172
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,280
- If Daddy found someone he really liked.

173
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,380
- Huh?

174
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,820
- Um, no, forget it, it's nothing.

175
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,720
My cooking is pretty awful, right?

176
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,140
Come on, tell the truth.

177
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,540
- It's not so bad.

178
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,020
- I see, not bad, huh?

179
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,020
Sorry for the trouble. You're a gardener, but I'm asking you to do all these odd jobs.

180
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,020
No problem.

181
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,020
My handyman kept asking for time off and then quit.

182
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,020
I'll do everything I can to help.

183
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,020
So, how about dinner tonight?

184
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,020
Oh, well, okay.

185
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,920
Why are you nervous?

186
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,560
Well, I'm not used to expensive restaurants like this.

187
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,220
If you want to be a man worthy of my company, you must be confident wherever you go.

188
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,040
Just pretend you're working in my garden right now.

189
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,780
Um, yes, that's right.

190
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,640
I do feel pretty confident when I'm out there working on something new in the yard.

191
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,080
I feel so satisfied when a garden turns out the way I envisioned it.

192
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,260
I just love being out there, you know?

193
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,120
People who like gardens can't be all that bad.

194
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,860
And you did say you liked that garden the other day.

195
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,680
Are you trying to say that I'm a good person?

196
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,100
Yeah, of course.

197
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,400
But you...

198
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,520
Well, go on.

199
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,960
You seem, you know, kind of lonely.

200
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,900
I'm not the only one.

201
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,180
I'm guessing that you're lonely, too.

202
00:15:50,260 --> 00:16:10,640
Um, I'm sorry.

203
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,220
My daughter's probably worried about me, so I should get going.

204
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,660
Mm, Kenzo.

205
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,320
Kenzo.

206
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:34,480
It's almost Christmas, Coletta.

207
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,800
You should tell Santa he doesn't have to come this year.

208
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,540
Hey, come on, sweetie. Don't say things like that.

209
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,820
Dad, celebrating Christmas just the two of us sounds lonely.

210
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,540
Let's not do anything, okay?

211
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,360
Yeah, well, it might not just be the two of us

212
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Celebrating this year, you know

213
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,240
The man you're looking at in those photographs ruined my life

214
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,000
Sorry, I was just cleaning up. His name is Kenzo tenma. He's my ex-fiancee

215
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,720
You're drinking again at this time of day. Well, of course I've been drinking

216
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,520
I just went to see Inspector Lungay of the BKA.

217
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Can you believe that useless, incompetent inspector sent me away?

218
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,140
All I want to know is when they're going to arrest Tenma.

219
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
The BKA? Arrest?

220
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,060
He killed my father and then ran away!

221
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,820
Oh, he says he's innocent, but he's not fooling anybody.

222
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,500
My future should have been gilded in gold as the daughter of the director of a large hospital.

223
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,780
My three divorces? Everything is his fault.

224
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:53,000
And he blames the murders on Johan this is Johan with my father. Do you think that this child could kill anyone?

225
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,900
Is that really what tenma told you? It's utter nonsense

226
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:04,100
Have you ever shown this photograph to the police? Of course not. Why would I well, I don't know

227
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:11,060
It could be important evidence. Maybe tenma's the one who did it like Lungay says he has a split personality damn it

228
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:18,420
Then tell me, why do you still keep framed pictures of him like this around the house years later?

229
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,440
I figure deep down, you think Tenma is innocent.

230
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,000
You still have feelings for him.

231
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,460
You watch too many soap operas.

232
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,720
Out of all the men I've ever met, Kenzo satisfied the most of my requirements.

233
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,400
His position suited me.

234
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,520
He was an elite neurosurgeon who many considered a genius.

235
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,460
Besides, he spoiled me.

236
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,580
And best of all, he never contradicted me.

237
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,900
He just listened to my every single request.

238
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,780
Yes, yes, yes!

239
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,100
He was the man who always said yes to me!

240
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,900
That man could have made me the happiest person in the world!

241
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,380
Do you understand what I'm saying?

242
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,280
Do you think I would ever be able to fill his shoes?

243
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,360
I'd be willing to tend your gardens for the rest of my life.

244
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
If that would help to ease your pain, Annie.

245
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,440
Don't flatter yourself just because I slept with you once.

246
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,340
You were just something to pass the time.

247
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,780
I was bored, that's all.

248
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,880
I was playing with you, and you fell for it.

249
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,920
You fool.

250
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,620
Who do you think you are?

251
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:43,080
Ava, you are truly a sad and lonely person

252
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,020
So are you

253
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:52,960
On Christmas Day, I'm having a party at my house with my daughter

254
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,740
You're welcome to join us

255
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:07,220
Wow, Dad, everything looks delicious.

256
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,380
Did you really make this all by yourself?

257
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,340
Yep, but I can't guarantee it'll be good.

258
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,840
But isn't this way too much for the two of us?

259
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,540
Do you think so?

260
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,060
Hmm?

261
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,420
Mom's coming home for Christmas, huh?

262
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,500
I'm right, aren't I?

263
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,700
-Well, aren't I, Dad? -Coletta.

264
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,120
It's Mom! She's home!

265
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,140
Char... Charlotta.

266
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Mommy!

267
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm so sorry, dear. I'm sorry.

Welcome back.

278
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,740
So, Inspector Lungay, you finally decided to listen to me.

279
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,560
I had some time open up, that's all.

280
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,400
This man was my only hope.

281
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,400
I must see to it that his life is ruined.

282
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Or I can never be happy again.
