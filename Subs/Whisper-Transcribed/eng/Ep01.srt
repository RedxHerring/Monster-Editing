1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,800
Outstanding.

3
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,500
Yes, his skills are truly unmatched.

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,120
The aneurysm was in such a delicate location, yet he clipped it off so effortlessly.

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,960
Indeed. Another perfect operation by the peerless Dr. Tenma.

6
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,280
I was finally able to observe the genius surgeon at work for myself.

7
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,460
No, I couldn't have done it without your help. Thank you all very much.

8
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,760
It's not midday already, is it?

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,540
Well, you know that surgery did go on for almost six straight hours

10
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,440
We don't have any more patients today

11
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,760
You should go rest

12
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:38,500
Mommy, where's Daddy?

13
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,500
What happened to Daddy?

14
00:01:40,500 --> 00:02:10,480
Oh, my God.

15
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:40,480
We'll be right back.

16
00:02:40,500 --> 00:03:10,480
We'll be right back.

17
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:40,480
To be continued...

18
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:53,140
Wake up, sleepyhead.

19
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,680
It's time to wake up, Dr. Tenma.

20
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,160
Looks like roles have been reversed.

21
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,160
It should be a princess like me who's awoken with a gentle kiss.

22
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,400
Ava, when did you get here?

23
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,700
his family to the west well i guess you did forget about our date didn't you kenzo i'm here in

24
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,980
düsseldorf where the east german trade i didn't forget fled to the west appeared before the press

25
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:28,740
yesterday along with his family mr and mrs liebert appeared to be in fine spirits along with their

26
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,620
fraternal twins the family will remain in düsseldorf for an unknown period of time before

27
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,140
moving to a home provided by local government authorities we'll be following this story with

28
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:51,380
great interest i feel like i'm still so exhausted hey wake up look at the tv they're talking about

29
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:58,660
you but seems to be recovering well after undergoing surgery dr heinemann director of

30
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,380
eisler memorial hospital where the surgery was performed is holding a press conference now we

31
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,620
take you there live. Mr. Rosenbach's diagnosis showed a ruptured aneurysm in his cranial artery.

32
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,640
The operation went smoothly, including the successful clipping of the patient's cerebral

33
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,200
hemorrhage. Mr. Rosenbach has quite a large following. What are his chances of a full

34
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,880
recovery? Yes, well, we will certainly do whatever is necessary for him to be able to sing again.

35
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,220
Dr. Heinemann's surgical team has completed many difficult surgeries, including Mr. Rosenbach's.

36
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,540
however with this latest success they have affirmed our country's status in

37
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:42,440
the medical world isn't that wonderful Kenzo it wasn't even about me it was all

38
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,340
about your father well that may be true but it's only because you did such a

39
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,260
wonderful job last night working as part of father's team I'm sure he appreciates

40
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,880
all your hard work since you're the one responsible for raising the hospital's

41
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,140
reputation. No, I'm the one who should be grateful. I mean, after all, it is thanks to your father that

42
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm actually able to work here in Germany. Hang in there, Kenzo. If you stick with father, your

43
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,800
future is guaranteed. It won't be long before father becomes chairman of the board. Soon after

44
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,700
that, you'll become chief of surgery, and then chief director. Which means I'll be the director's

45
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,860
wife you better make me happy kenzo because hardship doesn't suit me

46
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,180
you still want to go out on that date or should we just

47
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,500
blood pressure 128 over 64. spatula

48
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,380
i will now scrape the pyramus

49
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,160
Whoa.

50
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,880
As usual, you did a magnificent job, Dr. Tenlo.

51
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,740
Thank you very much.

52
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,200
But it seems to me that your talents extend beyond the OR.

53
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,700
Well, you're the head of neurosurgery at such a young age.

54
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,040
You've become the golden boy for both the director and the chief of surgery.

55
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,720
And on top of that, you've even captured the heart of the director's daughter.

56
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,180
What exactly are you trying to say, doctor?

57
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,660
Ah, sorry. I'm not suggesting you've done anything wrong here.

58
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,160
After all, hospitals are ruled by politics.

59
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,200
Come on, you do realize that you're being used by the director now, don't you, Dr. Tenma?

60
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,800
I mean, take that amazing surgery you performed on that opera singer.

61
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,740
He acted like he performed it himself, even holding a televised press conference.

62
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,720
Well, if he is using you, then it must mean that you are gifted.

63
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,360
When you do become successful, don't forget about good old Becker.

64
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
I'll buy you a drink next time, eh, Tenma?

65
00:07:51,700 --> 00:08:19,920
may I help you are you dr. tenma I am give me back my husband

66
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Huh?

67
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Give me back my husband!

68
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Tell me, just tell me, why didn't you operate on my husband?

69
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Who are you?

70
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,920
My husband was dying and he was brought to this emergency room first!

71
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,920
He came in long before that stupid opera singer was here!

72
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
But you made him wait to be operated on!

73
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Everyone says you're supposed to be the best surgeon in this entire hospital!

74
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Why? Why? Why?

75
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
I remember now.

76
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,920
I was about to start surgery on a Turkish man injured in a construction accident.

77
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Dr. Tenma!

78
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Yes, sir?

79
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,920
You shouldn't be here right now, Doctor. Get over to OR-1 immediately.

80
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,920
These are the Director's orders, Doctor, so please hurry.

81
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Why? If you had operated on him, he would have survived!

82
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
What? What?

83
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Bring him back to me!

84
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Bring him back!

85
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,920
And then my friend and I started fighting over that dress.

86
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
It was the only one they had in that size.

87
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Can you believe that?

88
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
But don't worry about it.

89
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Of course, it was mine in the end.

90
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Hey, are you listening?

91
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Huh?

92
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Yeah.

93
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Is there something wrong?

94
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
You seem distracted.

95
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,620
I checked the records and the surgeon who operated on the Turkish man was dr.

96
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,360
Becker why are you still talking about that if you look back over the charts

97
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,480
they clearly show what happened Becker took too long to treat that man

98
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,020
I don't know but I think if I had performed the surgery on him I might

99
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,180
have been able to save his life do we have to talk about this at dinner but

100
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,600
what does she want from me anyway I was just following orders from the director

101
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,100
when I perform surgery on that opera singer.

102
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,220
I'm not responsible.

103
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,060
Well, am I?

104
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,600
- Well, of course not.

105
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,700
After all, people's lives aren't created equal.

106
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Bring him back! Give me back my husband! Bring him back!

107
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Is that the house?

108
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Yes. One of the neighbors called in.

109
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
How many shots were fired?

110
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Five or six, sir.

111
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Who lives in this house?

112
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,400
well it seems it seems to be the residents of the Liebert family who

113
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:22,600
recently fled here from East Germany this is gonna turn into a big mess

114
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:33,540
we'll charge in there at the count of three one two three

115
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:56,400
This is bad.

116
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,000
What happened here?

117
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,360
Someone's there!

118
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:23,120
There appears to be one survivor. A girl. A man and a woman are dead.

119
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,220
A boy is in critical condition. I repeat, one boy is in critical condition.

120
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:40,520
An emergency.

121
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,240
A bullet to the head. Is that boy the only patient?

122
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,740
Yes. His parents were DOA. It seems to have been a robbery.

123
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,160
All right, then. I'm about five minutes out.

124
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,320
I should be there shortly.

125
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,280
Oh, Father.

126
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,020
Evening, Dr. Heinemann.

127
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,520
I'm terribly sorry for keeping your precious daughter out so late.

128
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,860
What are you talking about, Tenma?

129
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,720
It's all right. Ava is your fiancée, isn't she?

130
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,300
Now, what are we all doing standing here?

131
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,500
Come in, have some tea.

132
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:31,420
so tell me something have you notified your parents in japan about your wedding date yet

133
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,480
uh yes sir but my father runs a small hospital back home so i'm not sure if he'll be able to

134
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,780
take the time and come all the way out here to germany well wouldn't it be a good opportunity

135
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,080
for him to take some time off and enjoy a leisure trip overseas yes they should come we're taking

136
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,040
care of the expenses anyway thank you very much sir i'm completely indebted to you for everything

137
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,600
you've done for me did i ever tell you that when you first arrived here in germany i thought you

138
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,400
were a high school student and now you're the best young doctor at eisler memorial hospital

139
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,280
by the way kenzo i want to talk to you about your current research on cerebrovascular spasms

140
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,240
and subarachnoid hemorrhages oh good i've been creating a model of a subarachnoid hemorrhage

141
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,800
in a dog i'm sorry but i'm going to have to cancel the project but sir i have been asked

142
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,760
to speak at the next european medical convention and of course that means preparing a sharp

143
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:35,360
presentation that's why i want to have you compile my manuscript well sir my research is very close

144
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,640
to being completed i'm almost finished by the way ava did i tell you what happened earlier today

145
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,600
no father you didn't what happened a suspicious group of civilians forced their way into the

146
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,440
hospital they were protesting the operation we performed on the opera singer they claimed we

147
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,260
pushed back the case of a Turkish man who'd arrived at the ER first they got

148
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,460
the whole thing wrong that's not how it happened that Turkish man was operated

149
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:12,700
on first there was not a thing wrong with our procedures right Tenma yes

150
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,120
apparently they think we're some kind of charity or something our priority is to

151
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,940
to progress as medical scholars before we save lives.

152
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,960
Don't you agree?

153
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,520
In any case, I do want you to work on my manuscript.

154
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,800
I have great expectations of you, Dr. Tenma.

155
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,500
- I appreciate that, sir.

156
00:15:48,120 --> 00:16:08,840
Where's the patient?

157
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,080
They just brought him in.

158
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,260
How's he holding up?

159
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,300
Blood pressure 72 over 50.

160
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:22,200
his pulse is at 137 the bullet entered through his forehead we need x-rays

161
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:30,520
immediately yes doctor Oh dr. tenma

162
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,700
who's this she's the twin sister of the little boy we just brought in any

163
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,320
injuries no but she seems to have sustained a serious psychological shock

164
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Yes, what is it?

165
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,780
Dr.. Tenma

166
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,960
The boys x-rays and CT scans are ready. I understand. I'll be there shortly

167
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,320
It entered the front of the head and stopped deep in the center of the brain

168
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,960
Yes

169
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:18,300
This one is definitely going to be difficult, huh? The bullet is touching the left side of the middle cerebral artery here

170
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
Will you look at that?

171
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,180
Dr. Tenma is absolutely right. This one won't be easy

172
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,020
If you jostle the bullet even the slightest bit then the artery could rupture and cause a massive hemorrhage

173
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,980
Hey, I'm late

174
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,740
Dr. Becker you're supposed to be on duty. I don't understand how you could be so late

175
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,740
We'll do a full frontal craniotomy and remove the bone fragments and contaminated brain matter.

176
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,740
Then we'll remove the bullet very carefully, and lastly repair the arterial wall.

177
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,740
But with a little hard work and some luck, I'm certain that we can pull it off.

178
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,740
Blood pressure 120/80, pulse 92. He's looking good.

179
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,740
The anesthesia's taking effect.

180
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:20,200
oh there you are doctor yes you shouldn't be here you're needed in operating room one

181
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,300
immediately it's critically urgent mayor roediger has suffered a cerebral blood clot

182
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:32,780
he's being transported here by helicopter they're scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes

183
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,540
then i think the best thing is to contact dr boyer there's a chance his carotid artery is blocked

184
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,440
If that's the case, we want you to operate on him.

185
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,780
But, sir, I can't do that. I was just about to begin surgery on that young boy.

186
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,460
Here.

187
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,600
It's an order from the director.

188
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,340
Hello, this is Tenma.

189
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,940
Hello, Tenma. Take care of the mayor, will you?

190
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,800
I've contacted Dr. Eisen and Dr. Boyer.

191
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,480
It'll be good to have that extra support in case you need it, but dr. Heinemann. I was about to start another operation right now

192
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,900
I forget it. Just let dr. Becker take over that one

193
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,260
With all due respect sir

194
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,360
The patient I am about to operate on has a bullet up against his left middle cerebral artery

195
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,660
And it could turn into a very complex surgery, but I am confident I can save him director

196
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,400
So I'm going to let dr. Boyer take care of the mayor

197
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,660
I'm the only one who can perform this surgery on that boy

198
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,580
Tenma I'm expecting you to do everything in your power to save the mayor

199
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,860
You need to understand something very important in the next review of medical facilities

200
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:54,400
The mayor has promised our hospital a very generous increase in funds. We can't have him die just yet

201
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:01,160
Do you understand I'm expecting you will do this. I'm counting on you. Dr. Tenma

202
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Yes, sir

203
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,600
The mayor has just arrived on the heliport doctor

204
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,600
After the CT scans are done do the angiogram. We need to confirm where the arteries blocked

205
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,080
About time to get ready dr. Tenma. Yeah, we're all counting on those brilliant skills of yours

206
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Apparently, they think we're some kind of charity or something.

207
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Our priority is to progress as medical scholars before we save lives.

208
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Tenma, don't you agree?

209
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
But what does she want from me anyway?

210
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,400
I was just following orders from the director when I performed surgery on that opera singer.

211
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
I'm not responsible.

212
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Well, am I?

213
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,400
After all, people's lives aren't created equal.

214
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:07,280
bring him back if you had operated on him you would have survived

215
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,620
why bring him back to me bring him back bring him back

216
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:21,280
hmm well is something the matter dr tenma

217
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,320
I have...

218
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,980
I have a surgery to perform in the other room.

219
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,100
Hey, where are you going, Dr. Tenma?

220
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,480
But this is an order from the director.

221
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,120
The mayor is having a CT scan done on him now.

222
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,380
Doctors, please report to the reading room.

223
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,540
On my way.

224
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,120
Dr. Tenma!

225
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,920
Dr. Tenma!

226
00:21:51,280 --> 00:22:00,000
Hang in there, kid.

227
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,760
I'll save you, no matter what.

228
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
G-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g
