1
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,040
(eerie music)

2
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,180
(eerie music)

3
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:37,800
- Outstanding.

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,520
- Yes, his skills are truly unmatched.

5
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,980
- The aneurysm was in such a delicate location,

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,100
yet he clipped it off so effortlessly.

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,380
- Indeed, another perfect operation

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,960
by the peerless Dr. Tenma.

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,120
- I was finally able to observe the genius surgeon

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,260
at work for myself.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,640
- No, I couldn't have done it without your help.

12
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,460
Thank you all very much.

13
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,800
It's not midday already, is it?

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,440
Well, you know that surgery did go on for almost six straight hours.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,740
We don't have any more patients today. You should go rest.

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,280
(crying)

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,480
Mommy, where's Daddy?

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,520
What happened to Daddy?

19
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,320
(crying)

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,880
(sobbing)

21
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,220
(choral music)

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,980
(rock music)

23
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,100
(upbeat music)

24
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,760
Ken, it's time to wake up, Dr. Tenma.

25
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,980
Looks like roles have been reversed.

26
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,540
It should be a princess like me

27
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,140
who's awoken with a gentle kiss.

28
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,420
- Eva, when'd you get here?

29
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,200
- I guess you did forget about our date,

30
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,300
didn't you, Kenzo?

31
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,400
- I'm here in Dusseldorf,

32
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,520
where the East German Trade Commissioner fled to the West,

33
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,580
appeared before the press yesterday,

34
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,600
"Mr. and Mrs. Liebert appeared to be in fine spirits along with their fraternal twins.

35
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,360
The family will remain in Dusseldorf for an unknown period of time before moving to a

36
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,640
home provided by local government authorities.

37
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,160
We'll be following this story with great interest."

38
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,780
I feel like I'm still so exhausted.

39
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,560
Hey, wake up!

40
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,820
Look at the TV!

41
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,720
They're talking about you!

42
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,820
recovering well after undergoing surgery.

43
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,980
Dr. Heinemann, director of Eisler Memorial Hospital,

44
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,360
where the surgery was performed,

45
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,080
is holding a press conference now.

46
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,360
We take you there live.

47
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,540
Mr. Rosenbach's diagnosis showed a ruptured aneurysm

48
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,640
in his cranial artery.

49
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,380
The operation went smoothly,

50
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,840
including the successful clipping

51
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,360
of the patient's cerebral hemorrhage.

52
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,860
Mr. Rosenbach has quite a large following.

53
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,640
What are his chances of a full recovery?

54
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,780
Yes, well, we will certainly do whatever is necessary for him to be able to sing again.

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,200
Dr. Heinemann's surgical team has completed many difficult surgeries, including Mr. Rosenbach's.

56
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,480
However, with this latest success, they have affirmed our country's status in the medical world.

57
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,500
Isn't that wonderful, Kenzo?

58
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,380
It wasn't even about me. It was all about your father.

59
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,400
Well, that may be true, but it's only because you did such a wonderful job last night working as part of father's team

60
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,520
I'm sure he appreciates all your hard work since you're the one responsible for raising the hospital's reputation

61
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,080
No, I'm the one who should be grateful. I mean after all it is

62
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Thanks to your father that I'm actually able to work here in Germany

63
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,640
Hang in there Kenzo if you stick with father your future is guaranteed

64
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,720
It won't be long before father becomes chairman of the board.

65
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,660
Soon after that, you'll become chief of surgery.

66
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,480
And then chief director.

67
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,140
Which means I'll be the director's wife.

68
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,940
You better make me happy, Kenzo, 'cause hardship doesn't suit me.

69
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,900
You still wanna go out on that date?

70
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,640
Or should we just...

71
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:47,540
Blood pressure 128 over 64. Spatula. I will now scrape the Pyramus.

72
00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:01,020
Whoa. As usual you did a magnificent job Dr. Tenma. Thank you very much. But it

73
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,940
seems to me that your talents extend beyond the OR. Well you're the head of

74
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,700
Neurosurgery at such a young age.

75
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,940
You've become the golden boy for both the director

76
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,040
and the chief of surgery.

77
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,420
And on top of that,

78
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,720
you've even captured the heart of the director's daughter.

79
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,180
- What exactly are you trying to say, doctor?

80
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,000
- Ah, sorry.

81
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,640
I'm not suggesting you've done anything wrong here.

82
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,140
After all, hospitals are ruled by politics.

83
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,300
Come on, you do realize that you're being used

84
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,220
by the director now, don't you, Dr. Tenma?

85
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,320
I mean, take that amazing surgery

86
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,800
you performed on that opera singer.

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,960
He acted like he performed it himself.

88
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,800
a televised press conference.

89
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,280
Well, if he is using you,

90
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,740
then it must mean that you are gifted.

91
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,660
When you do become successful,

92
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,380
don't forget about good old Becker.

93
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,660
I'll buy you a drink next time, eh, Tenma?

94
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,460
(footsteps)

95
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,460
- Uh, may I help you?

96
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,080
- Are you Dr. Tenma?

97
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,220
- I am.

98
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,780
- Give me back my husband.

99
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,060
- Huh?

100
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,860
- Give me back my husband!

101
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,120
Tell me, just tell me,

102
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,020
why didn't you operate on my husband?

103
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,400
- Who are you?

104
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,740
- My husband was dying

105
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,960
and he was brought to this emergency room first.

106
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,520
long before that stupid opera singer was here!

107
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,100
But you made him wait till he operated on!

108
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,060
[scoffs]

109
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,040
Everyone says you're supposed to be the best surgeon

110
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,340
in this entire hospital!

111
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,800
Why?

112
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,000
Why?

113
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,240
Why?

114
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,260
I remember now.

115
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,060
I was about to start surgery on a Turkish man

116
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,600
injured in a construction accident.

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,220
- Dr. Tenma. - Yes, sir?

118
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,440
You shouldn't be here right now, doctor.

119
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,080
Immediately. These are the director's orders, Doctor, so please hurry.

120
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,200
Why? If you had operated on him, he would have survived!

121
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,160
Why? Bring him back to me! Bring him back!

122
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,940
And then my friend and I started fighting over that dress.

123
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,920
It was the only one they had in that size. Can you believe that?

124
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,020
But don't worry about it. Of course, it was mine in the end.

125
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,320
Hey, are you listening?

126
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:38,820
Huh?

127
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,620
Yeah.

128
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,000
Is there something wrong? You seem distracted.

129
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,980
I checked the records, and the surgeon who operated on the Turkish man was Dr. Becker.

130
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,440
Why are you still talking about that?

131
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,800
If you look back over the charts, they clearly show what happened.

132
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,580
Becker took too long to treat that man.

133
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,680
I don't know, but I think if I had performed the surgery on him,

134
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,380
I might have been able to save his life.

135
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,980
But what does she want from me anyway?

136
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,500
I was just following orders from the director

137
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,640
when I performed surgery on that opera singer.

138
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,140
I'm not responsible.

139
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,920
Well, am I?

140
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,340
Well, of course not.

141
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,380
After all, people's lives aren't created equal.

142
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,020
(eerie music)

143
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,480
- Bring him back!

144
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,520
Give me back my husband!

145
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,480
Bring him back!

146
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,480
(suspenseful music)

147
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,640
(tires screeching)

148
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,600
- Is that the house?

149
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,760
- Yes, one of the neighbors called in.

150
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,720
How many shots were fired?

151
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,180
Five or six, sir.

152
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Who lives in this house?

153
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,740
Well, it seems...

154
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,240
It seems to be the residents of the Liebert family who recently fled here from East Germany.

155
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,820
This is gonna turn into a big mess.

156
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,980
We'll charge in there at the count of three.

157
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,960
One...

158
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,320
Two...

159
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,660
Three!

160
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,360
(grunts)

161
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,400
- This is bad.

162
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,980
What happened here?

163
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,700
(yells)

164
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,340
- Someone's there!

165
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,600
There appears to be one survivor, a girl, a man and a woman are dead, a boy is in critical

166
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,120
condition.

167
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,380
I repeat, one boy is in critical condition.

168
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,340
An emergency...

169
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,300
A bullet to the head...

170
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,240
Is that boy the only patient?

171
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,440
Yes. His parents were DOA.

172
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,380
All right, then. I'm about five minutes out. I should be there shortly.

173
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,260
Oh, Father!

174
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,520
Evening, Dr. Heineman. I'm terribly sorry for keeping your precious daughter out so late.

175
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,720
What are you talking about, Tenma? It's all right, Eva is your fiancée, isn't she?

176
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,480
Now, what are we all doing standing here? Come in, have some tea.

177
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,400
So, tell me something. Have you notified your parents in Japan about your wedding date yet?

178
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,860
Uh, yes, sir. But my father runs a small hospital back home,

179
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,700
so I'm not sure if he'll be able to take the time and come all the way out here to Germany.

180
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,880
Well, wouldn't it be a good opportunity for him to take some time off and enjoy a leisure trip overseas?

181
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,440
Yes, they should come. We're taking care of the expenses anyway.

182
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,840
Thank you very much, sir. I'm completely indebted to you for everything you've done for me.

183
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
you that when you first arrived here in Germany, I thought you were a high school student.

184
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,400
And now you're the best young doctor at Eisler Memorial Hospital.

185
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:11,260
By the way, Kenzo, I want to talk to you about your current research on cerebral vascular spasms

186
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,380
and subarachnoid hemorrhages. Oh good, I've been creating a model of a subarachnoid hemorrhage in

187
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:23,440
a dog. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to cancel the project. But sir... I have been asked to speak

188
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,280
And of course, that means preparing a sharp presentation.

189
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,560
That's why I want to have you compile my manuscript.

190
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,320
- Well, sir, my research is very close to being completed.

191
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,360
I'm almost finished.

192
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,260
- By the way, Ava,

193
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,180
did I tell you what happened earlier today?

194
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,760
- No, father, you didn't.

195
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,360
What happened?

196
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,460
- A suspicious group of civilians

197
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,040
forced their way into the hospital.

198
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,320
They were protesting the operation

199
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,980
we performed on the opera singer.

200
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,380
They claimed we pushed back the case

201
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,920
of a Turkish man who'd arrived at the ER first.

202
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,460
They got the whole thing wrong.

203
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,880
That's not how it happened.

204
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,080
That Turkish man was operated on first.

205
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,020
There was not a thing wrong with our procedures.

206
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,300
Right, Tenma?

207
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,620
Yes, sir.

208
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,340
Apparently, they think we're some kind of charity or something.

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,400
Our priority is to progress as medical scholars before we save lives.

210
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,620
Don't you agree?

211
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,620
In any case, I do want you to work on my manuscript.

212
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,540
I have great expectations of you, Dr. Tenma.

213
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,260
I... I appreciate that, sir.

214
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,880
Where's the patient?

215
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,140
They just brought him in.

216
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,260
How's he holding up?

217
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,300
Blood pressure is 72 over 50.

218
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,400
His pulse is at 137.

219
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,340
The bullet entered through his forehead.

220
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,800
We need x-rays immediately.

221
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Yes, Doctor.

222
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,500
Oh, Dr. Tenma.

223
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,340
Who's this?

224
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,280
She's the twin sister of the little boy we just brought in.

225
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,160
Any injuries?

226
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,500
No, but she seems to have sustained a serious psychological shock.

227
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,820
Yes, what is it?

228
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:50,940
Kill...

229
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,800
(dramatic music)

230
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,660
- Dr. Tenma?

231
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,740
The boy's x-rays and CT scans are ready.

232
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,960
- I understand, I'll be there shortly.

233
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,400
- It entered the front of the head

234
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,460
and stopped deep in the center of the brain.

235
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,560
- Yes.

236
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,180
- This one is definitely going to be difficult.

237
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,200
The bullet is touching the left side

238
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,300
of the middle cerebral artery, here.

239
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,320
- Will you look at that?

240
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,400
Dr. Tenma is absolutely right, this one won't be easy.

241
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,920
If you jostle the bullet even the slightest bit,

242
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,120
then the artery could rupture and cause a massive hemorrhage.

243
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,640
Hey, sorry I'm late.

244
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,920
Dr. Becker, you're supposed to be on duty.

245
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,820
I don't understand how you could be so late.

246
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,720
We'll do a full frontal craniotomy and remove the bone fragments

247
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,320
and contaminated brain matter.

248
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,920
Then we'll remove the bullet very carefully

249
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:54,760
and lastly repair the arterial wall hmm but with a little hard work and some

250
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:02,720
luck I'm certain that we can pull it off blood pressure 120 over 80 pulse 92 he's

251
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,640
looking good the anesthesia is taking effect

252
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,260
Oh, there you are, Doctor.

253
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,040
Yes?

254
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,900
You shouldn't be here.

255
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,880
You're needed in Operating Room One immediately.

256
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,440
It's critically urgent.

257
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,280
Mayor Roedeker has suffered a cerebral blood clot.

258
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,440
He's being transported here by helicopter.

259
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,780
They're scheduled to arrive in ten minutes.

260
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,100
Then I think the best thing is to contact Dr. Boyer.

261
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,420
If that's the case, we want you to operate on him.

262
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,060
But sir, I can't do that.

263
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,780
I was just about to begin surgery on that young boy.

264
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,480
Here.

265
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,600
It's an order from the director.

266
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,360
Hello, this is Tenma.

267
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,940
Hello, Tenma. Take care of the mayor, will you?

268
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,620
I've contacted Dr. Eisen and Dr. Boyd.

269
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,100
It'll be good to have that extra support in case you need it, but dr. Heineman

270
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:17,120
I was about to start another operation right now. I forget it. Just let dr. Becker take over that one

271
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,160
With all due respect sir the patient

272
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:27,720
I am about to operate on has a bullet up against his left middle cerebral artery and it could turn into a very complex surgery

273
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,500
But I am confident I can save him director, so I'm going to let dr. Boyer take care of the mayor

274
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,880
I'm the only one who can perform this surgery on that boy

275
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,760
Tenma, I'm expecting you to do everything in your power to save the mayor

276
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,820
You need to understand something very important in the next review of medical facilities

277
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:54,540
The mayor has promised our hospital a very generous increase in funds. We can't have him die just yet

278
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:01,180
Do you understand? I'm expecting you will do this. I'm counting on you. Dr. Tenma

279
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,740
Yes, sir.

280
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,560
The mayor has just arrived on the heliport, doctor.

281
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,960
After the CT scans are done, do the angiogram.

282
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,740
We need to confirm where the artery is blocked.

283
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,100
About time to get ready, Dr. Tenma.

284
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,160
Yeah, we're all counting on those brilliant skills of yours.

285
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,560
Apparently, they think we're some kind of charity or something.

286
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,520
Our priority is to progress as medical scholars before we save lives.

287
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,200
Tenma, don't you agree?

288
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,820
But what does she want from me anyway?

289
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,400
I was just following orders from the director when I performed surgery on that opera singer.

290
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
I'm not responsible.

291
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,140
Well, am I?

292
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,360
After all, people's lives aren't created equal.

293
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,280
(dramatic music)

294
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,480
- Bring him back!

295
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,280
If you had operated on him he would have survived!

296
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,400
Why?

297
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,560
Bring him back to me!

298
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,100
Bring him back!

299
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,580
Bring him back!

300
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,180
Bring him back!

301
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,240
- Hmm, well, is something the matter Dr. Tenma?

302
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:21,760
Hmm?

303
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:37,140
I have I have a surgery to perform in the other room hey where are you going dr. Tenma

304
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,200
but this is an order from the director the mayor is having a CT scan done on him now

305
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,260

306

Hang in there, kid.

I'll save you, no matter what.
