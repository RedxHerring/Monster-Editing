00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:16,920
June 19th, my first meeting with Franz Bonaparte, RF-17-9.

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,220
He was a very quiet man.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,200
He was graceful, dressed in a suit.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,000
In the afternoon, the children gathered for a book reading.

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,920
- Where are you headed? - To the border.

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,020
- Yeah, which border? - The Czech border, sir.

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,000
- Get in. - Thank you.

8
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,820
In the afternoon, the children gathered for a book reading, a mysterious mansion, a mansion

9
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:13,280
with red roses, P. Brevnov W., a steeple on the left, a weather vane on the right, human

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,340
dignity, experiments, amazing experiments, deprivation of dignity.

11
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,380
So, where are you from? I was just asking what country you're from.

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,880
Oh, I'm from Japan.

13
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,220
I'm not sure you'll like this, but you're welcome to it.

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,180
Here you go. It's left over from my lunch today.

15
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,780
You're very kind, but I'm fine.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,540
Eat. You look like you're about to collapse from hunger any minute now.

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,880
Ha, go on. I sure don't need it. My wife's been nagging me to lose weight.

18
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,800
Thank you. I appreciate it.

19
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,360
To start a long journey, you've got to have something in your stomach or you won't last till the end.

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,880
I have to end it soon. This long journey.

21
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,340
(dramatic music)

22
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,280
What do you mean?

23
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,140
You let him leave?

24
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
You just watched as Tenma walked away?

25
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,580
Yeah.

26
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,140
Why didn't you stop him?

27
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,920
Well, you of all people should know that you can't stop Tenma.

28
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,420
On top of which, with Eva Heinemann missing, our case is in dire straits anyway.

29
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,340
Tenma escaped from jail because he feared for her safety.

30
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:14,580
That lawyer who called himself "Ball" is most likely the same man who tried to murder me in my clinic because I knew too much.

31
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,280
And obviously, his most recent agenda was to get close to me to steal my father's notebook.

32
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,920
Your father's notebook must be extremely important.

33
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,640
Let's go then.

34
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,660
Where?

35
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,340
To where you're thinking Tenma's headed.

36
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,260
The Red Rose Mansion? How can we find it?

37
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,600
It might be easier than we think.

38
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,740
My father's notes were full of odd symbols and cryptic codes, but I don't think that was a code.

39
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,720
The Red Rose Mansion, followed by P. Brevnov W.

40
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,920
I think P is for Prague, and W is for West.

41
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,160
So it's in a Prague suburb to the west of Brevnov.

42
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,640
A place where you can see a weathervane on the right and a steeple on the left.

43
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,900
That's a start.

44
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,800
I just hope there's an eyewitness or something at that mansion that will help us get closer to ending this.

45
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,160
Although, I know that's doubtful.

46
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,260
Children gathered there in the afternoon for a book reading, at least according to father's notes.

47
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,200
Then those children could be our witnesses.

48
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,460
Mr. Verdaman?

49
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,260
Look, I'm sorry I admonished you for letting Tenma just take off like that.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,820
If I had been standing there face to face with him, I'm sure I would have done the exact same thing.

51
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,860
So, let's go.

52
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,740
I was here...

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,160
Once I used to live in this town.

54
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,140

55
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,780
Welcome home!

56
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,680
Are you alright, Nina?

57
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,380
Yes, I'm fine.

58
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:14,560
I think you should stop this Nina you get lost every single time you try it

59
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,220
I'm sure I'll start to remember my brother talked to me back then and told

60
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,480
me what happened how he was taken away from the three frogs what he noted when

61
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,400
he left town and where he went past the train station the town on the left

62
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,500
Beside the river, driving alongside a trolley.

63
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,780
Turn right here, please!

64
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,540
We can't have that.

65
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,940
Keeping secrets from him is definitely a no-no.

66
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,540
You said turn right.

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,980
those were all just pen names used by the same person.

180
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,040
The author's real name is Franz Bonaparta.

181
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,460
Bonaparta? Why do I know?

182
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,660
People can become whatever they want to be.

183
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,720
"Because I wasn't a superior pupil, I was thrown out of the book readings."

184
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,980
"The book readings?"

185
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,100
"Mr. Bonaparte used to be in charge of book readings which were held at the Red Rose Mansion.

186
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,980
I was a student at the mansion then.

187
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,360
It took a while, but I understood what he was trying to do."

188
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,960
"Let's make a deal. Let's make a deal," said the demon.

189
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,120
"No, not at all," said the man with the big eyes.

190
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,220
"Sure, let's make a deal," said the man with the big mouth.

191
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,420
The man with the big mouth grew a beautiful garden.

192
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,280
The man with the big eyes was very hungry because he was very poor.

193
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,860
The man with the big mouth had fun every day.

194
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,980
The man with the big mouth was very full from eating the fruit from his garden.

195
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,220
So he didn't realize what was happening.

196
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,580
He didn't realize that his garden was drying up.

197
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,060
By the time he noticed, it was too late.

198
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,600
The man with the big mouth cried and cried in the garden that never grew again.

199
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,280
"I shouldn't have made a deal with the demon."

200
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,420
Big Eyes was dying from hunger.

201
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,740
Tears were trickling down from his big eyes as he cried,

202
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,400
"I should have made a deal with the demon."

203
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,360
"Let's make a deal, let's make a deal," said the demon.

204
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,380
The Man with the Big Eyes,

205
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,360
The Man with the Big Mouth by Jakub Ferebak.

206
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,800
Every Friday afternoon at three o'clock,

207
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,320
The children would gather together for a book reading.

208
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,780
We would sit around him and listen as he read a book to us

209
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,200
in a kind voice, very calm and gentle.

210
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,760
And when he was finished reading the story,

211
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,860
he would turn and ask us

212
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,200
the meaning of the story.

213
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,360
Do you understand?

214
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,860
I... I understand.

215
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,640
I also understood, after many readings.

216
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,740
He'd say, "Why don't we try reading this next?"

217
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,340
It's as if I've come here for the first time.

218
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,600
Although the journey's taken quite a while,

219
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,500
all the memories have come together.

220
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,960
The God of Peace was very busy.

221
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,240
He was so busy playing the trumpet

222
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,220
he didn't have time to look in the mirror.

223
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,220
The trumpet that the God of Peace played

224
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,900
made everyone very happy.

225
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,680
The God of Peace was so busy,

226
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,060
he didn't have time to look in the mirror.

227
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,680
The mysterious water created green mountains,

228
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,540
ripened the fields, and created flower gardens.

229
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,160
The God of Peace was very busy.

230
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,280
He was so busy naming people,

231
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,240
he didn't have time to look in the mirror.

232
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,680
Your name is Otto.

233
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,320
Your name is Hans.

234
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,960
Your name is Thomas.

235
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,380
Your name is Johann.

236
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,740
Gohan gave the god his hat in appreciation.

237
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,260
The god was very happy.

238
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,520
He put the hat on and looked in the mirror for the first time.

239
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,700
But what he saw was a demon.

240
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,160
The demon inside the mirror said,

241
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,800
"You are me and I am you.

242
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,300
What should I do?

243
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,360
No, no one can live happily with a demon here.

244
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,760
What should I do? What should I do?

245
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,740
Then, the troubled God...

246
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,820
Do you know what the God does?

247
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,200
I know. I figured it out.

248
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,840
Do you know? Do you know what that God did after that?

249
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,100
I know for sure.

250
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:49,260
"We finally meet. I'm back. Welcome home. It's me, Mother. Even you can't tell us apart,

251
00:20:50,120 --> 00:21:00,260
can you? She is me and I am her. You are me and I am you. I understand everything now.

252
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,700
where we came from, and where we're going.

253
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,680
The weather outside is wonderful, Mother.

254
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,040
Everything is about to go up in flames.

255
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,400
(fire crackling)

256
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,860
(footsteps thudding)

257
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,220
(gasps)

258
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,320
- I know what the God does.

259
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,680
He grabs a gun, and points it at his forehead.

260
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,780
(rain falling)

261
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,500
- Shoot me.

262
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,940
(ethereal music)

263
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,520
[MUSIC]

264
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,560
(gentle music)
