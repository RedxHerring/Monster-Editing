1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
Domo, your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,620
Thank you. It's a pleasure doing business with you.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,740
Perhaps the next time we meet, it should be over a round of golf.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,020
What do you say to that, huh?

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,720
All right, but only if you promise to go easy on us.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,480
Of course. I'm looking forward to it.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,640
Oh, domo.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,080
Domo.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:25,960
Domo.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,600
Domo this, domo that.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,880
It's a thoroughly incomprehensible culture.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,860
Ah, domo, domo. Apologies for the wait.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,380
My meeting ran a little longer than expected.

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,900
The name is Iwai of the Kadufuku Corporation, Munich branch.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,260
Inspector Lunge of the BKA.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,080
Pleased to meet you.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,600
Domo.

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,640
Domo Anabao. That was unexpected.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,900
Coffee. Oh, and a refill for him, too.

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,660
My apologies, I know you were expecting to meet with Yamamoto today.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,520
There was an emergency in the Czech Republic, but he's expected back in town sometime tomorrow.

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,420
You seem rather busy.

23
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,900
Oh, yes, I mean, you've heard.

24
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,280
Mr. Schuwald's corporate dynasty?

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,020
Ever since he came out of seclusion and resumed his financial activities,

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,360
all of his affiliate companies and related businesses throughout Germany have been very active.

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,560
The whole Japanese business community is desperately vying for his attention.

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,360
Why is he laughing?

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,220
So, Mr. Yamamoto will not be able to meet with you today.

30
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,980
But I can say that I knew Kenzo Tenma just as well as he did.

31
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,000
So feel free to ask anything.

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,560
But of course.

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,440
I have to say, Inspector, I'm shocked.

34
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,460
He's still under investigation?

35
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,120
Well, I'll just say that we haven't come to any conclusions.

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,360
I was floored to hear Tenma named as a suspect in your investigation.

37
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,300
I couldn't have imagined such a thing.

38
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,480
You just said you felt shocked. Was it really that unexpected?

39
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,180
Absolutely. Kenzo Tenma, a killer?

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,980
Come on. It's just crazy.

41
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,420
Not in a million years would I have pegged Tenma.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,440
as a killer. We had drinks a couple of times. I guess about three years ago. He really didn't

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,900
seem like a bad guy. So he really didn't seem like a bad guy. You're saying you thought he

44
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,640
was a good guy then? A good guy? Let's see. I think reserved would be the word I'd use to

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,020
describe Tenma. What you're saying then is that not being open is what makes him a good man.

46
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, it didn't prevent him from being social. That's what I meant by not a bad guy.

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:23,420
We'll be right back.

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:33,440
♪♪♪

49
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:43,440
♪♪♪

50
00:03:43,440 --> 00:04:13,420
We'll be right back.

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:29,300
Japanese people don't normally wear these sorts of clothes.

52
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,640
Japanese people are skillful with chopsticks.

53
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,840
So now I will be Japanese.

54
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,940
Domo, I'm Japanese.

55
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,720
I am a Japanese man.

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,680
I am a Japanese man. I am Tenma.

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,920
Hello.

58
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,060
Um, Father?

59
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,300
Yes?

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,760
It's me. How are you?

61
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,020
I'm fine.

62
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,320
I called because I heard you were in Munich.

63
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,100
I live here now.

64
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,820
Actually, Father, I'm a mother now.

65
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,180
I had my baby

66
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,620
I thought you'd want to know

67
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,240
I see

68
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,760
That's good

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,840
I know a lot of things have been said between us

70
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,380
But

71
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,460
I want you to see your grandchild

72
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,620
Will you see us?

73
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,200
Of course I will

74
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,860
Well, would tomorrow be okay?

75
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:32,900
Yes

76
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,840
As long as it's after six

77
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,900
Where would you like to meet?

78
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,900
Near Marion Plotz?

79
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,340
Okay

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,520
All right. See you then. Domo.

81
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,640
What?

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,940
Hey, you're pretty good with those chopsticks, you know that?

83
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,440
Is that so?

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,540
Sure. These days I see a lot of foreigners using chopsticks better than native Japanese.

85
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,400
So, Dr. Takahashi, as a former colleague of Tenma's, what would you say was your impression of him?

86
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,620
Let's see.

87
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Well, as I remember, he wasn't a hard guy to like.

88
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,860
Though he was occasionally more than a bit indecisive.

89
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,900
Still.

90
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,260
Go on.

91
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,540
With a scalpel in his hand, he was a whole other person.

92
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,380
People called him a genius brain surgeon.

93
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,200
And I can say that was no exaggeration.

94
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,160
What about his parents?

95
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,220
Hmm.

96
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,100
He never really talked about his parents much.

97
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,560
But he said his father and older brother were doctors also.

98
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,840
So I guess they put him on the physician's path whether he liked it or not.

99
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,960
In fact, I think I remember him saying he hadn't been back to Japan since coming to Germany for medical school.

100
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,940
Matter of fact, his parents didn't come to Germany at all to support him when the scandal broke.

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,560
I don't think they made any public appeal for their son's innocence either.

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,120
I guess he and his family weren't all that tight-knit, you know what I mean?

103
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:26,440
Thanks for waiting. Sorry it's taken so long, but we've just gotten word from Yamamoto.

104
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:33,480
He's left Prague and is back in Munich, but unfortunately he has a client whose needs must be tended to immediately.

105
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,340
He seems to be a busy man.

106
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,420
If it's any consolation, he did say he was going to join all of us at a bar after work.

107
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,020
A bar?

108
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,200
That's right. Care to join us for a drink, Inspector?

109
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,760
The fates have delivered you this opportunity.

110
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,760
After all, it's always good to make a few new contacts.

111
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,700
No. Tonight I have to.

112
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,360
i guess he and his family weren't all that tight-knit you know what i mean

113
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,180
i am tenma

114
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,200
sounds great i would be happy to join you tonight

115
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:54,160
Well done, Iwai! Well done!

116
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,720
Inspector Lungay, how about a song?

117
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,340
Yeah!

118
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,620
Oh, this next song is mine.

119
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,380
Let's sing.

120
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,700
All right.

121
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,660
Let's hear it.

122
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,460
Great.

123
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,660
Good.

124
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,460
I am Tenma.

125
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,020
I am Tenma.

126
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,400
I don't fit into Japanese society

127
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,140
I do not ask others for help

128
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,460
I don't fit in anywhere

129
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,760
I have no home to return to

130
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,960
I am alone

131
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Ah, domo domo

132
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,420
I'm sorry I'm late, guys

133
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,560
Oh, there you are, Yamamoto.

134
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,600
Inspector Lunge, you know, the one I told you about on the phone?

135
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,200
Oh, domo. I'm Yamamoto of the Munich branch of the Karafuku.

136
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,740
Domo.

137
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,620
So, how did it go with Mr. Kocht in the Czech Republic?

138
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,920
Ah, he's a tough nut.

139
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,320
Oh, yeah, that thing I was supposed to get? Done.

140
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,160
What thing?

141
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,300
You know, that one thing that Schuwald's right-hand man was asking us to get, the blonde guy.

142
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,360
That thing? That's great news!

143
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,020
Right now, kissing up to him is the best way to close a deal with Schuwvold,

144
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,060
so we gotta get on that man's good side and stay there.

145
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I went poking through all the second-hand bookstores in Prague,

146
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,500
and I was finally able to find a copy.

147
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,340
Wow, so that's the picture book you wanted.

148
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,680
Unfortunately, it's kind of worn out and the cover's coming off.

149
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,760
A little restoration and it'll be beautiful.

150
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,700
Excuse me, I think we can use a couple of beers over here.

151
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,860
Mind if I take a look?

152
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,440
No, hey, go right ahead.

153
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,820
It's written in Czech.

154
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,840
All right, it's my turn again.

155
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,700
All right!

156
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,680
All right!

157
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,600
That's great.

158
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,700
What a time, we've been waiting for you.

159
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,080
Hope you guys have been practicing.

160
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:33,300
so inspector what are you looking up in that dictionary translating check check huh so does

161
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:39,100
it have something to do with that investigation you've got going no it's a personal project i'm

162
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,320
kind of surprised to see you're doing anything that's not related to your case it's from a

163
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,940
Picture book. I like the illustration. I just wanted to know what the passage said.

164
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,340
The inspector's reading a picture book. That's something you don't see every day.

165
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,640
Look at me. Look at me.

166
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,600
The monster inside me has gotten this big.

167
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,580
I see. So Johan is pulling the strings on that billionaire.

168
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,820
Dr. Gillen, you've been telling me all about this Johan person for a while now.

169
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,980
You've painted him as quite the monster, haven't you?

170
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,060
Monster, eh?

171
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,120
Well, yeah. I mean, I've killed some people, sure.

172
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,980
But he's transformed himself into the sort of creature I could only dream of becoming.

173
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,300
This Johan has become my idol, my hero.

174
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,880
Really? Well, there is one more question that I would like to ask of you, if you don't mind.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,980
Knock yourself out.

176
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,340
If you were Johann, what would be the next move that you made?

177
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,120
Next?

178
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,280
Well, that's obvious.

179
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,820
The parents, you know, the Lieberts.

180
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,600
I think it would be time for them to die.

181
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,900
Uh, Mr. Liebert?

182
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,520
Mr. Liebert!

183
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,140
What brought you to that conclusion?

184
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,280
Because I've gotten bored.

185
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,600
Mr. Liebert, open up this door!

186
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,860
Mr. Liebert!

187
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,880
Yes, hello.

188
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,200
You're a psychologist?

189
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,600
I'm sorry, we don't understand.

190
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,020
What can we do for you, Dr. Reichwein?

191
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,700
I won't waste your time with a long-winded explanation.

192
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,340
I just want to ask some questions about your adopted son, Johan.

193
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,740
Johan? Adopted?

194
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,460
You must be mistaken.

195
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,840
That boy is our child. I gave birth to him and I...

196
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,780
That's enough, Mrs. Liebert.

197
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,540
I know for a fact that your real child is buried in Bruntal.

198
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,660
There was a fire that burned down the town hall along with all the birth records.

199
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,920
The fire allowed you to apply for a new birth certificate as if your original child were still alive.

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,300
What's this all about?

201
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,420
Look, I didn't come here to make threats, I promise you.

202
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,860
All I want to do is help if you'll let me.

203
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,060
Please, read this.

204
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,600
It's a report about Johan.

205
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,500
About Johan?

206
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,700
Yes. A friend compiled that information.

207
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
Oh.

208
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,700
I've met him.

209
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,460
He came to the house selling insurance policies.

210
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,540
That man was former detective Richard Brown.

211
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,340
He's a detective?

212
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,940
He was. He's dead now.

213
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,300
Just read.

214
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,180
The story actually starts a few years ago,

215
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,640
when an East German government official escaped and sought refuge here in West Germany in 1986.

216
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,020
What's it about? Is he after money?

217
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,300
Money? Nah, Johann couldn't care less about money.

218
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,180
Then why go after a billionaire like Schuwald in the first place?

219
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,620
You know that thing you did as a kid?

220
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,520
What thing?

221
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,920
When I was a kid, I would find a line of ants.

222
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,300
Yeah, and then I'd play with them, mess with their formation.

223
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:23,200
my god i refuse to believe this it's all simply dreadful this story is ridiculous

224
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,500
look i understand that you don't want to believe it the two of you lost your only son at a very

225
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,560
early age i know your life moves on and you wait to be blessed with a new child until one day a boy

226
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,120
nearly the same age as yours appears and to sweeten the pot the boy arrives with money

227
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,540
He provides you with a wonderful house to live in,

228
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,500
in a nice neighborhood with a beautiful garden.

229
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,540
And he provides you with love.

230
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,700
I understand that both of you want to believe in him.

231
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,440
However, everything that's written in these documents is true.

232
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,200
So who is Johan, really?

233
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,940
I need you to tell me about Johan!

234
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,560
Johan is a good boy.

235
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,420
Yes, he's just a very nice boy.

236
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,940
And he's very smart.

237
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,120
A clever boy.

238
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,700
You see, Johan is our reason for being.

239
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,220
And is that all?

240
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,380
You've been acting as his parents for years,

241
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,260
and that's all you have to say about him?

242
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,120
It's obvious neither of you knows the first thing about him.

243
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,320
I've come here because I need your help.

244
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,760
My friend Richard has already died at his hands.

245
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,220
Right now, as we speak, a man named Tenma is...

246
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,120
He's moving toward something drastic that can't be undone.

247
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,360
Please, you have to help me.

248
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,120
No, more importantly, you'll end up...

249
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,820
Like all the other couples mentioned in this report,

250
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,820
They were all previous foster parents of Johan's, just like you.

251
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
Murdered every one of them.

252
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,820
You have to leave now! If you stay, you'll die!

253
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:42,800
Oh, the apple tree bore such small fruit.

254
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,520
Uh-huh. But I think next year's apples will be much healthier.

255
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,620
That will be delightful.

256
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,740
Yes. So very delightful.

257
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,480
He's going to be killed by a Japanese guy soon.

258
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,320
Is that what Johan is telling those kids?

259
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,880
Correct. What do you think? What's it mean?

260
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Well, he's not thinking about suicide, that's for sure.

261
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,160
Okay, but what does it mean?

262
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,560
Man, who really knows what goes on in a brilliant mind like that.

263
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,680
Although, I can at least say this much.

264
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,240
If nuclear war broke out and the world burned to ash, he'd still be standing.

265
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:44,980
he's basically telling us that there's nothing we can do and he's right everything we've done

266
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,700
so far has led us absolutely nowhere my god we weren't even able to save poor richard

267
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,260
look we can't just throw in the towel but we still haven't been able to track down dr tenma

268
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,960
oh face it we couldn't stop him from trying to kill johan even if we wanted to it's been in fame

269
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,860
Dr. Reichwein, please. We need to try and remain calm here.

270
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,080
Yeah, you're right.

271
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,260
He talked about breaking up the line of ants.

272
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,940
Even ants possess souls.

273
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,600
Doctor, where are you going?

274
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,760
At this point, we've got nothing to lose, do we?

275
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,160
Huh?

276
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,700
It's time to tell the old man our story.

277
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,080
I'm going to have a little talk with Schuwald.

278
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,120
What? An additional 50 chairs?

279
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,680
So many people. This list just keeps growing and growing.

280
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,900
You mean all of this is just for Mr. Schuwald's book donation ceremony?

281
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,180
Yeah. A lot of VIPs have been added. It's turning into a pretty big thing.

282
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,060
I guess everything Schuwald does is bound to turn into an event.

283
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:12,700
the library will be closing shortly

284
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,480
again

285
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,280
the library will be closing shortly

286
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:43,800
Excuse me.

287
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,600
I'm sorry, but could you get that book down for me?

288
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,220
It's that Czech dictionary up on the top. I can't reach it.

289
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,500
Oh, okay. Is this it?

290
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,660
Yes. I'm sorry. Thanks a lot.

291
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,420
Sure.

292
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,600
Actually, I'm borrowing a Czech picture book. I'm trying to translate it.

293
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,140
I see.

294
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,380
Would you believe it? My friend collapsed right here out of nowhere while looking at this book.

295
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,440
Oh.

296
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,840
I thought that maybe there was something in the book that could have triggered that response.

297
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,960
So your friend, he's all right now?

298
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,840
Yeah, he's fine. Thanks again.

299
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,740
Sure.

300
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,540
Let's see.

301
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,960
Once upon a time in a land far away,

302
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:53,480
there lived a nameless monster.

303
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,400
He was dying to have a name.

304
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,340
So the monster--

305
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,060
so the monster made up his mind to set out on a journey

306
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,020
to look for one.

307
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,020
Weird book.

308
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,520
We're closing up, hon.

309
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,740
OK.

310
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,760
And we'll be closed tomorrow for the ceremony.
