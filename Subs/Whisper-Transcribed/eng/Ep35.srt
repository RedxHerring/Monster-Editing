1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,840
Domo, your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,600
Thank you. It's a pleasure doing business with you.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,020
Perhaps the next time we meet, it should be over a round of golf. What do you say to that, huh?

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,720
All right, but only if you promise to go easy on us.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,480
Of course. I'm looking forward to it.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,540
Oh, Domo.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,060
Domo.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:25,860
Domo.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:33,940
Domo this, domo that. It's a thoroughly incomprehensible culture.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,380
Ah, domo, domo. Apologies for the wait. My meeting ran a little longer than expected.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,900
The name is Iwai of the Katafuku Corporation, Munich branch.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,260
Inspector Lunge of the BKA.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,080
Pleased to meet you.

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,160
"Domo."

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:06,820
"A domo and a bow! That was unexpected. Coffee. Oh, and a refill for him, too. My apologies,

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,540
I know you were expecting to meet with Yamamoto today. There was an emergency in the Czech

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,960
Republic, but he's expected back in town sometime tomorrow."

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,520
"You seem rather busy."

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,320
Oh yes, I mean, you've heard. Mr. Schuwald's corporate dynasty?

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,020
Ever since he came out of seclusion and resumed his financial activities,

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,360
all of his affiliate companies and related businesses throughout Germany have been very active.

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,540
The whole Japanese business community is desperately vying for his attention!

23
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,320
Why is he laughing?

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,200
So, Mr. Yamamoto will not be able to meet with you today.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,040
But I can say that I knew Kenzo Tenma just as well as he did, so feel free to ask anything.

26
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,520
But of course.

27
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,460
I have to say, Inspector, I'm shocked. He's still under investigation?

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,100
Well, I'll just say that we haven't come to any conclusions.

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,300
I was floored to hear Tenma named as a suspect in your investigation. I couldn't have imagined such a thing.

30
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,460
You just said you felt shocked. Was it really that unexpected?

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Absolutely. Kenzo Tenma, a killer?

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,040
Come on, it's just crazy. Not in a million years would I have pegged Tenma as a killer.

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,720
We had drinks a couple of times. I guess about three years ago. He really didn't seem like a bad guy.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,940
So he really didn't seem like a bad guy. You're saying you thought he was a good guy then?

35
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,520
A good guy? Let's see. I think "reserved" would be the word I'd use to describe Tenma.

36
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,020
What you're saying, then, is that not being open is what makes him a good man.

37
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,240
Well, it didn't prevent him from being social. That's what I meant by "not a bad guy."

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,800
(laughs)

39
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,300
Japanese people don't normally wear these sorts of clothes.

40
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,700
Japanese people are skillful with chopsticks.

41
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,840
So now I will be Japanese.

42
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,060
Domo.

43
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,920
I'm Japanese.

44
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,740
I am a Japanese man.

45
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,940
I am a Japanese man.

46
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,680
I am Tenma.

47
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,920
Hello.

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,080
Um, father?

49
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,300
Yes?

50
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,760
It's me. How are you?

51
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
I'm fine.

52
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,300
I called because I heard you were in Munich.

53
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,080
I live here now.

54
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,820
Actually, Father, I'm a mother now.

55
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,160
I had my baby.

56
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,560
I thought you'd want to know.

57
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,720
I see. That's good.

58
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,820
I know a lot of things have been said between us.

59
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,440
But I want you to see your grandchild.

60
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,600
Will you see us?

61
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,860
Well, would tomorrow be okay?

62
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,820
Yes, as long as it's after six.

63
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,880
Where would you like to meet?

64
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,840
Near Mary in Platz?

65
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,500
Okay. All right.

66
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,300
See you then.

67
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,500
Domo.

68
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,660
What?

69
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,940
Hey, you're pretty good with those chopsticks, you know that?

70
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Is that so?

71
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,720
Sure, these days I see a lot of foreigners using chopsticks better than native Japanese.

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,400
So, Dr. Takahashi, as a former colleague of Tenma's, what would you say was your impression of him?

73
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,460
Let's see...

74
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:19,900
Well, as I remember, he wasn't a hard guy to like, though he was occasionally more than a bit indecisive.

75
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,480
Still...

76
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,260
Go on.

77
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,520
With a scalpel in his hand, he was a whole other person.

78
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,180
People called him a genius brain surgeon, and I can say that was no exaggeration.

79
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,240
What about his parents?

80
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,140
Hmm. He never really talked about his parents much.

81
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,560
But he said his father and older brother were doctors also,

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,820
so I guess they put him on the physician's path whether he liked it or not.

83
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,960
In fact, I think I remember him saying he hadn't been back to Japan since coming to Germany for medical school.

84
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,940
In fact, his parents didn't come to Germany at all to support him when the scandal broke.

85
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,580
I don't think they made any public appeal for their son's innocence either.

86
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,040
I guess he and his family weren't all that tight-knit.

87
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,120
You know what I mean?

88
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,580
Thanks for waiting.

89
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,440
Sorry it's taken so long, but we've just gotten word from Yamamoto.

90
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,900
He's left Prague and is back in Munich,

91
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,500
but unfortunately he has a client whose needs must be tended to immediately.

92
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,400
He seems to be a busy man.

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,420
If it's any consolation, he did say he was going to join all of us at a bar after work.

94
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,020
A bar?

95
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,200
That's right. Care to join us for a drink, Inspector?

96
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,780
The Fates have delivered you this opportunity.

97
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,040
After all, it's always good to make a few new contacts.

98
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,700
No. Tonight I have to.

99
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,300
I guess he and his family weren't all that tight-knit, you know what I mean?

100
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,160
I am... Tenma.

101
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,180
Sounds great. I would be happy to join you tonight.

Ah, he's a tough nut.

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,340
- Oh yeah, that thing I was supposed to get, done.

130
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,160
- What thing?

131
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,400
- You know, that one thing that Shuvald's right-hand man

132
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,300
was asking us to get, the blonde guy.

- Wow, so that's the picture book you wanted.

No.

159
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,140
It's a personal project.

160
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,400
I'm kind of surprised to see you're doing anything that's not related to your case.

161
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,980
It's from a picture book.

162

I like the illustration.

163
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,980
I just wanted to know what the passage said

You've painted him as quite the monster, haven't you?

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,120
Well, yeah. I mean, I've killed some people, sure.

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,980
But he's transformed himself into the sort of creature I could only dream of becoming.

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,320
This Johan has become my idol, my hero.

174
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,860
Really? Well, there is one more question that I would like to ask of you, if you don't mind.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,980
Knock yourself out.

176
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,340
Poor Johan, what would be the next move that you made?

177
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,100
Next?

178
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,280
Well, that's obvious.

179
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,800
The parents, you know, the Lieberts.

180
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,600
I think it would be time for them to die.

181
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,920
Uh, Mr. Liebert?

182
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,520
Mr. Liebert!

183
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,140
What brought you to that conclusion?

184
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,840
Because...

185
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,280
I've gotten bored.

186
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,580
Mr. Liebert, open up this door!

187
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:12,920
Mrs. Liebert!

188
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,860
Yes, hello.

189
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,580
You're a psychologist? I'm sorry, we don't understand.

190
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,040
What can we do for you, Dr. Reichwein?

191
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,680
I won't waste your time with a long-winded explanation.

192
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,320
I just want to ask some questions about your adopted son, Johan.

193
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,740
Johan? Adopted?

194
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,680
You must be mistaken. That boy is our child. I gave birth to him and I--

195
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,760
That's enough, Mrs. Liebert.

196
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,520
for a fact that your real child is buried in Bruntal.

197
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,160
There was a fire that burned down the town hall

198
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,660
along with all the birth records.

199
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,480
The fire allowed you to apply for a new birth certificate

200
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,920
as if your original child were still alive.

201
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,320
- What's this all about?

202
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,420
- Look, I didn't come here to make threats, I promise you.

203
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,840
All I want to do is help if you'll let me.

204
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
Please, read this.

205
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,580
It's a report about Johan.

206
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,040
About Johan?

207
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,200
Yes. A friend compiled that information.

208
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,340
Oh!

209
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,000
I've met him. He came to the house selling insurance policies.

210
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,960
That man was former detective Richard Brown.

211
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,400
He's a detective?

212
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,540
He was. He's dead now.

213
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,560
Just read.

214
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,700
The story actually starts a few years ago,

215
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,660
when an East German government official escaped

216
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,580
and sought refuge here in West Germany in 1986.

217
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,020
What's it about? Is he after money?

218
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,320
Money? Nah, Johann couldn't care less about money.

219
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,160
Then why go after a billionaire like Schuwald in the first place?

220
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,640
You know that thing you did as a kid?

221
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,540
What thing?

222
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,900
When I was a kid, I would find a line of ants.

223
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,300
Yeah, and then I'd play with 'em. Mess with their formation.

224
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,720
My God.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,340
I refuse to believe this. It's all simply dreadful.

226
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,180
This story's ridiculous.

227
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,060
Look, I understand that you don't want to believe it.

228
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,260
The two of you lost your only son at a very early age.

229
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,220
I know. Your life moves on and you wait to be blessed with a new child

230
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,580
until one day a boy nearly the same age as yours appears.

231
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,120
And to sweeten the pot, the boy arrives with money.

232
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,540
He provides you with a wonderful house to live in,

233
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,500
in a nice neighborhood, with a beautiful garden.

234
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,540
And he provides you with love.

235
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,700
I understand that both of you want to believe in him.

236
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,680
However, everything that's written

237
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,440
in these documents is true.

238
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,180
So who is Johan, really?

239
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,920
I need you to tell me about Yohan!

240
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,540
Yohan is a good boy.

241
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,400
Yes, he's just a very nice boy.

242
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,800
And he's very smart.

243
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,100
A clever boy.

244
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,680
You see, Yohan is our reason for being.

245
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,220
And is that all?

246
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,380
You've been acting as his parents for years,

247
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,260
and that's all you have to say about him?

248
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,120
It's obvious neither of you knows the first thing about him.

249
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,320
I've come here because I need your help.

250
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,740
My friend Richard has already died at his hands.

251
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,200
Right now, as we speak, a man named Tenma is...

252
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,120
He's moving toward something drastic that can't be undone.

253
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,360
Please, you have to help me.

254
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,800
No, more importantly, you'll end up like all the other couples mentioned in this report.

255
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,660
They were all previous foster parents of Johan's just like you.

256
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,060
Murdered every one of them.

257
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,720
You have to leave now. If you stay, you'll die.

258
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,840
Oh, the apple tree bore such small fruit.

259
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,520
Uh-huh. But I think next year's apples will be much healthier.

260
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,600
That will be delightful.

261
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,720
Yes. So very delightful.

262
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,500
He's going to be killed by a Japanese guy soon.

263
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,320
Is that what Johan is telling those kids?

264
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,880
Correct. What do you think? What's it mean?

265
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,820
Well, he's not thinking about suicide, that's for sure.

266
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,160
Okay, but what does it mean?

267
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,560
Man, who really knows what goes on in a brilliant mind like that.

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,680
Although, I can at least say this much.

269
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,280
If nuclear war broke out and the world burned to ash, he'd still be standing.

270
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,080
He's basically telling us that there's nothing we can do.

271
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,340
And he's right. Everything we've done so far has led us absolutely nowhere.

272
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,540
My God, we weren't even able to save poor Richard.

273
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,120
Look, we can't just throw in the towel.

274
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,240
But we still haven't been able to track down Dr. Tenma.

275
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,780
Aw, face it, we couldn't stop him from trying to kill Johan even if we wanted to.

276
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,900
It's been in vain!

277
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,820
Dr. Reichwein, please! We need to try and remain calm here.

278
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,060
Yeah, you're right.

279
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,260
He talked about breaking up the line of ants.

280
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,960
Even ants possess souls.

281
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,600
Doctor, where are you going?

282
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,780
At this point, we've got nothing to lose, do we?

283
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,160
Huh?

284
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,700
It's time to tell the old man our story.

285
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,160
I'm going to have a little talk with Shuvald.

286
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,120
What? An additional 50 chairs?

287
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,660
So many people. This list just keeps growing and growing.

288
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,900
You mean all of this is just for Mr. Shuvalt's book donation ceremony?

289
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,180
Yeah. A lot of VIPs have been added. It's turning into a pretty big thing.

290
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,060
I guess everything Shuvalt does is bound to turn into an event.

291
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,660
The library will be closing shortly.

292
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,340
Again, the library will be closing shortly.

293
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,820
Excuse me.

294
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,600
I'm sorry, but could you get that book down for me?

295
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,220
It's that Czech dictionary up on the top. I can't reach it.

296
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,500
Oh, okay. Is this it?

297
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,660
Yes. I'm sorry. Thanks a lot.

298
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,420
Sure.

299
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,000
Actually, I'm borrowing a Czech picture book.

300
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,580
I'm trying to translate it.

301
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,140
I see.

302
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,560
Would you believe it?

303
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,380
My friend collapsed right here out of nowhere while looking at this book.

304
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,440
Oh.

305
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,840
I thought that maybe there was something in the book that could have triggered that response.

306
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,960
So your friend, he's alright now?

307
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,820
Yeah, he's fine. Thanks again.

308
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,720
Sure.

309
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,490
Let's see...

310
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,140
Once upon a time in a land far away...

311
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,460
There lived a nameless monster.

312
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,720
He was dying to have a name.

313
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,500
So the monster...

314
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,980
So the monster made up his mind to set out on a journey to look for one.

315
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,100
Huh. Weird book.

316
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,000
We're closing up, hon.

317
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:14,900
'Kay.

318
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,660
And we'll be closed tomorrow for the ceremony.

319
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,480
[MUSIC]

320
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,540
[MUSIC]

321
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,640
(gentle music)
