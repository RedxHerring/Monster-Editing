84
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:36,020

85
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,980
just like the rest of us, and here it is. I'll read these now, with your permission. Trust me,

86
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,340
run deep. It all started back in 1986 when a nearly dead young boy was rushed

87
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,380
to the emergency room in Dusseldorf with a gunshot wound to the head.

88
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:09,140
And that's when he started up as one of your student readers. My murdered friend

89
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,720
Richard had a theory. He theorized that Johan was the one who put the Farren boy up to pretending

90
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,180
to be your son in the first place. It worked damn well, but then your real son entered

91
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,780
the picture and Johan changed plans. He quickly latched onto Carl and Farren was a loose end.

92
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,240
He put Farren up to one last thing, suicide. Sir, how did you come to be reunited with

93
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,340
your long-lost sons, quite a feat after all this time.

94
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,440
I want you to think very carefully

95
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,180
about how many people close to you

96
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,120
have died over the last few years.

97
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,180
The driver who had worked for you so unfailingly,

98
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,340

99

the accountant with whom you'd go birdwatching,

100
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,440
dead, every last one of them.

101
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,880
Your Johan murdered them all, don't you see that?

102
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,960
To create an empty space in your heart

103
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,160
and then fill it himself.

104
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,120

105
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,740

111
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,860

116
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,820
that nickname pleased me very much.

just like this.

124
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,380
I see that boy fast becoming the person I've tried so hard to be.

125
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,200
They worship the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worship

126
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,600
the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?"

127
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
The revelation of St. John the Divine, is it not?

128

The only thing that can defeat the beast

129
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,200
would be a monster more fearsome than the first.

Oh, I see.

161
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,420
In that case, could you let her know I'm leaving Munich on the three o'clock train?

162
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,860
Yes, of course. Oh, and what was your name again, dear?

163
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,620
It's Nina. Nina Fortner.

- You have seen the guest list, right?

171
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,860
- Of course.

172
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
It's a real who's who.

173
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,880

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,820
sends ripples throughout Europe.

180
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,720
He plays the continent's economy like a marionette.

181
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,500
- This is his first public appearance

182
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,800
in I don't know how long.

183
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,320
They all turned out to see the legend in person.

184
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,380
- The charity's fine,

185
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,900
but donating his personal library like this,

186
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,660
doesn't it seem a bit, well, final?

187
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,240
- Hey, don't say that.

188
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,860
- He's the keystone of the EU.

189
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,200
We can't have him calling in a day just yet.

190
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,780
Carl?

191
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,120
Yes?

192
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,460
I forgot some papers. I need you to go retrieve them for me.

193
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,780
Sure. What kind of papers are they?

194
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,180
Just go to the mansion and get them.

195
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,360
They're on the desk in the study.

196
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,400
But Father, you...

197
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,600
Johan will be here soon enough.

198
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,220
Leave everything to him.

199
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,600
Oh, okay.

200
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,020
What's going on with the investigation, Inspector?

201
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,240
Why, it's proceeding smoothly.

202
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,800
Proceeding smoothly?

203
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,080
I told you Tenma was in Munich because I thought I'd convince you with my information.

204
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,880
I thought you were ready to exonerate him.

205
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,220
But you haven't done a damn thing with it!

206
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,020
Did you even bother to check on Shuvald's secretary, Johann Liebert?

207
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,720
Don't you see there's absolutely no doubting he's the mastermind behind all of these murders?

208
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,480
Are you even listening to me?

209
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,400
If you don't hurry, Tenma will …

210
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,220
If you don't hurry and take action, Tenma will stop Johann the only way he can!

211
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,100
Calm yourself, Doctor. My investigation is going exactly as planned, I assure you.

212
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,980
If that's all…

213
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,900
Yohan is real! He's right in front of us! Open your eyes, Lüge!

214
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,920
Indeed, spoken like a true criminal psychologist.

215
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,360
He's right in front of us. I harbor no doubt regarding Yohan's existence.

216
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,400
Yohan does exist. Within Tenma's head, that is.

217
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,680
So what's the latest? Have you gathered any new information?

218
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,800
Nope. This guy keeps singing the same old song.

219
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,740
The gun in question turned out to be a Mauser SR-93. Says he sold it to a Japanese man.

220
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,400
You want us to tighten the screws?

221
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,240
No. That's probably the extent of what he knows.

222
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,900
A Mauser SR-93 is a sniper rifle, unless I'm mistaken.

223
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,540
Yeah. High-precision model.

224
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,180
Who on earth could he be targeting?

225
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,700
I am Tenma.

226
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:13,320
I am Kenzo Tenma, and I've recently come into possession of a powerful sniper rifle.

227
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:23,120
My name is Tenma, but sometimes my name is Johann Liebert.

228
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,800
I killed the hospital directors, and now I have this high-precision gun.

229
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:36,300
I killed several middle-aged couples across Germany, and now, who am I going to kill next?

230
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:41,120
I am chaos incarnate.

231
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,720
I embrace chaos.

232
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,620
(dramatic music)

233
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,080
(thunder rumbling)

234
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,400
- Mm.

235
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,100
- You should probably eat something, you know.

236
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,240
- Oh, thank you, Dieter.

237
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,620
I'm okay.

238
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,040
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

239
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,480
I'm not throwing in the towel, no sir.

240
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,560
I know I'm not much to look at these days Dieter, but I served as a medic with the Border Patrol. I'm still plenty tough.

241
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,160
I'm going to save your doctor friend no matter what. I promise.

242
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,540
Don't underestimate a former police doctor.

243
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,500
Now, since you went to the trouble of making me all this, I think I'll dig in.

244
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,920
I mean, no one should fight on an empty stomach, right Dieter?

245
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,980
(Groaning)

246
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,580
(Thud)

247
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,440
(Gasping)

248
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,940
Of course.

249
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,120
Hey, where are you going?

250
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,920
Schubert's book donation ceremony.

251
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,220
You wait here.

252
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,160
And Tenma's there, right?

253
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,460
Don't follow me, Dieter.

254
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,580
Stay here.

255
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:19,960
(Panting)

256
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,460
It's Schuwald.

257
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,440
Huh?

258
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,900
I need to speak with Hans-Georg Schuwald now.

259
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,140
Call his estate.

260
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,440
Yes, sir.

261
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:32,940
Wait.

262
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,060
Unless I've got the date wrong,

263
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,900
today is his book donation ceremony

264
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,780
at the University of Munich library.

265
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,060
We've got an emergency.

266
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:41,960
Huh?

267
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,480
I know Tenma's next target.

268
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,380
And it's Schuwald.

269
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,980
And so, in light of his generous donation,

270
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,580
only fitting that we honor our benefactor.

271
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,300
Please help me welcome Mr. Hans-Georg Schuwald.

272
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,220
(audience applauding)

273
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,700
- Where's Johann?

274
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,320
Is my secretary in the library?

275
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,380
- Huh?

276
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,760
Ah, he's right over there.

277
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,500
(rain pattering)

278
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
You've come.

279
00:20:52,340 --> 00:21:02,820
I brought him back to life, that monster, I brought him back.

280
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,980
[footsteps]

281
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,540
Lina! Wait!

282
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,620
Lona! I'm so glad you came!

283
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,060
I tried, but the person I'm looking for...

284
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,180
I'm not going to find them here after all.

285
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,120
And we were just getting to be friends, too. I'm sorry.

286
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,960
You're twins, right? You gotta be! You look just like him!

287
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,000
You are, aren't you? Well, aren't you?

288
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,400
What's this picture book?

289
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,440
'Cause this is what he was looking at when he started screaming!

290
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,040
Book?

291
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,820
(thunder rumbling)

292
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,120
- Gil?

293
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,240
