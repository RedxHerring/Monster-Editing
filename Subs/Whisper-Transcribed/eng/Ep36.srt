1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
Has there been any change in his condition?

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,620
Well, uh, no, but Doctor...

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,100
And his pulse and blood pressure.

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,800
Dr. Tenma, what about Mayor Roddicker's operation?

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,520
Let's begin the surgery.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,120
Uh, right.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,960
wait what's our patient's name huh I want to know the boy's name well so we

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:52,720
don't even know his name it's all right hang in there I'll save you

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:26,240
Dr. Tenma! We have a problem! Those kids! Twins! The boy and the girl!

10
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,740
Did you search the entire hospital?

11
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,880
- I already checked, but they're both gone.

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,300
- Maybe they're off playing hide and seek

13
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,400
or something like that.

14
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,560
- They're off playing hide and seek

15
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,920
or something like that.

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,060
Something like that.

17
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:27,720
I don't know.

18
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:41,540
scaredy cat ten ma scaredy cat ten ma

19
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,380

20
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,780
keep it up and you're gonna pee your pants again just like last time

21
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,420
It's getting late, kids.

22
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,840
Time for everybody to head on home, okay?

23
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,980
Bye!

24
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,300
We'll see you guys later!

25
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,520
See you later!

26
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,200
Okay, bye!

27
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,600
Wait, I'm still here.

28
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,360
Hold on, guys.

29
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,320
I was right here all this time.

30
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,300
Won't someone find me already, please?

31
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,720
I'm right over here!

32
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,900
Come find me!

33
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,360
Scary cat, Tenma.

34
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:07,740
♪ Where art thou deep in this land? ♪

35
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:17,740
♪ ♪

36
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:47,720
We'll be right back.

37
00:04:47,740 --> 00:05:17,720
We'll see you next time.

38
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:35,780
That man who stopped by earlier this evening, he's still standing in front of the main gate, sir.

39
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,060
How should I proceed?

40
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,100
Well, who is he?

41
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,380
He said he was Richard Brown's psychologist, Brown being that private detective you hired.

42
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,900
I'll just go eject him from the premises, sir.

43
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,700
My son, I need you to tell me what you see when you look at this man.

44
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,480
Right. He's short and older.

45
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,760
What about his character? Look deeper.

46
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,720
I think he's a good person. I couldn't tell you why.

47
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,180
And now I'm staring into his eyes, and a desperate man is staring back at me.

48
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,120
I understand.

49
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:28,200
Thank you for agreeing to see me, Mr. Schuvold. I know it's late.

50
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,200
Well, your thanks are wasted on me, Doctor. My patience runs short.

51
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,760
Speak your piece and be on your way.

52
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,120
I agree. Let's cut right to the chase.

53
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,560
You'll be happy to know the length of this conversation depends entirely on you.

54
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,760
I'm assuming you came here to talk about the boy.

55
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,820
Huh?

56
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
About Johann.

57
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Your silence speaks volumes, Doctor.

58
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,740
I knew this day would come eventually.

59
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,740
That sooner or later, someone like you would knock on my door.

60
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,740
And maybe shed some light on the grand mystery.

61
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Mystery?

62
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,740
How any person could ever be that perfect.

63
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:22,340
I imagine having one's sight just confuses the matter, but I can always sense it.

64
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,420
Yes, the presence of something so unerringly precise, like Johann.

65
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,640
I feel as though he's not of this world at all.

66
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
I do.

67
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,980
Oh, he's very much of this world, I assure you.

68
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,860
And he's left a paper trail just like the rest of us, and here it is.

69
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,520
I'll read these now, with your permission.

70
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,760
Trust me, his imperfections run deep.

71
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:50,240
It all started back in 1986 when a nearly dead young boy was rushed to the emergency

72
00:07:50,240 --> 00:08:03,080
room in Dusseldorf with a gunshot wound to the head.

73
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,280
And that's when he started up as one of your student readers.

74
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,980
My murdered friend Richard had a theory.

75
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,240
He theorized that Johann was the one who put the Farren boy up to pretending to be your

76
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,280
son in the first place.

77
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,980
It worked damn well, but then your real son entered the picture and Johann changed plans.

78
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,620
He quickly latched on to Karl, and Farren was a loose end.

79
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,360
He put Farren up to one last thing: suicide.

80
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,300
Sir, how did you come to be reunited with your long-lost son?

81
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,820
It's quite a feat after all this time.

82
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,040
I want you to think very carefully about how many people close to you have died over the

83
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,860
last few years.

84
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,300
The driver who had worked for you so unfailingly, the maid who'd read books to you, the accountant

85
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,680
with whom you'd go birdwatching, dead, every last one of them.

86
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,340
Your Johann murdered them all, don't you see that?

87
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,600
To create an empty space in your heart and then fill it himself.

88
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,420
We have to drag that boy's evil into the light of day.

89
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,380
But I can't do it without your help, Mr. Shuvold.

90
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,480
If we don't do something to stop Johan right now,

91
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,980
Dr. Tenma will!

92
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,360
- Didn't you say Johan toys with people

93
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,460
as though he's playing with a line of ants

94
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,200
taking delight in their pain?

95
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,220
To him, we're nothing but insects.

96
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,880
You must know what people call me,

97
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,940
that infamous nickname of mine.

98
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,380
Oh, yes, the much-feared vampire of Bavaria.

99
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,820
I'll be straight with you, that nickname pleased me very much.

100
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,200
I'd push myself harder and harder, never relenting, and oh, how it did grow.

101
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,860
How it swelled the monster inside me.

102
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,800
But to what avail?

103
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,620
They speak my name with such reverence, but now I'm a withered husk.

104
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,680
I, too, longed to toy with people,

105
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,780
as though they were nothing more than a line of ants,

106
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,780
just like this.

107
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,380
I see that boy fast becoming the person I've tried so hard to be.

108
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,400
They worship the dragon,

109
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,120
for he had given his authority to the beast,

110
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,420
and they worship the beast, saying,

111
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,000
Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?

112
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,540
The revelation of St. John the Divine, is it not?

113
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,300
The only thing that can defeat the beast

114
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,160
would be a monster more fearsome than the first.

115
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,380
Father?

116
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,560
Hmm?

117
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,260
What was that about? You talked all night.

118
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,160
Tell me, Carl. Where's Johan?

119
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,080
Oh, he said he's heading straight to the ceremony after he wraps things up at Esterhoven's office.

120
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,960
But, Father, you're looking pretty worn out. If you want me to cancel your appearance, I will.

121
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,900
No. Let's get ready to go to the ceremony.

122
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Dr. Tenma, you're not to blame.

123
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,900
You did your job as a doctor, and you did your best.

124
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,900
You are not to blame.

125
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,900
Please live on, and continue to save as many people as you are able to.

126
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
Nina...

127
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,960
Well, that's a real shame.

128
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,220
So, you're going to call it quits, huh?

129
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,280
And just when you were really starting to get the hang of it.

130
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,160
Thanks again for the job, sir.

131
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,800
Well, be sure to visit if you're ever down this way.

132
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,440
Sure. Well, goodbye.

133
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,700
She was such a pleasant little thing, too.

134
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,360
Uh, hello. May I speak to Loda Frank, please?

135
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,320
Oh, I'm sorry. Loda's out at the moment.

136
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,160
Oh, I see.

137
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,400
In that case, could you let her know I'm leaving Munich on the three o'clock train?

138
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,820
Yes, of course.

139
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,880
Oh, and what was your name again, dear?

140
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,260
It's Nina.

141
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,620
Nina Fortner.

142
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:41,700
He's here. His car just pulled up at the rear entrance.

143
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,340
The vampire of Bavaria. Out in the sun, no less.

144
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,740
Shh. He'll hear you.

145
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,220
You have seen the guest list, right?

146
00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:02,160
Of course. It's a real who's who. And not just a Bavaria. Business figures from all over Europe and Japan. Even ambassadors and government officials.

147
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,660
This is hardly a simple book donation ceremony, wouldn't you agree?

148
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:12,720
Yeah. They say every move Shuvald makes sends ripples throughout Europe. He plays the continent's economy like a marionette.

149
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,340
This is his first public appearance in I don't know how long. They all turned out to see the legend in person.

150
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:24,680
The charity's fine, but donating his personal library like this, doesn't it seem a bit, well, final?

151
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,240
Hey, don't say that.

152
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,180
He's the keystone of the EU. We can't have him calling it a day just yet.

153
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,760
Carl?

154
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,120
Yes?

155
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,460
I forgot some papers. I need you to go retrieve them for me.

156
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,780
Well, sure. What kind of papers are they?

157
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,340
Just go to the mansion and get them. They're on the desk in the study.

158
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,400
But, Father, you…

159
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,600
Johan will be here soon enough.

160
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,220
Leave everything to him.

161
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,440
Oh, okay.

162
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:56,540
Okay.

163
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,000
What's going on with the investigation, Inspector?

164
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,240
Why, it's proceeding smoothly.

165
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,780
Proceeding smoothly?

166
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,180
What?

167
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,080
I told you Temma was in Munich because I thought I'd convince you with my information.

168
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,920
I thought you were ready to exonerate him.

169
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,220
But you haven't done a damn thing with it!

170
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,020
Did you even bother to check on Schuwald's secretary, Johann Liebert?

171
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,740
Don't you see there's absolutely no doubting he's the mastermind behind all of these murders?

172
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,480
Are you even listening to me?

173
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,560
If you don't hurry, Tenma will...

174
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,180
If you don't hurry and take action, Tenma will stop Johann the only way he can!

175
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,840
Calm yourself, Doctor.

176
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,120
My investigation is going exactly as planned, I assure you.

177
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,980
If that's all…

178
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,460
Johan is real. He's right in front of us.

179
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,000
Open your eyes, Lungay.

180
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,920
Indeed, spoken like a true criminal psychologist.

181
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,100
He's right in front of us.

182
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,520
I harbor no doubt regarding Johan's existence.

183
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,360
Johan does exist.

184
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,400
Within Tenma's head, that is.

185
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,660
So what's the latest? Have you gathered any new information?

186
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,800
Nope. This guy keeps singing the same old song.

187
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,220
The gun in question turned out to be a Mauser SR-93.

188
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,740
Says he sold it to a Japanese man.

189
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,400
You want us to tighten the screws?

190
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,240
No. That's probably the extent of what he knows.

191
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:46,900
Yeah.

192
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,900
A Mauser SR-93 is a sniper rifle, unless I'm mistaken.

193
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,560
Yeah, high-precision model.

194
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,180
Who on earth could he be targeting?

195
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,680
I am Tenma.

196
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,240
I am Kenzo Tenma,

197
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,320
and I've recently come into possession of a powerful sniper rifle.

198
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,720
My name is Tenma,

199
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,720
but sometimes my name...

200
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,720
...is Johann Liebert.

201
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,720
I killed the hospital directors, and now I have this high-precision gun.

202
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I killed several middle-aged couples across Germany.

203
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,720
And now, who am I going to kill next?

204
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,720
I am chaos incarnate.

205
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,720
I embrace chaos.

206
00:17:50,720 --> 00:18:13,400
you should probably eat something you know oh thank you Dieter I'm okay I'm

207
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,820
just a little tired that's all I'm not throwing in the towel

208
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,380
No, sir.

209
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,840
I know I'm not much to look at these days, Dieter,

210
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,260
but I served as a medic with the border patrol.

211
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,100
I'm still plenty tough.

212
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,340
I'm going to save your doctor friend no matter what.

213
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,500
I promise.

214
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,860
Don't underestimate a former police doctor.

215
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,280
Now, since you went to the trouble of making me all this,

216
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,700
I think I'll dig in.

217
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,360
I mean, no one should fight on an empty stomach,

218
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,200
right, Dieter?

219
00:18:49,820 --> 00:19:03,960
of course

220
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,180
hey where are you going

221
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,940
Schuwalt's book donation ceremony

222
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,780
you wait here

223
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,180
and Tenma's there right

224
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,480
don't follow me Dieter

225
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,680
stay here

226
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,480
It's Schuwald.

227
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,460
Huh?

228
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,900
I need to speak with Hans-Georg Schuwald now.

229
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,140
Call his estate.

230
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,440
Yes, sir.

231
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:32,940
Wait.

232
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,060
Unless I've got the date wrong,

233
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,860
today is his book donation ceremony

234
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,660
at the University of Munich library.

235
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,060
We've got an emergency.

236
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:41,940
Huh?

237
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,480
I know Tenma's next target.

238
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,380
And it's Schuwald.

239
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,580
And so, in light of his generous donation, it's only fitting that we honor our benefactor.

240
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,280
Please help me welcome Mr. Hans-Georg Schuval.

241
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,360
Where's Johann? Is my secretary in the library?

242
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,500
Huh? Um...

243
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,760
Ah, he's right over there.

244
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:29,160
You've come.

245
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:56,440
I brought him back to life.

246
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,820
That monster, I brought him back.

247
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,800
Nina! Wait!

248
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,640
Lona! I'm so glad you came.

249
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:23,200
I tried, but the person I'm looking for, I'm not going to find them here after all.

250
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,140
And we were just getting to be friends, too. I'm sorry.

251
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,960
You're twins, right? You gotta be, you look just like him!

252
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,980
You are, aren't you? Well, aren't you?

253
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,400
What's this picture book? Cause this is what he was looking at when he started screaming!

254
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,060
A book?

255
00:21:46,380 --> 00:22:16,360
I'll be right back.
