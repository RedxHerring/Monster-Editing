1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,780
Where's the crime scene?

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,020
Down those stairs.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,100
How many victims?

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,260
Three men, detective.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,200
You can start looking for any evidence up here.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,820
Before we start taking any action, shouldn't we wait for Detective Kratki to arrive? I mean...

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,140
I'm taking charge here. Start looking for witnesses, or anyone suspicious.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,360
But there aren't any people around here.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,340
I said look for anyone suspicious!

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,240
But no one's here.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,380
Are you telling me you can't follow my orders because I'm a rookie?

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,580
Get moving!

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,340
I'm Detective Suk, Prague Police.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,120
As crime scenes go, this one is pretty brutal.

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,760
Yeah.

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,620
Inspector Zemot.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,680
He was savagely beaten to death.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,180
I can't even make out his facial features.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,500
His face is completely unrecognizable.

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,440
I guess it's good he had his police ID with him.

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,000
Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to figure out who he was.

22
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,860
The bodies of two other men are over there.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,600
We haven't been able to figure out who they are.

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,200
One took a gunshot to the head.

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,920
The other was beaten to death like the inspector.

26
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,260
Preserve the crime scene!

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,540
Yeah, so I haven't found anyone suspicious yet, sir.

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,980
(dramatic music)

29
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,080
I'm telling you, it stinks.

30
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,600
They make fun of me just because I'm a rookie.

31
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,600
The other police guys all look at me like I'm crazy when I give them an order.

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,040
You have to work to earn their respect before they'll listen to you.

33
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,860
He's right.

34
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,280
I'm a detective!

35
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,180
Yeah, you're a rookie detective.

36
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,800
And when you got to the crime scene, you took one look and lost your lunch.

37
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,180
Just because you grew up liking cop TV shows doesn't mean you can do the job.

38
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Jan, you always got carried away, even when we were back in college.

39
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,060
Yeah, what do you know about how I feel?

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,860
Inspector Zemon was murdered.

41
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,600
He always treated me like I was his own son.

42
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,880
When I started, I didn't know anything.

43
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,540
But Inspector Zemon was there for me.

44
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,560
That man taught me what it takes to be a real detective.

45
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,880
I respected him, you know,

46
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,940
for caring enough to help out a guy like me who needed a hand.

47
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,580
I will avenge his senseless death if it's the last thing I do!

48
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,240
I swear I'll track down his killer and I will make him pay!

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,260
Okay, well, uh...

50
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,660
We have a staff meeting early tomorrow morning, Yan.

51
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,740
Hey, what kind of friends are you? It's still early.

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,460
I'm fighting for justice to protect both of you.

53
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,800
So come on, support your local police and let's have another round.

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,980
Just one more, what do you say, huh?

55
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,660
Hey, cut it out, crime fighter.

56
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:56,420
You know, we're out there working for justice, and to get murdered, that's so sad.

57
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,400
That's a hell of a role-board.

58
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,420
Huh?

59
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,300
Hey Yan, what are you looking at?

60
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,820
It's her. It's that girl from the grocery store.

61
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,360
Huh?

62
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,980
I've seen that girl twice when I went to the supermarket.

63
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,380
It was after working night duty.

64
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,740
That's her.

65
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,440
I really wanted to introduce myself to her then, but I didn't.

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,140
Looks like I've got another chance.

67
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,300
Hey, Yan, don't even try it.

68
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,780
She's way too pretty to go for a guy like you. Seriously.

69
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,780
Uh, hello.

70
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,620
Hi there.

71
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,860
You don't happen to remember me from the supermarket.

72
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,620
No, I guess you don't. I've wanted to talk to you for a while.

73
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,540
Oh, my name's Yansuke, and I'm not some random barfly.

74
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,300
I may not look it, but I'm a policeman.

75
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,780
Actually, I'm a detective, but don't be scared of me.

76
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,340
I'm off duty now. I just wanted to meet you.

77
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,540
Man, I don't think she's even said a word to him.

78
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,320
Yeah, he's striking out. You better go give him a hand.

79
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,660
Sorry for butting in.

80
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,380
Our friend here is feeling pretty depressed. Any chance you could talk to him for a bit?

81
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,160
Something terrible happened to the superior of his. He's all broken up.

82
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,960
Oh yeah, he's been pretty depressed.

83
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,880
Come on! I haven't acted depressed at all!

84
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,960
I never met a person as kind as he was.

85
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,000
Inspector Zemon was an inspiration to me.

86
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,700
His murderer took that great man away from us.

87
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,760
I know I'll find a way to bring him to justice.

88
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,800
Oh, wow. Here I am doing all the talking. Sorry.

89
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,020
You're passionate about what you believe.

90
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,440
You've got to try your best to catch his killer.

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,260
Oh, I can't believe this.

92
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,940
I finally get the chance to talk to you,

93
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
and I haven't even asked you about yourself yet.

94
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,880
So, uh, what's your name?

95
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,520
- I wish I knew my real name, but I don't.

96
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,500
- What?

97
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,320
Well, maybe I can help you.

98
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, I'll figure out who you are.

99
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,100
IDing people is part of my job.

100
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,820
Maybe I can guess your name.

101
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,840
After all, I am a detective now.

102
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,360
I'm betting your name is...

103
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,480
- I told you I don't even know my name,

104
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,540
so there's no way you can guess it.

105
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll tell you two things I know about myself.

106
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,800
Chidok Bridge, and Three Frogs.

107
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,280
And that's all I know.

108
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,320
Hold on!

109
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,900
Hey, wait!

110
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,460
Wait a second!

111
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,740
When can I see--

112
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,080
What did we tell you?

113
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,800
You blew it.

114
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,000
Next time, try picking one that's not so pretty.

115
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,080
All right, we've identified the two men

116
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,380
murdered at the same time as Inspector Zemon.

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,360
Victim number one is Chestmere Murat.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,360
is Yakov Suhacek.

119
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,040
Turns out they were both sergeants

120
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,580
in the Czech secret police.

121
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,500
After the fall of socialism, they went underground

122
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,840
and started getting up to all sorts of no good.

123
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,200
After analyzing blood at the crime scene, we found something.

124
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,880
Besides Zeman, Marat, and Suhacek,

125
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,500
we IDed someone else's blood at the murder scene,

126
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,380
someone with blood type ABRH positive.

127
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,780
Judging from the amount of blood we found,

128
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,240
we know they were seriously injured.

129
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,740
At present, we're trying to actively determine

130
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,220
Detective Souk? Souk, wake up!

131
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,880
Yes, sir!

132
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,920
What on earth were you just daydreaming about?

133
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,760
We have lost a brilliant officer, Inspector Zemon!

134
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,080
We're facing a dire situation, and you're daydreaming here?

135
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,000
I... I'm very sorry, sir.

136
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,320
Anyhow, according to a witness,

137
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,760
there was a man seen walking away from the murder scene

138
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,280
at a time we feel was immediately after the crime.

139
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,760
He is described as a tall, thin man in his forties

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,800
Now, I want all of you to get out there and track that guy down!

141
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,740
Oh, well...

142
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,260
That girl... Guess she won't be back.

143
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,260
Mr. Detective...

144
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,100
Did you find your friend's killer? Have any luck?

145
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,040
Not yet.

146
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,160
It takes time, but I did get more information that might help.

147
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,820
The inspector, he was investigating a murder case just before he died.

148
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,500
Tell me more.

149
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,420
This old man, he was running his own illegal orphanage.

150
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,740
Somebody shot both him and his maid.

151
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,980
All morning, Zemon was busy questioning the man who discovered that crime scene.

152
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,700
Who was he?

153
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,420
Huh?

154
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,680
You know, who was the man who found the bodies?

155
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,300
He seemed nice. He was a tall, skinny-looking guy.

156
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,140
He was visiting from out of town.

157
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,360
He had this big, heavy duffel bag.

158
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,820
A tall, thin man.

159
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,900
And he was carrying a big duffel bag.

160
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,880
Could it be?

161
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,780
That man being questioned, do you know where he is?

162
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,700
Yeah, I think I do know.

163
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,200
I'll call the station and check.

164
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,140
C'mon, pick up.

165
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,400
Huh?

166
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,920
You go get him, Mr. Detective.

167
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,320
Hi, it's Sook here.

168
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,280
C'mon, not again!

169
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
Yeah, I'm here.

170
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,060
Chedak Bridge... and Three Frogs...

171
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,220
Wait, Chedak Bridge... That's over in Mikalska.

172
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,780
I need to find those Three Frogs.

173
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,920
(panting)

174
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,580
There they are.

175
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,380
If I come here, I bet I'll see her again.

176
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,020
(clears throat)

177
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,680
(whooshing)

178
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,760
- He checked out?

179
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,380
Well, when?

180
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,980
- Let's see, Mr. Grimmer, Mr. Grimmer.

181
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,580
Ah, it says here Mr. Grimmer checked out

182
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,200
the day before yesterday in the morning.

183
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,680
- There's no doubt.

184
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,000
I know exactly who murdered the inspector.

185
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,960
It was Grimmer, he slept here in this room.

186
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,760
Damn, why couldn't I have figured

187
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,140
this whole thing out two days ago?

188
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,940
Don't worry, Inspector. I'll still catch that bastard.

189
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,400
I swear.

190
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,460
Hey!

191
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,420
My word! Detective Suk, what are you doing here?

192
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,380
Chief Detective Patella, I could ask you the same, sir.

193
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,780
I see.

194
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,440
Well, using your wits, you progressed this far all by yourself. That's impressive.

195
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,640
Thank you.

196
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,980
And sir, I knew I'd be the first.

197
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,020
To make a breakthrough in this case, I just knew I would.

198
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,200
And I won't stop doing all I can to make sure that cop killer is apprehended.

199
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,040
Yeah, you've really pulled things together here. Great job.

200
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,820
Thanks, Chief.

201
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,280
Now, I'm ordering you to do me a favor here and keep this whole thing top secret.

202
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,420
Huh?

203
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,260
But Grimmer killed them! All the clues lead to that conclusion!

204
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,040
We can't just let him go-

205
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,240
Just hold on, Detective.

206
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,700
This case is a little more complicated than you think it is.

207
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,200
What?

208
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,140
Inspector Zemon had been assigned to a special investigation.

209
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,760
It was top secret.

210
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,560
Wait, the inspector was working undercover?

211
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,580
Right. He was investigating former Czechoslovakian secret police agents.

212
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,000
Some of them had faked their records and were working as officers on the Prague police force.

213
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,780
Inspector Zemon was working with members of the Czech secret police?

214
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,960
You know those two corpses we found with Zemon?

215
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,900
Both of them were formerly Czech secret police.

216
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,980
And aside from myself and the chief, almost no one knows about this.

217
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,940
Don't stick your nose in too deep. You could get yourself killed.

218
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,600
Not a word to anyone about this. Got it?

219
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,540
Sir, what should I be doing regarding this case?

220
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,180
Whoa, just slow down.

221
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,020
Grimmer might come back to this hotel at any moment, so you need to be here.

222
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,140
Keep your eyes peeled.

223
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,340
By the way, Suke, you happen to find yourself a girlfriend yet?

224
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,000
At the briefing, as you sat there, you had this smitten look.

225
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,920
C'mon, who's the lucky girl?

226
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,460
Uh, she's not really my girlfriend, sir.

227
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,000
She just hangs out at this bar where I usually go.

228
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,960
She a pretty girl?

229
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,460
Oh, yeah. She's very pretty.

230
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,140
Well, in that case, introduce me to her.

231
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,680
What's the name of that bar now?

232
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,120
I wouldn't call it a bar.

233
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,780
I don't feel right about doing that, sir.

234
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,800
But didn't you just tell me she's not your girlfriend?

235
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,140
Well, I suppose that's true, but...

236
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,360
Suk sends his regards, honey.

237
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,380
Well, hey, he wasn't kidding. You really are a beauty.

238
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,640
Who are you?

239
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,280
Glad you asked. I'm one of Suk's bosses.

240
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,860
But tell us my name we were talking and he said that there's a real beauty that he meets here

241
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,760
He couldn't come tonight. He's stuck doing a stakeout. How about I buy you a drink?

242
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:30,280
Hey, come on, honey, don't leave why not just one little drink

243
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,240
Hey there, Suk.

244
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,980
Oh, Detective Janacek, it's you.

245
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,840
Good morning, sir.

246
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,860
Vitella and I had a little chat.

247
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,960
He met that girl you're going after.

248
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,860
Said she's a real knockout.

249
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,760
Uh, sir, you went to that bar I talked to you about?

250
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,660
Oh, yeah.

251
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,240
But, you didn't do anything to her, did you, sir?

252
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,480
Please, say you didn't.

253
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,180
Ah, now, come on, Suk.

254
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,980
Don't get so excited, my boy.

255
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,300
Yeah, but everyone at the station knows that Chief Patella here really has a way with women.

256
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,580
Relax. She gave me that cold shoulder pretty quick.

257
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,560
That gal of yours must be a pretty tough cookie.

258
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,440
Most girls fall for him in a heartbeat. It's true.

259
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,040
She's a nice girl.

260
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,380
I... I mean, she's a good listener and interesting to talk to.

261
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,060
It's fun just to be around her. She's cool.

262
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,920
You're not talking to me, are you?

263
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,340
Anyways, Chief Farabek wants you to meet him right now in Inspector Zemon's office.

264
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,900
Oh, uh, yes sir.

265
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,060
Oh yeah, that reminds me.

266
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,820
Someone gave me these. Want a whiskey bon-bon?

267
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,400
Nope, I'm off candy.

268
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,420
Fine. Hey Sook, you want a bon-bon?

269
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
Uh, no thank you sir, I'm okay.

270
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,940
Hey, hold on a second.

271
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,420
Yes sir?

272
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,300
Don't say a word to the chief about our tall, thin suspect.

273
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,560
Right.

274
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,000
Poor Zemon. What a way to go.

275
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,940
Looks like his desk has pretty much been cleaned out.

276
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,480
All that's left are these two boxes of his personal stuff.

277
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,180
See to it that his widow gets it.

278
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,180
It looks like a key for a gym locker.

279
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,960
God, that smells!

280
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,300
Nothing in here but sweaty shirts, stinky socks and moldy towels.

281
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,900
A notebook?

282
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,520
Look. What the heck is this?

283
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,940
It's got detailed personnel files of everyone that's on the force.

284
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,220
Oh, wow. It's even got my whole record in here.

285
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,040
Inspector Zayman had been assigned to a special investigation.

286
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,540
It was top secret.

287
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,140
Right, he was investigating former Czechoslovakian secret police agents.

288
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,400
Some of them had faked their records and were working as officers on the Prague Police Force.

289
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,760
Wait, there's something missing.

290
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,640
Two files aren't in here.

291
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,740
Chief Detective Patella's and Detective Janicek's.

292
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,100
(suspenseful music)

293
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,980
- You're right, Detective.

294
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,780
This is a suspiciously large amount of cash.

295
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,160
- That's why I brought it here, Chief.

296
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:00,840
- Hmm.

297
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,100
So, tell me, Sook.

298
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,640
What do you surmise about Inspector Zaymon

299
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,020
from these things that you found?

300
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,640
It appears that Inspector Zemon was conducting an internal investigation.

301
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,280
Mm-hmm.

302
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,680
And, as a result,

303
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,680
he discovered that Detectives Patella and Janicek

304
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:23,240
worked previously in the old regime as agents for the Czechoslovakian secret police.

305
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,540
Mm-hmm.

306
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:25,980
I think,

307
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,020
and it makes me sad to say this, sir,

308
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,640
the inspector must have taken all that cash as hush money

309
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,680
in return for keeping quiet about the truth.

310
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,060
The implications of this evidence are serious.

311
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,000
I know. I feel sick just saying it.

312
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Detective Suk.

313
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,580
Yes, sir.

314
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,700
You need to keep this matter completely to yourself.

315
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,680
Yes, sir.

316
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
We'll talk again later.

317
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,040
Now return to your regular duties.

318
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,020
Yes, sir!

319
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,420
I never thought this would happen.

320
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,080
Yeah, things have become complicated.

321
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,080
We were plain stupid to do what we did.

322
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,420
Why'd we take a guy like Sook so lightly?

323
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,480
And we haven't even settled the matter with this guy Grimmer that killed Zaymon.

324
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,620
And now there's an even bigger issue that we have to face.

325
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,240
So then do we offer the rookie money, like we did with Zaymon?

326
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,300
If that doesn't work, the only option is, you know...

327
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,540
Whatever it takes.

328
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,080
for allowing former secret police into the force.

329
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,760
From here on, we've got to keep a tighter lid on all of this.

330
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,880
Once Sook's gone, things will be as smooth as silk.

331
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,220
My head.

332
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,920
I sure could go for a nice drink right about now.

333
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,600
How about a whiskey bonbon instead?

334
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,900
Hey, they're better than nothing.

335
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,940
Besides, these were a gift from a real beauty.

336
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,480
Here, Chief.

337
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,120
(chewing)

338
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,140
- What's wrong?

339
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,820
You look depressed.

340
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,460
- I feel like I can't believe in anything anymore.

341
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,900
- Why do you say that?

342
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,540
What's wrong?

343
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,380
I'll help you if you want me to.

344
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,920
- I believed in him.

345
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,700
I never would have thought that Inspector Zemon

346
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,640
could do such a thing.

347
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,880
What happened?

348
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,520
I believed in him.

349
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,860
Right now, the only person who I really believe in...

350
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,580
