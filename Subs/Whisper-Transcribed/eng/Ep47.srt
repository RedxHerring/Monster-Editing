1
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,340
Hello, Anna.

2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,800
The wind's getting cold, isn't it?

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,840
Hmm?

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,460
That's strange.

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,860
She always smiles at me and says hello.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,660
Oh, Anna!

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,700
Are you headed home for the evening?

8
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,600
[panting]

9
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,200
Hey, Nina!

10
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,160
Looks like all the restaurants in this neighborhood are already closed.

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,640
Let's go back to the hotel, Nina.

12
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,320
What's wrong, huh?

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,320
For some reason, people on this street talk to me like they know me.

14
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,460
But they called me "Ana" instead of "Nina".

15
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,420
[silence]

16
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,940
[music]

17
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,520
Interesting.

18
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
So, what's wrong with this picture?

19
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,800
I'd say a lot.

20
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,100
Suk is the main suspect in a multiple homicide case.

21
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,840
I don't see any police or security anywhere.

22
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,420
Yeah.

23
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,940
I'm gonna go in there and take a look around.

24
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,040
Sure, but I think I'd better tag along. I could use some answers myself.

25
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,040
It's quiet as a tomb. And there's not a single policeman in sight.

26
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,820
Excuse me. There's an injured man being hospitalized here. Suk is his last name?

27
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,500
Huh?

28
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,020
Yon Suk. He's a police detective.

29
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,200
A cop?

30
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,640
All these men were injured at this vacant building on Bruno Street.

31
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,440
Oh, he was one of those unemployed men who were injured in the fight?

32
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,580
Unemployed men? Fight?

33
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,460
That's them.

34
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,500
Who knows what story they're reporting on the news, but what you're saying is probably the real deal.

35
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,960
So, could you please tell us what rooms they're staying in?

36
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,620
After their serious injuries were treated, they were all moved to another hospital.

37
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
To another hospital?

38
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,360
Where?

39
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,920
I don't know. It says a large ambulance came and loaded up all six of the patients.

40
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,620
That's exactly how many of those goons attacked us. There were six of them.

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,240
What about Souk? Detective Yan Souk, where's he? He's the one that was shot.

42
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,060
According to our records, there weren't any patients brought in with any gunshot wounds.

43
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,420
Wait, is there any record of a patient with the name Yan Souk even being brought in here?

44
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,360
No, not at all.

45
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,280
You have research data and an audio tape from 511 Kinderheim.

46
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,080
The former director of 511 Kinderheim, a man named Pedrov, gave them to me before he died.

47
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,660
He was running this illegal orphanage in Prague.

48
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,860
Those things you have, who exactly would be interested in them?

49
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,380
I don't know for sure, but I've got a hunch.

50
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,940
I'd say the Czech secret police have a keen interest in obtaining any material from 511

51
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,660
Kinderheim.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,580
That said, where are you keeping this data and the tape?

53
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,080
Well, they're not on me.

54
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,260
I've stored them in a secure location.

55
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:23,260
Sook was shot because you possessed something they want, and it probably led to him being kidnapped from here.

56
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,080
What's just as bad is we can only imagine what they'll do to Sook to force that data and tape from my hands.

57
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,040
God, what a mess.

58
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,940
The contents of the tape and the data. What are we talking about here?

59
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,320
The research data was a list of technical terms. It also contained a list of names.

60
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,480
I didn't have the time to examine it closely.

61
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,540
I only listened to part of the tape.

62
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,060
So what was this tape a recording of?

63
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,760
A child talking.

64
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,580
A child?

65
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,140
This young boy was probably drugged, then the interviewer asked him questions.

66
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,320
And when this boy was asked his name, his answer was "Johan."

67
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,020
Hm?

68
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Dr. Tenma, is something the matter?

69
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,960
511 Kinderheim.

70
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,240
And research data.

71
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,960
Y-Yohan...

72
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,240
Where is that tape right now?!

73
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,100
It might be best if you come with me.

74
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,200
Tell us where Suk is.

75
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,000
We can discuss that after our business.

76
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,160
Where's Suk?

77
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,020
Would the both of you come with me, please?

78
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,300
Dr. Tenma, you really should have stayed behind.

79
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,400
No. I also have a couple questions that the Czech secret police might be able to answer for me.

80
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,840
So you're saying you have your own agenda, huh?

81
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,420
Well, the first question that needs answering here is whether we can negotiate with these people at all.

82
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,740
Hold on. You didn't drive us all this way to treat us to dinner, did you?

83
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,820
Welcome, gentlemen. Come, have a seat.

84
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,480
I know that face.

85
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,700
He looks familiar. He must be a high-ranking member of the Czech secret police.

86
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,720
You're right. He's Captain Karol Lanka. I did research on him at the newspaper.

87
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,380
Now we're getting somewhere.

88
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,660
"First, I want to express to you my sincerest apology for what happened.

89
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,040
The men I assigned to this have taken actions that were far too heavy-handed.

90
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,800
This was an error within our chain of command.

91
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,240
We've been awfully misunderstood, by you and the world.

92
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,420
We are viewed as a rogue gang of ruthless killers."

93
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,620
"So where's Sook?"

94
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,380
"Sook is not in any danger.

95
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,380
He is resting comfortably at one of our hospitals."

96
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,800
I don't want you thinking of us as thugs. After all, it's not like we've killed anyone.

97
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,780
What about the woman?

98
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,120
What woman?

99
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,040
Wasn't that blonde woman who killed Pedrov acting on direct orders from you?

100
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,700
I've heard about this woman's murderous activities, but she isn't working for us.

101
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,700
In fact, she's been quite disruptive to our plans.

102
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,200
We are not in the business of killing people.

103
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,500
A German associate of ours informed us that he wanted the tape and the data,

104
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:40,060
And we were delicately negotiating securing them from Pedrov in the middle of all this he was murdered

105
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,920
Well, there must have been a lot of money involved. Yes, but that negotiation failed

106
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,220
We are here to discuss business of a more pressing nature

107
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,140
I want that tape and data in trade for the safe return of sook sounds fair

108
00:08:53,140 --> 00:09:02,600
But I don't have those things our sources say you do have what we want. I

109
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,100
I won't.

110
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,140
Who knows what could happen if that information got out into the world for a second time.

111
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,960
We must never allow something like that to happen again.

112
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,180
There's no point in talking about things like that now.

113
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,480
After all, it doesn't really relate to our present discussion.

114
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,380
That's where you're wrong. You see, I'm from there.

115
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,780
I was there.

116
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,000
As a child, I was sent to live at 511 Kinderheim.

117
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,820
I see. How old are you?

118
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,380
Well, when did you leave that place?

119
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,820
I was fourteen years old, as near as I can tell.

120
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,240
And that was thirty years ago.

121
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,680
When were you there?

122
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,120
Who knows? Guess I got there when I was about eight.

123
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,560
So that must have been around 1963.

124
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,940
I guess.

125
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,560
Did you know this boy?

126
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,780
He's my nephew. In the early 1960s, I was officially stationed as an intelligence officer

127
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,100
in East Berlin, where I worked as a spy for the Czechoslovakian embassy. I had a beautiful

128
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,140
younger sister. She married this East German. After being married a few years, my younger

129
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,320
sister and her husband plotted to defect and cross the Berlin Wall. During their attempt

130
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,340
to cross over, they were shot dead.

131
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,580
My nephew was all that was left of their family.

132
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,780
I heard it was a wonderful place,

133
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,540
so I signed him up to live there.

134
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,560
It was touted as an ideal environment

135
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,780
to prepare and educate children with dubious pasts

136
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,120
so they would qualify to become

137
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,740
the communist elite of the future.

138
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,040
I gave it my all.

139
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,080
I used all the influence I had to be sure

140
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,640
that he would get into 511 Kinderheim.

141
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:08,140
"I don't know him. I have no memories. None from that time. Or even before then. I don't

142
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,760
remember what happened there. I was brainwashed. I can't even tell you my real name."

143
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:21,020
"I see. You're trying to make a profit off of something that was reprehensible. You want

144
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,460
to sell information that includes experimental data that was collected from your own nephew!

145
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,720
We've strayed off topic.

146
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,200
You're attacking instead of discussing things in a calm, business-like manner.

147
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,960
Very well then, you may go.

148
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,000
We're done discussing things for today.

149
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,320
"I await your acceptance of my offer.

150
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,960
Take these gentlemen where they wish."

151
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,840
"I can't believe he sent us away.

152
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,960
What do we do?

153
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,140
Saving Suk is what's important.

154
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,920
If we give him what he wants, I think he'd release Suk to us right away."

155
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,060
(door opens)

156
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,180
- You okay?

157
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,860
- Hot cocoa.

158
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:17,820
- Huh?

159
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,780
- I remember.

160
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,800
I remember.

161
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,880
Grimmer, come back!

162
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:31,840
(glass shattering)

163
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,320
Once a week we got cocoa.

164
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,820
He always looked forward to drinking it!

165
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,560
Your nephew was so kind to me!

166
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,820
When I got a fever and slept in the infirmary, he brought me his cocoa.

167
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,600
He gave me his, even though he liked it so much.

168
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,000
It was delicious.

169
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,320
I'd never had cocoa that delicious in my entire life.

170
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,640
And I wanted to thank him in some way for what he'd done for me.

171
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,020
And that's when he said to me,

172
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,020
That's when he looked into my eyes and said, "Remember me."

173
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,560
Back then, while we were there, we all did stuff like that.

174
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,500
We talked about ourselves to the friends we made.

175
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,700
I don't really know why, but our memories about ourselves would fade day by day

176
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,960
after those strange lessons they would put us through.

177
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,800
We could hardly remember our names after a while.

178
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,860
That's why...

179
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,120
That's why...

180
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,020
We had our friends remember who we really were!

181
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,280
He loved hot cocoa drawing pictures and bugs fascinated him

182
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,920
But he didn't like bug collections because he didn't like having to kill the bugs

183
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,480
The most funny ever had was spending a day in the forest with his parents

184
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,420
He caught a lot of butterflies there

185
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:52,540
But then when he went back home, he set the butterflies free his lifelong dream was to become an entomologist his name was

186
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,920
His name was his name was Adolf Reinhardt

187
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,380
That boy was my nephew.

188
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,600
Welcome home.

189
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,000
Keeping secrets from him is dangerous.

190
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,120
You're definitely a no-no.

191
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,840
People can become...

192
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,660
...whatever they want to be.

193
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,020
A toast!

194
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,340
Hey, welcome home.

195
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,460
Hey, welcome home.

196
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,620
Hey, welcome home.

197
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,640
Hey, Nina, what's wrong?

198
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,680
I... Somehow, I... I know this place.

199
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,340
The brick road leading up to here...

200
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,720
The scenery's familiar...

201
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,340
And even... this old sign...

202
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,320
I know all these things.

203
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,000
You lived here?

204
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,180
I don't know.

205
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,720
But I...

206
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,260
But what?

207
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,200
I'm afraid.

208
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,660
So do you know this door?

209
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,560
I'm not sure.

210
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,060
But I...

211
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,780
Hold on.

212
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,040
I'm so afraid.

213
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,560
(door creaking)

214
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,220
- I also recognize these stairs.

215
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,780
- I couldn't sleep, not after what you said.

216
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,740
I thought about it all night.

217
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,180
(birds chirping)

218
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,240
- But Dr. Tenma, that research data and tape

219
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,500
really shouldn't concern you.

220
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,840
- Actually, they do.

221
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,980
- Looks like we're not gonna have time to talk.

222
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,280
- Huh?

223
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,080
- I guess they're ready to do some more negotiating.

224
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,100
Our Czech secret police have dropped by for a morning chat.

225
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,760
I guess they want an answer.

226
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,580
- So, have you had a chance to think everything through?

227
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,500
- I have, and I don't plan on giving you

228
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,000
the research data or the tape.

229
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,780
- So you're saying that you don't care

230
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,360
what happens to Detective Suk?

231
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,000
- If something happens to Suk,

232
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,640
that precious data and tape

233
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
disappear from this world forever, I guarantee.

234
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,960
- Your attitude keeps us from making progress.

235
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,020
- Hold on.

236
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,940
I am willing to offer you a chance to listen to the tape.

237
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,100
The only condition I have

238
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,520
is that you forget this whole business

239
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,860
about getting your hands on it

240
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,700
that German friend of yours.

241
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,760
I'm fine with meeting you somewhere

242
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,340
and letting you hear the tape in private

243
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,100
if you want to listen to it by yourself.

244
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,720
I think that you should want to listen to it.

245
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,320
I think you should hear it for your nephew

246
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,520
who lived in 511 Kinderheim.

247
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,980
You should listen closely to what exactly

248
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,380
that boy Johan said on your precious tape.

249
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
- So that's the deal you're willing to make?

250
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
- I didn't say anything about making a deal.

251
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,380
- That's enough!

252
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,100
We don't have time to be going on and on like this.

253
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,160
As we sit here discussing the finer points of some deal,

254
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,680
an innocent person could be killed because of that tape!

255
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,700
Tell me, how many people that were somehow involved with the Czechoslovakian secret police

256
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,580
have been killed because of that connection?

257
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,900
And just who do you think killed them? Any idea?

258
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,600
I know exactly who this relentless killer is.

259
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,900
It's a person who wants the tape more than anyone.

260
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,760
It's Johan!

261
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,200
What are you trying to say?

262
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,740
I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.

263
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,340
Don't you play dumb with me.

264
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,740
Your German friend who wants you to track it down

265
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,660
should have told you what kind of tape it is.

266
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,140
So what is he hoping you're going to find?

267
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,680
The monster's identity. That was all.

268
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,980
I didn't want to get you involved.

269
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,320
But now I'll tell you everything

270
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,220
before anyone else is murdered over this.

271
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,020
I see. So this killer, Johan, has come to Prague searching for his origins to uncover

272
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,720
his past.

273
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:13,420
That could be. Johan could be here trying to erase his past completely. You created

274
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,840
this mess. What the hell did you do 15 years ago? Back then a mother and her daughter lived

275
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,580
in Mokulski near Chedock Bridge.

276
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,800
Then one day, both of them were taken away

277
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,140
by your secret police.

278
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,280
When your thugs took Johan from the building

279
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,700
with a sign that has three frogs,

280
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,800
what did you do to him?

281
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,300
- These stairs.

282
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,340
Big brother!

283
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,520
- Are you okay, Mina?

284
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,220
- He was taken and dragged down these very steps.

285
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,140
They took him away.

286
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,320
- Who was?

287
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
My big brother...

288
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,520
During that time, I was indeed in a position where I could get any of the information I wanted.

289
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,980
But the Three Frogs building, grabbing a mother and a child...

290
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,740
I don't recall any of that.

291
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,020
Don't give me that!

292
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,000
As high-ranking as I was, there were some things even I didn't know about.

293
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,100
Like the things that man did.

294
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,640
We didn't even know which branch of the secret police he belonged to.

295
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,080
Why we couldn't even figure out whose chain of command he was supposedly following.

296
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:27,100
He was given free reign and detained as many people as he cared to, for no real reason, and never had to report it.

297
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,640
We all wondered to ourselves, "How can he do that?"

298
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,500
He was only the rank of captain, but unbelievably, his office was somehow headquartered in a luxurious mansion.

299
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,100
Ah, yes. He was called "The Man of Red Rose Mansion," I believe.

300
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,780
Are you saying that this captain was involved?

301
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,440
He was a very elegant, quiet man who kept to himself.

302
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,260
He never wore a uniform, and he loved having tea and cake.

303
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,160
What was his real name?

304
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,920
It was Franz Bonaparta.

305
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,820
I see. Bonaparta.

306
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,100
However, I'm not certain if that was his actual name.

307
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,880
Bonaparta was also known to have a pseudonym.

308
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,760
Why would he need one?

309
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,820
Well, you see, he was also the author of a children's book.

310
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,780
Are you afraid of this door?

311
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,520
I... I... I was reading a picture book in here.

312
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,300
Then the door opened. Someone came back home.

313
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,660
Children's book.

314
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,440
That's right. It was a strange picture book.

315
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,760
It was called "The Nameless Monster."

316
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,360
There's nothing in here. Nina...

317
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,340
This memory is real. I've been here before.

318
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,960
I was reading a picture book, sitting here by myself.

319
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,660
But the one who opened the door and came back...

320
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,380
was me.

321
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,840
How could that be?

322
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,420
I was greeting myself.

323
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,400
Welcome home.
