1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,240
Did you get the reception guest list?

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,960
Yes, it's right here. We've been going over it.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,260
We've got a pretty good handle on who was there and their vantage point at the time of the incident.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,760
So isn't it most likely that this guy was targeting the governor?

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,480
The guests were all VIPs. I'll bet all of them have enemies.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,640
Well, keep checking around for any connections he may have with any of the guests.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,100
The people here at Frankfurt Station are certainly abuzz over the convention center shooting. Very busy.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,360
Although we've identified the attacker, we still don't know who he was aiming for when he pulled the trigger.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, you were able to nail down his identity.

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,480
Yes. He was a dentist living in the redevelopment area.

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,720
A dentist? Damn, I don't like to hear that.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,020
Why is that, sir?

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,680
Well, I've been so busy every day that I never seem to find the time to see one.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,060
So I was thinking of going to a dentist and having some work done as soon as I retire.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,580
But a gun-toting dentist kind of gives me the creeps.

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,840
As you can see, I'm Inspector Visbon, North Rhine-Westphalen Police Department.

17
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,900
Reinhard Dinger, age 42, taxi driver by profession, arrested in Frankfurt, suspected of killing

18
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,600
a passenger in Gunther Forrest Park, as well as the murder of Bilker Investment Bank employee

19
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,940
in '97, the '96 Hoffgarten murder, the '95 Rhine-Riverside murder, the Hilden

20
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,180
Dinger is wanted for all these murders which occurred around the Dusseldorf area.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,480
I now affirm that the suspect is being transferred to the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen.

22
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,880
Is everybody ready to move him?

23
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,740
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,140
Come on.

25
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,440
All right, let's go.

26
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,200
Want a drink?

27
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,840
No, I'm good.

28
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,160
Smoking's not allowed.

29
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,840
There's a sign in this car that says smoking is prohibited.

30
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,720
Oh, you're right.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,960
If only you had stuck to your morals that well instead of going around killing people.

32
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,440
You have any idea how many you've killed with those hands?

33
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,620
Watching you count irreplaceable lives on your fingers, I know the dead won't rest in peace.

34
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,260
I'm happy to say this will be my last assignment.

35
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm retiring tomorrow.

36
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
It wasn't an impressive career.

37
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,200
Not stellar, but not bad if I do say so.

38
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Now I can tend to my garden and relax and just enjoy being with my wife.

39
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,900
That's what life is really all about.

40
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,700
I want you to realize what wonderful moments you took from all those lives that you crushed. I want you to regret it

41
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,600
Even when a man spits on me you want me to regret it what?

42
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,540
Some man I picked up on Adler Street spat right on me when he was getting out of my cab

43
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,140
You mean you killed him just for that?

44
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,340
Spitting on another human being should be a crime. I mean is there any worse insult

45
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,220
The couple I picked up at Gerasheim Station were a whole lot worse.

46
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,880
They started having sex right there in the backseat of my cab.

47
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,460
In the backseat of my own taxi cab.

48
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,280
They asked for it, so I killed them both.

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,600
And a drunk teenager who had a really foul mouth on him.

50
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,500
A prostitute who tried to pay her fare with her body until I stopped her.

51
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,700
An old lady with smeared makeup who kept insulting everybody she saw.

52
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,260
All kinds of people took a ride in my taxi cab.

53
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,960
They were all just a lousy bunch of scum.

54
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,820
That's why I killed them.

55
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,400
- Well then, let me ask you a question.

56
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,700
What was it about that Bilker Investment Bank employee

57
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,420
that you murdered?

58
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,780
Exactly how was he scum?

59
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,640
An upstanding citizen who worked hard

60
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,020
and never smoked or drank

61
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,940
and loved his family with all his heart.

62
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:13,680
However, because you killed him, a certain corporate finance scandal that he was going to blow the whistle on remains an unsolved mystery

63
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,620
Ah, that one. It did leave a bad aftertaste

64
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:27,660
Look at you. You talk as if you're delivering holy retribution when you're really just trying to justify your actions

65
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,540
Well, that time, I didn't have a choice

66
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,520
Why? Did somebody force you to do it?

67
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,180
I can't tell you that, Inspector.

68
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,680
I told you, you can't smoke in here.

69
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,940
If you put another of those filthy cigarettes in your mouth, I swear I'll kill you.

70
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,220
Tell me something if you can. What made you turn out this way?

71
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,480
I've always been a righteous thinker. Things have to be correct.

72
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,880
I just got a little push on the back and that's all it took.

73
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,140
That morning, a man was walking his dog in the park when I came along.

74
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,920
The guy started kicking the dog, just for taking a crap.

75
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,920
The dog was whining as he kicked it.

76
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,560
All it had done was heed the call of nature.

77
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,840
So I made him stop.

78
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,760
The next thing I knew, the police were pulling me off of him.

79
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,720
Right at that moment, a boy appeared.

80
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,860
He watched, and then he suddenly spoke to the officers.

81
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,520
He told them it wasn't my fault.

82
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,920
He said the man with the dog had started the whole thing by attacking me in the first place.

83
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,640
He saved me from getting arrested.

84
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,900
I thanked the boy and offered to drive him home, but he said he had no home to go to.

85
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,220
It was odd, but I thought, "Okay."

86
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,380
Then he brought out his sister from the bushes in the corner of the park.

87
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,780
His twin sister.

88
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,900
I'm figuring I have no choice.

89
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,900
So I took them both back home with me to my apartment.

90
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,760
Here's the strange thing.

91
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,000
When they arrived, they took off their jackets and were wearing pajamas.

92
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,380
It was as if they had escaped from a hospital or something.

93
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,220
I figured they'd come from a hospital though, because the boy had a bandage around his head.

94
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,180
After we ate dinner that night, we watched the news.

95
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,100
I muttered to myself, as I usually do about stuff going on in the world,

96
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,720
"What depraved people there are. What a depraved world.

97
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,700
The bastards should die!"

98
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,320
And what do you think the boy said to me right after I muttered that?

99
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,220
He told me I was absolutely right.

100
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,960
And you won't believe what he said to me after that.

101
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,500
We don't need people like that.

102
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,280
That's the moment when I was totally liberated.

103
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,780
That's completely insane!

104
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,860
You mean to say that's when you started killing all those people?

105
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,280
- Well, that's it, Inspector. - Yep.

106
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,980
Your last job has been completed without any incident.

107
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,320
Yeah, and all I gotta do now is clear out my desk.

108
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,280
Thank you for the years of work you've put into the force, sir.

109
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,780
I feel a little frustrated, though.

110
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,020
There were still a couple of unsolved cases left.

111
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Uh, what is it, Inspector Vizba?

112
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,180
Then he brought out his sister, his twin sister.

113
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,160
Both were wearing pajamas, as if they'd just escaped from the hospital.

114
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,540
Don't you remember anything about that night?

115
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,880
Could be anything.

116
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,280
Anything at all that you can recall.

117
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,160
Anything?

118
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:45,640
Hmm?

119
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,800
You know your name, don't you?

120
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,860
Isn't that right?

121
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
I figured they'd come from a hospital, though,

122
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,120
because the boy had a bandage around his head.

123
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,640
The twins! The boy and the girl!

124
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,920
They're gone, sir! We can't find them anywhere!

125
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,520
Uh, Inspector?

126
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,680
Huh?

127
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,840
You want to know how long ago it was when I met the twins?

128
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,140
Let's see...

129
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,600
About eleven years ago.

130
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,260
Can you describe them?

131
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,380
Think now, what did that little boy and girl look like?

132
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,480
They were very good-looking kids.

133
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,200
Yeah, pretty blonde twins.

134
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,080
God, I can't believe it.

135
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,260
The twins who disappeared that day.

136
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,820
The twins who hold a very important key to Dr. Tenma's case.

137
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,760
I'll be damned.

138
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,100
Only thirty hours left until my retirement.

139
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,980
A vampire.

140
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,960
I see.

141
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,720
So that's why you had to drink the blood of those thirteen people, in order to live.

142
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,660
Not just anybody, virgins.

143
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:18,740
I understand. So, let me ask you a question. Three months back, you killed someone. A girl from a general store in Frankfurt.

144
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,800
Her name was Frieda Schilling. Did you drink her blood, too?

145
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:31,740
Now, as you yourself have said, all of the people you've attacked up until this time have been teenage girls.

146
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,880
And you waited until you had researched their behavioral patterns for quite a while before assaulting them.

147
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,680
I understand that they had to be young because you need virgin blood in order to stay alive.

148
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,700
But this victim, Frieda Schilling, wasn't a teenager.

149
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,500
She was twenty-one, although she appeared to be much younger, as though she were in

150
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:50,980
her teens.

151
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,020
However, that's not really the problem here.

152
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,660
Frieda Schilling had worked at a cafe on Zeiler Street in Frankfurt since she was sixteen.

153
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,960
It was very close to a famous school, and the boys who attended that school were very

154
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:15,120
goddess. No surprise then, she gave birth to a baby at the age of 17. According to

155
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,840
various rumors, the father was a student from that famous school. Shortly after

156
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,460
the baby was born, her parents opened a general store. The family of the boy who

157
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,060
got her pregnant was very rich. With the money they received from them, her

158
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,640
parents were able to start the new shop. You knew that, didn't you? Since you did

159
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,220
thorough research into the other cases, I'm sure you also did it for this one.

160
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,000
Do you also drink the blood of girls who aren't virgins?

161
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,100
That one left a real bad aftertaste.

162
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,020
So why is it that you went after her?

163
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,500
I met someone.

164
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,960
He's the real thing.

165
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,740
What are you talking about?

166
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,140
I knew as soon as I met him.

167
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,840
I knew right then that I was nothing more than a mere blood-sucking bat who was just trying to be what he already was.

168
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,200
But he was a real vampire, no doubt about it.

169
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,360
So you're saying that was the man who asked you to do it? Who was it?

170
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,320
Where did you and this guy meet?

171
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:24,860
At a park outside of Frankfurt, in the suburb of Griesheim. It was a park just like any other one, nothing special about it.

172
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,680
There was a sandbox in that park. He wrote her name in the sand with a tree branch.

173
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,220
So then, I just knew who I was supposed to kill.

174
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,420
Do you know who this guy was?

175
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Like I said, he was a genuine vampire.

176
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,520
It's strange when you think about it, isn't it?

177
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,040
Your murder of Erich Klemperer four months ago was all the way over in Frankfurt, when

178
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,340
all of your other missions were in Niedersachsen.

179
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,700
So why did you go to Frankfurt for this one?

180
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,560
a signal from the aliens this time as well?

181
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,380
Did they tell you they changed their minds and that you had to go kill someone in Frankfurt

182
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,320
rather than your usual area?

183
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,060
Or was there perhaps another reason behind your decision?

184
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,840
Klemperer certainly had a sordid history, that's for sure.

185
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,220
He escaped from East Berlin during the Cold War and managed to do well in the food commerce

186
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,380
business over the past several years.

187
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,620
persistent rumors that he smuggled young children over the east-west border as well.

188
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,920
In other words, he took children from the east side and sold them to childless couples

189
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,040
on the west who had the wealth to buy them.

190
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,620
I didn't get a message from the aliens. I met one in person.

191
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,120
It was very moving. An alien was standing directly in front of me, face to face.

192
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,340
Where exactly did the UFO land?

193
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,020
at a public park in the middle of Griesheim.

194
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,900
He spoke the language of the cosmos,

195
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,960
so to make it easier for me to understand,

196
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,400
he wrote letters in the sand.

197
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,560
I wish you could feel it,

198
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,280
the excitement that I felt so strongly.

199
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,300
So, are you all packed up to go, Inspector Vizba?

200
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:30,920
Yep.

201
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,480
We're all counting down the seconds to your retirement.

202
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,580
Everybody wants to get rid of me so bad, they're doing a countdown, eh?

203
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,540
Exactly.

204
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,660
Tonight we'll celebrate the riddance of a great nuisance by drinking.

205
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,860
Oh, and telling stories about working with you.

206
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,760
Sounds like it might be a rather unpleasant evening.

207
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,500
[laughs]

208
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,640
Who's that fellow?

209
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,760
Oh, him. Dr. Gillen. He's a criminal psychologist.

210
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,640
Apparently he's come here today to interview Reinhard Dinger, your serial murderer taxi driver.

211
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,360
Here at somebody's request?

212
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,680
Don't think so. It seems to be for some paper he's writing.

213
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,320
He's got influence in his field, so he can convince the big shots to give him permission.

214
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,820
And so, when the man got out of your taxi and spat on you, you ran him over.

215
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:27,760
Yeah.

216
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,500
I've said this over and over again during interrogations, that the people I killed were

217
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,120
all unnecessary individuals.

218
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,600
You guys don't get it.

219
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,920
You just can't seem to understand my righteousness.

220
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,060
Righteousness, huh?

221
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,960
Fine, then let me ask you another question.

222
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,940
You've always been pretty forthcoming during interviews, but you seem to have quite a hard

223
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,780
time discussing your murder of Fritz Oberth, the Bilker bank employee.

224
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,960
You have consistently claimed you were in the right as the main justification for committing

225
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,460
every one of the other murders, but that's missing when you try to account for this killing.

226
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,960
You've never given an acceptable reason for why you murdered Oberth.

227
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,580
I don't want to talk to you anymore. I'm done.

228
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,940
Dr. Gillen, how'd it go in there?

229
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,780
My name's Inspector Visbaugh.

230
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,320
Was there anything academically or scientifically interesting that Dinger was able to tell you in his interview?

231
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,280
Nothing. Aside from what he's already said before many times.

232
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,680
Excuse me.

233
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,080
Actually, I want to talk to him again.

234
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,880
There's something I really need to ask him about, face to face.

235
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,120
Today I retire from the force,

236
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,840
but I won't feel right until I get this out of the way first.

237
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,520
What do you think about this academically, hmm?

238
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,140
Suppose there was a monster-like child

239
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,120
who grew up and visited a man who owed him something from the past

240
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,700
You're right. I know it's an absurd story. Sorry I mentioned it.

241
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,840
No, let me hear more about it. I'm very interested.

242
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,500
Now you both want to grill me?

243
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,620
No way. I already said I'm finished talking to Mr. Researcher here.

244
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,120
My final shift hasn't ended yet. I'm still a detective.

245
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,020
This is an interrogation.

246
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,660
And it's regarding those twins I asked you about.

247
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,700
about yesterday you said the boy had liberated you that's when you began your

248
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,580
killing spree I'm just wondering if that little boy grew up and then 11 years

249
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,480
later came back to you and asked you to do something for him no matter what it

250
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,100
was he wanted would you have done it for him

251
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,840
well now I just don't know let me be more specific did you commit the murder

252
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,640
the banker, at the request of someone who asked you to do it.

253
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,860
This was a diligent man, and honest as well.

254
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,480
That's the kind of person Mr. Oberth was.

255
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,240
Quite unlike the scum you so often claim to be eliminating.

256
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,380
And this was the man who was about to blow the lid off of a corporate corruption scandal.

257
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,660
If you call him scum, the moral justification for your crimes is shattered.

258
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,120
"It wasn't a request, Inspector.

259
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,720
He and I didn't even need to speak to each other."

260
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,060
"Who's that?"

261
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,800
"For whatever reason, that bank employee was probably scum to him.

262
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,520
At least, that's what I tell myself."

263
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,500
"Why?"

264
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,780
"Because I think he's right.

265
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,640
That's why."

266
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,680
"And who is he?

267
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,580
Is he one of those grown-up twins?"

268
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,620
"When did you meet him?

269
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,640
And where was it?

270
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,140
In Griesheim, at a little park in the middle of the town.

271
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,700
At a park outside of Frankfurt? In the suburb of Griesheim?

272
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,540
At a public park in the middle of Griesheim.

273
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,780
There was a sandbox for kids and he wrote a name in the sand.

274
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,160
He didn't say anything, but I knew anyway.

275
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,760
He wanted me to kill the man whose name he had written.

276
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:39,540
words. We understood each other. We don't need people like that in this world.

277
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,600
What does it mean? It appears that all three men you interviewed may have killed someone

278
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,680
at the request of the same man. By having three unrelated serial killers perform the

279
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,600
acts, the significance of these murders would be much harder for anyone to spot.

280
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,100
The significance would be harder for anyone to...

281
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,540
What does all of this mean? Fill me in, for God's sake!

282
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,920
Dr. Tenma and Nina are both headed to Frankfurt.

283
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,960
It's Johan!

284
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,100
Unless I miss my guess...

285
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,900
He's definitely trying to start something in Frankfurt.

286
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,640
[MUSIC]

287
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,360
(upbeat music)
