1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,620
So this is Ruhenheim.

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,440
This is it.

3
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,540
(dramatic music)

4
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,380
(barking)

5
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,100
Ludwig! You stop that!

6
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,340
What's got you barking so much?

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,640
(barking)

8
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,100
Looks like that bike of yours broke down again.

9
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,780
Yeah. The chain always comes loose.

10
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,340
My bike was once junkyard trash.

11
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
Guess it'll always be junkyard trash.

12
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,040
Well, in my opinion, your bike doesn't look like trash.

13
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,560
When I'm riding it, the guys say,

14
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,920
"Hey, look, here comes the trash rolling by."

15
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,140
Bunch of trash riding around on trash, they say.

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,060
- Don't listen to them, Vim.

17
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,700
Your bike is a well-built five-speed super cycle.

18
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,180
It just needs a little adjustment again, that's all.

19
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,700
Let's see now.

20
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,160
- Hey, looks like you've got a customer.

21
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:40,900
- Mm-mm.

22
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,120
Oh, he must be that man that called.

23
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,540
Hello. Did you call for a room?

24
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,340
I did. My last name is Lungay.

25
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,820
Welcome, Mr. Lungay. I am the hotel proprietor.

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,100
I was glad to hear that you had a vacancy on such short notice.

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,180
To be honest, we always have rooms available.

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,940
That's because it's still the off-season, right?

29
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,880
In our quaint little town, it's off-season year-round.

30
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,800
The only other guests that are staying here right now are that elderly couple.

31
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,680
The husband's confined to that wheelchair.

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,740
Seems like they've had a rough time on this trip.

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,320
Shall I take your bag, sir?

34
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,760
Oh, thank you kindly, Vin.

35
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,800
He'll be up in room 302.

36
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,340
How's the view from that room?

37
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,240
Well, your room has the best view in the entire hotel, sir.

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,200
I'll leave your bag here on the bureau, sir.

39
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,480
I don't think it looks like trash.

40
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,620
Huh?

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,660
No, it looks like a perfectly good bicycle to me.

42
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,940
You're Inspector Lungay of the BKA? Why would you be visiting our little police station?

43
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,140
I wanted to ask you just how many more officers you have in your force if I were to need backup here.

44
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,920
Well, if you contacted the state police,

45
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,420
they could probably supply us with quite a few officers

46
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,460
in less than an hour.

47
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,120
But I can't imagine that a situation like that

48
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,240
would happen in a little rural town like ours.

49
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,260
Right now, you should be checking up on every person

50
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,880
who's recently come into town.

51
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,620
Huh?

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,220
Do it fast before something terrible happens here.

53
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,540
All right! That's more like it!

54
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,920
Now it's working great!

55
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,480
Now to shift into high gear!

56
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,240
(crashing)

57
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,640
- What's the matter, Trash?

58
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,760
- Mr. Trash Bike is still riding around.

59
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,120
Go back to your crap pile, Trash Boy!

60
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,640
- Stop!

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,820
Hey, stop!

62
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,660
(thudding)

63
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,220
(laughing)

64
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,720
- Nice one.

65
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,200
Are you alright?

66
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,700
Are you here alone? I mean, are you traveling by yourself?

67
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,660
That's right.

68
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,400
Is this for work?

69
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
No, I'm doing this for myself.

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,780
Oh, don't you get lonely traveling by yourself?

71
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,920
No, ma'am. I guess I'm used to it.

72
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,280
I see. Do you have any family?

73
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,300
Yes, I do. I have a daughter and a new grandchild.

74
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,640
Oh, that's great. So you have a grandchild, too.

75
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,960
Grandchildren are such a blessing.

76
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,700
The two of us have a grandson that we're always thinking about.

77
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,620
In fact, I'm writing a postcard to him right this instant.

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,000
Letters are so wonderful.

79
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,800
When you write one, you can say things you could never say in person.

80
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,240
Oh, Mr. Lunge, would you care to write one, too?

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,020
Send a postcard to my grandchild?

82
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,980
I wonder what I would write about.

83
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,680
I'm sure anything would be fine.

84
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,160
What a shame.

85
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,420
If only I could draw well.

86
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,040
Uh, excuse me, sir.

87
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,660
Could I possibly get a room here for tonight?

88
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,120
Yes, sir. Of course.

89
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,500
Glad to hear it.

90
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,260
I was enjoying a relaxing picnic out in the countryside,

91
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,200
but I got lost along the way.

92
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,800
Now that I finally made it here, it's already late.

93
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,140
Sometimes when you're walking, it's hard to plan for these things.

94
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,900
Anyway, I'm really grateful you have a room.

95
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,560
How interesting that nobody on that train wanted to get off at this town.

96
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,700
[FOOTSTEPS]

97
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,820
[GUNSHOT]

98
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:00,860
Hm?

99
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,580
A gunshot?

100
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,180
I didn't hear any gunshots.

101
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,620
Yeah, what we just heard definitely

102
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,940
sounded like a gunshot.

103
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,000
Be serious.

104
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,620
I don't think anyone here even owns a gun.

105
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,780
I'd say the only one who might is that drunk across the way.

106
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,100
It would have been a lot louder if it had

107
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,520
been that close to our place.

108
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,660
That drunk's so out of it, he couldn't hit anything if he tried.

109
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,640
Oh, why'd you say "couldn't hit"?

110
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,140
Stop that talk!

111
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,920
I just lost again because you and your negative attitude jinxed me again!

112
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,440
- Honestly! - Oh, shut up with that!

113
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,380
It's not my fault you lose! Stop playing the lottery!

114
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:45,940
Ludwig!

115
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,700
Ludwig!

116
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,160
Ludwig!

117
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,420
My poor Ludwig isn't anywhere to be found

118
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,100
You, you don't think that it's possible that my Ludwig wasâ€¦

119
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,700
Please calm down, Mrs. Hillman.

120
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,740
I assure you, you're imagining things.

121
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,960
There was no gunshot.

122
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,580
Really.

123
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,480
Why is that poor woman so upset?

124
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Oh, well, you see, Mrs. Hillman's dog Ludwig is gone missing.

125
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,740
Aww.

126
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,680
That would make anyone worry.

127
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,880
I know.

128
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,500
Perhaps we should tell the police.

129
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,640
I've already gone to the stupid police.

130
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,100
But that man's no good.

131
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,540
He makes no sense.

132
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,880
- He may be a policeman, but I can't count on him at all.

133
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,180
That oaf is a policeman who hates dogs.

134
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,920
- Excuse me, but would you like me to go look for your dog?

135
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,100
- Are you sure you don't mind, Mr. Neumeier?

136
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,520
- Of course, since I'm going to be hanging

137
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,140
around town anyway, why not?

138
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,200
- Why sure, of course.

139
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,880
I know what Mrs. Hillman's dog Ludwig looks like.

140
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,840
He's that stupid dog that barks a lot, right?

141
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,880
- It seems he's gone missing.

142
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,580
You haven't seen him, have you?

143
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,400
- Nope, haven't seen him lately.

144
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,320
- Well, thanks anyway.

145
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,640
Oh, by the way, sir,

146
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,260
you haven't noticed any suspicious-looking strangers

147
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,580
showing up around town lately?

148
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,700
- Sure have.

149
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,220
- Yeah?

150
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,680
- I'm looking at one right now.

151
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,980
- A dog?

152
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,280
And you had me thinking you were gonna book a room here.

153
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,920
- Sorry.

154
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,980
I'm already spoken for over at the Hotel Versteck.

155
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,880
- That place has been stealing

156
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,200
everyone else's customers left and right.

157
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,880
- Wait, so you're telling me

158
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,280
really don't have any customers right now?

159
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,980
- No, not a one.

160
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,240
Because of that, it's nice and quiet here.

161
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,460
So if that dog had been barking as much as he usually does,

162
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,040
I definitely would have heard him.

163
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,220
- In other words, you didn't hear any barking today.

164
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,660
- No, I didn't hear a peep out of that mutt.

165
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,000
But here's what I'm thinking.

166
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I did hear something earlier that sounded like a gunshot.

167
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,640
Maybe some weirdo got fed up with that dog

168
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,920
always being so noisy and went and shot it.

169
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,420
(birds chirping)

170
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,640
(footsteps)

171
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,600
- Good afternoon, Mr., what was it?

172
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,580
- It's Lungay, Mr. Neumeier.

173
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,060
- Right, Mr. Lungay.

174
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,020
Where are you headed?

175
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,560
- Actually, I'm out looking for a lost dog.

176
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,380
- I know what that's like.

177
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,580
So tell me, have you found any leads yet?

178
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,840
- Not yet.

179

You really use the numbers in Conrad's birthday?

Wait, but there's no way he'd know that you used his birthday

339
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,620
What? Tell me.

340
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,860
On the way back home,

341
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,820
I stopped at the store to get some cigarettes.

342
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,620
That's when I noticed her.

343
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,200
The girl from the sausage shop gave me this weird look.

344
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,980
That explains what happened to me!

Now I get it!

346

347
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,520
to the alley to throw out the trash.

348

if he heard about us having all that money?

352
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,680
He's desperate.

353
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,780
- Hey, calm down.

354
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,920
The only thing we can do now

355
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,140

(chickens clucking)

359
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,820
Well, there's the vampire's house.

360
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,340
A dead cat?

361
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,720
(footsteps approaching)

362
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,440
- Huh?

363
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,700
Someone's in here.

364
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,540
- From the looks of things around this house,

365
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,680
no one has been here recently.

366
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,580
All of the artwork is unfinished.

367
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,300
Did he stop drawing?

368
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,320
But perhaps he couldn't draw anymore.

369
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,720
Hey, what a surprise! It's Vim!

370
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,320
Mr. Neumeier! Mr. Lunge!

371
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,860
What are you doing so far from town, anyway?

372
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,100
Well, you see, it's my bike.

373
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,960
Some boys told me they took my bike, brought it up here, and dumped it.

374
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,040
I see. Looks like those boys played a trick on you.

375
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,880
I saw your bike hidden in the bushes.

376
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,840
It's at the foot of the mountain path that leads up here.

377
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,360
Huh?

378
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,460
Anyway, it appears that cat was shot with a submachine gun.

379
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,200
Then they're already near town.

380
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,720
They are, and they're close by.

381
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,820
Look at this.

382
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,660
The twins, it's them.

383
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,420
And this one, too.

384
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
Here's another.

385
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,080
And another.

386
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,100
And another.

387
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,140
And another.

388
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,080
And another.

389
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,340
They're about ten years old.

390
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:32,840
Hmm?

391
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,280
When I was in charge of Dr. Tenma's case,

392
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,020
these twins were about ten years old at the time.

393
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,180
These pictures must have been drawn right about then.

394
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,640
How many more drawings of those two are there?

395
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,020
Hundreds. No matter how many times he drew them, he was never satisfied.

396
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,940
Look at how they've grown.

397
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,580
Looks like there's going to be a lot of vines to pull out of the bushes this year.

398
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,480
This could really affect this year's Lingonberry crop.

399
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,680
Hello, I've never seen you around here before.

400
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,820
(eerie music)

401
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,740
[MUSIC]

402
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,180
(gentle music)
