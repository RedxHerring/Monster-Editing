00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:08,480
Dr. Tenma, I don't blame you for saving my brother's life anymore.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,860
You did what you had to do as a doctor.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,460
It wasn't your fault.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,540
Please eat the sandwiches, and get some rest, too.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,140
Please live on, and continue to save as many people as you are able to.

Nina Fortner.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,700
Nina, what are you planning to do?

8
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,240
Are you going to kill your brother a second time?

9
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,840
I did it. I brought him back to life.

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,360
That monster. It was me.

11
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,840
I brought him back to life.

12
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,600
(dramatic music)

13
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,520
There are a lot of blood vessels in this arterial venous malformation.

14
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,820
Cutting all arteries.

15
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,120
And now the veins.

Extraction of the nidus is complete.

17
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,340
That went very well.

18
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,620
Yes, as usual. He's remarkably quick with the clipping.

19
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,050
An amazing operation.

20
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,320
Dr. Tenma, how is it possible that even after a long break,

21
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,160
A genius like you only gets better and better.

22
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,560
It's over.

23
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,700
Never mind. It isn't important.

00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,380
Isn't that wonderful, Kenzo?

27
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,300
It wasn't even about me.

28
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,260
It was all about your father.

29
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:26,300
That may be true, but it's only because you did such a wonderful job last night working as part of father's team

30
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm sure he appreciates all your hard work since you're the one responsible for raising the hospital's reputation

31
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,980
No, I'm the one who should be grateful. I mean after all it is

32
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,960
Thanks to your father that I'm actually able to work here in Germany

33
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,520
Hang in there Kenzo if you stick with father your future is guaranteed

It won't be long before father becomes chairman of the board

35
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,380
You'll become Chief of Surgery, and then Chief Director.

00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,040
Which means I'll be the Director's wife.

- Uh, please, sir, madame is resting at the moment.

43
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,960
- I won't need much of her time.

44
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,600
This shouldn't take long.

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,540
But sir, you really need to make an appointment with madame.

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,520
What's all the racket?

47
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,340
Um, I'm terribly sorry to bother you, madame,

48
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,240
but there's a police officer here.

49
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,440
The police?

50
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,960
Miss Eva Heinemann. It's been a while, hasn't it?

51
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,240
And who are you supposed to be?

52
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,320
I worked on your father's case exactly nine years ago.

53
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm Inspector Lunge of the BKA.

54
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,100
Lunge. Oh, I see. You may leave us, Hulse.

55
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,120
Yes, Madame.

56
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,080
I do remember you all too well.

57
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,880
You were that good-for-nothing detective who couldn't even close my father's case.

58
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,300
So tell me, what on earth do you want from me now?

59
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm quite impressed.

60
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,280
You've been able to maintain this residence exactly the same

61
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Actually, it appears that the decor might have gotten even more extravagant than before.

62
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,720
So then, have you come to see how much money I've made from the inheritance my father left me in all my divorce settlements?

63
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,060
As you can see, detective, I live in absolute comfort.

64
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,540
If you see anything you like, please feel free to take it with you.

65
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,280
As long as I have my liquor by my side, I'm fine.

66
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,180
I've come today because there is something I'd like to show you.

67
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,940
Here, take a look at this necktie.

68
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,920
A necktie?

69
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,300
Does it look familiar?

70
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,420
Perhaps you don't remember.

71
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,040
It's a design from nine years ago.

72
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,280
It has a very simple print, but if you look at it carefully,

73
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,600
it's a wonderful piece with an extremely elaborate weave.

74
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,440
So what? What about it?

75
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,660
it back was quite a task after all it was purchased nine years ago. But luckily this

76
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:53,260
was a limited edition offering specially made for a particular store's higher-end clients.

77
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,980
And your name was on that list, Miss Eva Heinemann.

78
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,020
So what exactly is your point?

79
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,800
You see, I was wondering if you might have purchased this and given it to someone as

80
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,460
a gift. This necktie is a key piece of evidence in another murder case.

81
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,620
Murder?

82
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,580
Who knows?

83
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,600
I've given gifts to so many men,

84
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,420
I couldn't possibly keep track of them all now, could I?

85
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
They're not interested in me anyway.

86
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,460
The only thing they're after is my money.

87
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,160
- Please, try to remember.

88
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,420
- I told you, I don't remember.

89
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,740
These men are all after my money.

90
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,480
There isn't a single person

91
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,660
who truly loves me for who I am.

92
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,780
That's why I always stick it to them when it's time for the divorce settlement.

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,580
I did that to all three of them.

94
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,280
Ha! Damn bastards!

95
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,640
Do you want something, too?

96
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,200
You want something? Just tell me.

97
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,960
But you'll pay a high price for it.

98
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,840
I'll be back, ma'am.

99
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,860
If you remember anything, please give me a call.

100
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,880
Next time you stop by, detective, be sure to bring me something to drink.

101
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,240
(liquid pouring)

102
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,920
Excuse me.

107
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,240
- Ava.

108
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,280
Ava, please, you have to talk to your father for me.

109
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,520
Make him see I haven't done anything wrong.

110
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,360
All I did was operate on an emergency patient

111
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,420
You're the worst, nothing else!

112
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,780
Wait, is that the ring that I gave to you?

113
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,640
Spare me, Kenzo. You're such a fool.

114
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,600
Ava, why?

115
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Dr. Norton, you're looking very handsome this evening.

116
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,060
Oh, thank you.

117
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,800
You're looking especially beautiful tonight yourself, Eva.

118
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,840
Hulse, have my car ready.

119
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,240
Well, Mr. Hess, you're certainly looking better today.

120
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,820
At this rate, I'm guessing you should be able to go home sometime later this week, all right?

121
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,160
Thank you very much, Dr. Tenma. You did a great job.

122
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,900
By the way, my daughter is getting married next month.

123
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,940
Do you think I'll be able to attend her wedding?

124
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,560
Yes, that should be fine.

125
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,000
You just have to promise me that you won't get too wild at the reception.

126
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,620
Thanks, Doctor. I had resigned myself to not going, but thanks to you...

127
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,580
you toughed it out. With you looking after me, I feel as though I'll even live to see

128
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:52,580
my grandchildren get married. You truly are a wonderful doctor. I really hope they keep

129
00:11:52,580 --> 00:12:01,480
you at this hospital forever. Excuse me, Dr. Temma, you have a visitor. Oh, I'm doing my

130
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,220
rounds right now. Tell them I'm too busy at the moment, would you please? Okay, but...

131
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,620
Ava?

132
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,140
It's been a while, hasn't it, Kenzo?

133
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,160
It has.

134
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,280
Both of us have gone through so much.

135
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,940
Hello, Father. Are you sleeping already?

136
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,340
I'm coming in.

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,320

138
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,460

(Crying)

140
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,980
(crying)

141
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,260
Ava, Ava, I know it's difficult, but please,

142
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,200
try to hold yourself--

143
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,300
Don't touch me!

144
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,320
Give me my father back!

145
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,740
I want him back!

146
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,360
I want him back!

147
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,440
(crying)

148
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,900
Kenzo!

149
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Listen, please, forgive me!

150
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,540
I was wrong!

151
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,260
Kenzo?

152
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,040
You look worn out.

153
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,980
You're much thinner.

154
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,500
I guess.

155
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,300
I hear that you took some vacation time.

156
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,300
Well, I think that's great.

157
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,380
You should take a break every once in a while.

158
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,660
You always were such a workaholic.

159
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,860
Seems like you've lost a little weight yourself.

160
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,580
I've had a rough couple of years.

161
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,120
I'm sure you've heard all the rumors.

162
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,360
I've heard a few.

163
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,460
It's spring. You remember?

164
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,400
Almost ten years ago, how the two of us would often go out for a drive.

165
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,220
It was this time of the year when you tried to swim in that river.

166
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,080
I panicked and tried to stop you.

167
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,140
But you insisted and you just...

168
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,980
Look, I'm sorry.

169
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,260
Look, Eva, I can't deal with this now.

170
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,560
Kenzo, I...

171
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,000
I want to start over.

172
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,720
After three failed marriages,

173
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,520
I realized that the only one who ever truly loved me was you.

174
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,360
It was you, Kenzo.

175
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,240
That was a long time ago.

176
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,060
Kenzo!

177
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,180
Please, Kenzo!

178
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,760
I want you to know that I'm very flattered, Eva.

179
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,660
But there's no going back. Goodbye.

180
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,320
Wait, Kenzo! I kept quiet! I didn't say a word!

181
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,960
The police came to my house and asked about your tie!

182
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,940
It seems to me that necktie of yours has gotten you in some kind of trouble.

183
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm absolutely positive that's the one I gave you as a gift when we were together.

184
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,240
If you do as I say, I'll keep quiet about it, I promise you!

185
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,520
There's something very important that only I can accomplish.

186
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,100
I'll tell the police about your tie.

187
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,100
I'll tell them everything.

188
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,320
What's she going on about?

189
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,200
Do you hear me?

190
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,660
I'll tell them how you killed my father nine years ago.

191
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,560
You killed him, Kenzo.

192
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,960
- I don't believe it.

193
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,560
- Oh, I see.

194
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,680
Let's bring Dr. Tenma in for an interrogation right away.

195
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,780
- But sir, there's not enough evidence to tie Dr. Tenma

196
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,980
to what happened with Mr. Maurer and the Fortners.

197
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,660
- That's not what I'm referring to.

198
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,620
I'm talking about the killing at Heidelberg Castle.

199
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,520
- Right away.

200
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,180
Yes, sir.

201
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,220
- Thank you very much for your cooperation.

202
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,540
This could prove to be very helpful

203
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:58,800

Yes, speaking.

209
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,240
Excuse me, the police?

210
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,780
Huh? Dr. Tenma is a murder suspect?

Search the place, officers.

214
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,520
Oh, but Inspector, sir, uh...

215
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,700
What is it?

Hey!

217
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,160
Get out of the way!

218
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,160
You people are interfering with the police!

219
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,880
Like hell!

220
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,580
Dr. Tenma would never be capable of killing anyone!

221
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,200
That's right!

222
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,100
that what he does is save people's lives?

223
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,960
- Dr. Tenma is an innocent man.

224
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,960
- Go away! - Now forget about it!

225
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,640
- He's never done anything wrong.

226
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,040
- We're not gonna talk to you.

227
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,400
He's a great doctor.

228
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,440
- Go away!

229
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,000
- He would never do anything like that.

230
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,620
- This is none of your business.

231
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,000
- Wow, I wonder what's going on in the front.

232
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,860
- See those police cars over there, Dr. Tenma?

233
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,360
Man, ain't that a sight.

234
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
- Is that right?

235
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,820
Anyway, can you drop me off at the station?

236
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,000
No problem.

237
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,600
Hey, Doctor, are you always this busy?

238
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,080
I have...

239
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,360
I have a surgery to perform in the other room.

240
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,080
Dr. Tenma!

241
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Dr. Tenma!

242
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,680
Wait!

243
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,040
Hang in there, kid.

244
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,820
I'll save you, no matter what.

245
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,960
I am not wrong.

246
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,580
He is.

247
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,920
He tells me there's a flaw in my character.

248
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,280
Well, what about him?

249
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,020
He says he's a doctor, but he's just a greedy bastard.

250
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,000
Bastard.

251
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,520
Bastard.

252
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,000
He'd be better off dead.

253
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,160
They're gone, sir.

254
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,300
We can't find them anywhere.

255
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,200
What's going on?

256
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,860
What the hell is going on?

257
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,560
It's been a long time, Doctor.

258
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,100
It's me.

259
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,320
Have you forgotten already, Doctor?

260
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,140
About the twins?

261
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,840
Johan...

262
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,080
Save me, Doctor!

263
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,840
I don't want to die!

264
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,560
I don't want to die!

265
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,780
Doctor!

266
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,580
I was supposed to die that night.

267
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,120
You're the one who resurrected me, Doctor.

268
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,120
(birds chirping)

269
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,760
(engine rumbling)

270
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,880
- It looks like another scorcher today.

271
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,040
Hey, why are you all bundled up

272
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,760
on a hot summer day like this?

273
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,260
Aren't you broiling, huh?

274
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,000
You're reading an old paper. That one's at least three days old.

275
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,500
Yeah, a couple in Verden got themselves murdered.

276
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,520
They say a doctor did it, if you can believe that.

277
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,860
Hey, buddy, you said you were headed for Verden, wasn't that right?

278
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,860
What, you know somebody over there?

279
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,420
Yeah, I do. I'm not even sure if he'll still be there now.

280
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,480
But I have to try and find him.

281
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,940
[MUSIC]

282
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,940
(gentle music)
