1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Dr. Tenma, I don't blame you for saving my brother's life anymore.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,460
You did what you had to do as a doctor. It wasn't your fault.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,540
Please eat the sandwiches, and get some rest, too.

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,100
Please live on, and continue to save as many people as you are able to.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,180
Nina Fortner

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:47,580
Nina

7
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,740
what are you planning to do

8
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,900
are you going to kill your brother

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,260
a second time

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,360
I did it

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:10,700
I brought him back to life that monster it was me I brought him back to life

12
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:57,340
We'll be right back.

13
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:27,340
We'll be right back.

14
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:47,540
There are a lot of blood vessels in this arteriovenous malformation,

15
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,100
cutting all arteries, and now the veins.

16
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,860
Extraction of the nidus is complete

17
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:10,380
That went very well

18
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,760
Yes, as usual

19
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,640
He's remarkably quick with the clipping

20
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,420
An amazing operation

21
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,320
Dr. Tenma, how is it possible that even after a long break

22
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:29,820
the work of a genius like you only gets better and better it's over never mind it isn't important

23
00:03:49,320 --> 00:04:15,380
Isn't that wonderful, Kenzo?

24
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,280
It wasn't even about me.

25
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,260
It was all about your father.

26
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:26,300
Well, that may be true. But it's only because you did such a wonderful job last night working as part of Father's team.

27
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,460
I'm sure he appreciates all your hard work, since you're the one responsible for raising the hospital's reputation.

28
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:39,920
No, I'm the one who should be grateful. I mean, after all, it is thanks to your father that I'm actually able to work here in Germany.

29
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,520
Hang in there, Kinzo. If you stick with Father, your future's guaranteed.

30
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,900
it won't be long before father becomes chairman of the board soon after that

31
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:57,060
you'll become chief of surgery and then chief director which means I'll be the

32
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,920
director's wife you better make me happy Kenzo because hardship doesn't suit me

33
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,060
still want to go out on that date or should we just

34
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:42,260
Please, sir.

35
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,020
Madame is resting at the moment.

36
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,620
I won't need much of her time. This shouldn't take long.

37
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,540
But, sir, you really need to make an appointment with madame.

38
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,520
What's all the racket?

39
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,260
Um, I'm terribly sorry to bother you, madame, but there's a police officer here.

40
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,420
The police?

41
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,960
Miss Eva Heinemann, it's been a while, hasn't it?

42
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,240
And who are you supposed to be?

43
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,340
I worked on your father's case exactly nine years ago.

44
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm Inspector Lungay of the BKA.

45
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,280
Lungay?

46
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,240
Oh, I see.

47
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,080
You may leave us, Hulse.

48
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,160
Yes, madame.

49
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,080
I do remember you all too well.

50
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,880
You were that good-for-nothing detective

51
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
who couldn't even close my father's case.

52
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,300
So tell me, what on earth do you want from me now?

53
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm quite impressed.

54
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,820
You've been able to maintain this residence exactly the same even after your father's death.

55
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,960
Actually, it appears that the decor might have gotten even more extravagant than before.

56
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,700
So then, have you come to see how much money I've made from the inheritance my father left me in all my divorce settlements?

57
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,040
As you can see, detective, I live in absolute comfort.

58
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,540
If you see anything you like, please feel free to take it with you.

59
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,280
As long as I have my liquor by my side, I'm fine.

60
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,160
I've come today because there is something I'd like to show you.

61
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,940
Here, take a look at this necktie.

62
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,920
A necktie?

63
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,320
Does it look familiar?

64
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,400
Perhaps you don't remember.

65
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,040
It's a design from nine years ago.

66
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,160
It has a very simple print,

67
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,140
but if you look at it carefully, it's a wonderful piece.

68
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:44,140
with an extremely elaborate weave so what what about it tracing it back was quite a task after

69
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,140
all it was purchased nine years ago but luckily this was a limited edition offering specially

70
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:57,020
made for a particular store's higher end clients and your name was on that list miss eva heinemann

71
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,540
so what exactly is your point you see i was wondering if you might have purchased this

72
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,260
and given it to someone as a gift.

73
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,480
This necktie is a key piece of evidence in another murder case.

74
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,640
A murder?

75
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,580
Who knows?

76
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,600
I've given gifts to so many men,

77
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,440
I couldn't possibly keep track of them all now, could I?

78
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,820
They're not interested in me anyway.

79
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,460
The only thing they're after is my money.

80
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,160
Please, try to remember.

81
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:39,680
I told you I don't remember these men are all after my money there isn't a single person who

82
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,180
truly loves me for who I am that's why I always stick it to them when it's time for the divorce

83
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,480
settlement I did that to all three of them damn bastards do you want something too you want

84
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:02,020
something just tell me but you'll pay a high price for it I'll be back ma'am if you remember

85
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,820
anything please give me a call next time you stop by detective be sure to bring

86
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Can you bring me something to drink?

87
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Excuse me.

88
00:09:36,820 --> 00:10:00,260
Ava.

89
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,340
Ava.

90
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,620
Ava, please.

91
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,280
You have to talk to your father for me.

92
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,540
Make him see I haven't done anything wrong.

93
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,500
All I did was operate on an emergency patient who was brought in first.

94
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,400
Nothing else.

95
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,760
Wait, is that the ring that I gave to you?

96
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,640
Spare me, Kenzo. You're such a fool.

97
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,620
Ava, why?

98
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,960
Dr. Norton, you're looking very handsome this evening.

99
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,040
Oh, thank you.

100
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,840
You're looking especially beautiful tonight yourself, Ava.

101
00:10:47,840 --> 00:11:05,900
Hulse, have my car ready.

102
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,260
Well, Mr. Hess, you're certainly looking better today.

103
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,820
At this rate, I'm guessing you should be able to go home sometime later this week, all right?

104
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,160
Thank you very much, Dr. Tenma. You did a great job.

105
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,940
By the way, my daughter is getting married next month. Do you think I'll be able to attend her wedding?

106
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,020
Yes, that should be fine. You just have to promise me that you won't get too wild at the reception.

107
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,180
Thanks, Doctor. I had resigned myself to not going, but thanks to you...

108
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,600
Hey, come on. It's because you toughed it out.

109
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,140
With you looking after me, I feel as though I'll even live to see my grandchildren get married.

110
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,780
You truly are a wonderful doctor.

111
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,180
I really hope they keep you at this hospital forever.

112
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,700
Excuse me, Dr. Temma. You have a visitor.

113
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,380
Oh, I'm doing my rounds right now.

114
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,600
Tell them I'm too busy at the moment, would you please?

115
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,380
Okay, but...

116
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:15,600
Ava?

117
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,120
It's been a while, hasn't it, Kenzo?

118
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,160
It has.

119
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,260
Both of us have gone through so much.

120
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,540
Hello, Father.

121
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,940
Are you sleeping already?

122
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,300
I'm coming in.

123
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,420
Father!

124
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,200
Ava, Ava, I know it's difficult, but please, try to hold yourself...

125
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:17,360
Don't touch me! Give me my father back! I want him back! I want him back!

126
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,540
Kenzo! Listen, please! Forgive me! I was wrong!

127
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,280
Kenzo?

128
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,500
Kenzo!

129
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:45,340
you look worn out you're much thinner i guess i hear that you took some vacation time

130
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,420
well i think that's great you should take a break every once in a while

131
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,900
you always were such a workaholic seems like you've lost a little weight yourself

132
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:04,380
i've had a rough couple of years i'm sure you've heard all the rumors i've heard a few

133
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:20,420
it's spring you remember almost 10 years ago how the two of us would often go out for a drive

134
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,260
we were so young it was this time of the year when you tried to swim in that river

135
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:33,000
i panicked and tried to stop you but you insisted and you look i'm sorry

136
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:46,100
look Ava I can't deal with this now Kenzo I I want to start over

137
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:52,320
after three failed marriages I finally realized

138
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,420
that the only one who ever truly loved me was you it was you Kenzo

139
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,680
that was a long time ago

140
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,160
Kenzo

141
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,260
please Kenzo

142
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,780
I want you to know that I'm very flattered Ava

143
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,760
but there's no going back

144
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,740
goodbye

145
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,180
wait Kenzo I kept quiet

146
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,320
I didn't say a word

147
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,980
the police came to my house and asked about your tie

148
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,280
It seems to me that necktie of yours

149
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,960
Has gotten you in some kind of trouble

150
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,560
I'm absolutely positive

151
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,160
That's the one I gave you as a gift

152
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,040
When we were together

153
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,020
If you do as I say

154
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,240
I'll keep quiet about it

155
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,340
I promise you

156
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,080
There's something very important

157
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,660
That only I can accomplish

158
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:11,880
i'll tell the police about your time i'll tell them everything what's she going on do you hear

159
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,560
me i'll tell them how you killed my father nine years ago you killed him kento

160
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Oh, I see.

161
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,700
Let's bring Dr. Tenma in for an interrogation right away.

162
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,980
But, sir, there's not enough evidence to tie Dr. Tenma to what happened with Mr. Maurer and the Fortners.

163
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,660
That's not what I'm referring to.

164
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,660
I'm talking about the killing at Heidelberg Castle.

165
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,520
Right away.

166
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,180
Yes, sir.

167
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,220
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

168
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,220
This could prove to be very helpful in solving several of our open cases.

169
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,220
Resignation? But what is the meaning of this, Dr. Tenma?

170
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,220
I'm very sorry, Director, but I've already made up my mind about this.

171
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,220
There have been various odd rumors going around about you recently.

172
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,220
But I want to be clear, I don't believe any of it.

173
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,220
Please think this over. You have...

174
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,220
Hey, wait! Dr. Tenma!

175
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Yes, speaking.

176
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,220
Excuse me, the police?

177
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,220
Huh? Dr. Tenma is a murder suspect?

178
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:54,440
Close off all the exits

179
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,840
Don't forget the back doors

180
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,600
Yes, sir

181
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,680
Where is Dr. Tenma?

182
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,800
I don't know

183
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,180
Why are you just standing there?

184
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,260
Search the place, officers.

185
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,440
Oh, but Inspector, sir...

186
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,720
What is it?

187
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,180
Hey, get out of the way! You people are interfering with the police!

188
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,600
Like hell, Dr. Tenma would never be capable of killing anyone!

189
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,200
That's right!

190
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,100
Can't you understand that what he does is save people's lives?

191
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,980
Dr. Tenma is an innocent man!

192
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,080
Now forget about it! We're not going to talk to you!

193
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,420
He's a great doctor!

194
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,300
He would never do anything like that!

195
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,640
This is none of your business!

196
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,020
Wow, I wonder what's going on in the front.

197
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,840
See those police cars over there, Dr. Tenma?

198
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,360
Man, ain't that a sight.

199
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Is that right?

200
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,600
Well, I wonder what's going on.

201
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,820
Anyway, can you drop me off at the station?

202
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,960
No problem.

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,600

220
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:52,920
It looks like another scorcher today.

221
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,760
Hey, why are you all bundled up on a hot summer day like this?

222
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,260
Aren't you broiling? Huh?

223
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,960
You're reading an old paper. That one's at least three days old.

224
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,500
Yeah, a couple in Verdun got themselves murdered.

225
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,540
They say a doctor did it, if you can believe that.

226
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,940
Hey, buddy, you said you were headed for Verdun.

227
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,240
Wasn't that right?

228
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,840
What, you know somebody over there?

229
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
Yeah, I do.

230
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
I'm not even sure if he'll still be there now.

231
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,440
I have to try and find him.
