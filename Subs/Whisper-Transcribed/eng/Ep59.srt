1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,100
Yeah, like I know what your usual is.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,180
Come on, when are you going to remember, Robbie?

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,380
And here it comes, a double cheeseburger that's well done,

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,840
extra ketchup, and thick tomato slices.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,400
And if I see any pickles, I'm going to kill you.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,700
All right, I'll hold the pickles.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,700
See that Chinese or Vietnamese guy down there, he's been asking me about you.

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,640
Lately, he shows up here pretty regular.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,860
He was asking who you were.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,680
Nah, from the look of him, that guy's not Chinese.

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:01:00,000
or vietnamese oh no i'm betting he's japanese i'd say he's a neurosurgeon and a brilliant one

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,300
yeah that sound about right dr kenzo tenma

13
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,560
answer me

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,660
your ex-fiance's father was director at the hospital where you worked

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,220
What are you planning to do with Ava?

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,520
Ava?

17
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,000
That's Miss Heinemann to you, punk.

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,200
What, do you think you're still engaged or something?

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,620
Besides, you're no longer a doctor.

20
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,300
You're a fugitive from the law.

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,380
Why don't you go and serve your time?

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,340
It's where you belong.

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,900
You might even get out someday if you behave yourself.

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,340
You have to let Ava go.

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,720
Let her go?

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,020
You're talking like you think I'm holding her hostage or something.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,920
She does what she wants.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,380
I mean, hell, she's been going to parties every night.

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,240
I want to see her. Now, where is she?

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,100
You want to see her?

31
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,060
Come on. I don't want my place getting trashed.

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,000
Knock it off.

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,280
If you know what's good for you, you won't come back.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,960
A-Ava...

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Forget her.

36
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,060
(upbeat music)

37
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,100
Hold on, you saw Kenzo?

38
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah.

39
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Two days ago.

40
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,320
I just thought maybe you'd want to know.

41
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,660
Can you believe he was asking to see you?

42
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,200
When he asked about me, did you hit him?

43
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,060
Huh?

44
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,340
Course not.

45
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
- How can you do a thing like that?

46
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,700
- Come on, we're leaving.

47
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,800
- What?

48
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,300
You've decided you've had enough of this party?

49
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,100
Is that it?

50
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,160
- Not just for today.

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,720
The party's over, I think.

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,180
I think I'm done.

53
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,960
- Job well done, Eva.

54
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,100
Will you allow me to accompany you to dinner?

55
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,160
- Why not?

56
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,120
Let me get this straight.

57
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,600
You dropped her off with your client at a fancy restaurant, and you're eating dinner

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,020
here?

59
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,100
From the way I see it, Robbie, the burgers here are a lot better than any of the food

60
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
at those parties or expensive restaurants.

61
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,280
I don't know whether I should feel flattered or insulted by what you just said

62
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,100
You sure are persistent you want to get hurt again

63
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,540
Didn't you understand me last time when I

64
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,240
You behind the counter, don't move!

65
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,100
If you move, I'll shoot him.

66
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,980
Look at that, Robby. A doctor with a gun.

67
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Who hired you?

68
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,800
I know that the baby is the regular boss that you usually answer to.

69
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,720
But the person who ordered you to escort Ava is someone much higher up in your organization.

70
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,840
Who gave you your orders?

71
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,680
I couldn't tell you what his name is.

72
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,220
But I do know his face.

73
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,140
The guy wears a pair of glasses.

74
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,560
and what exactly was Eva given as her assignment?

75
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,420
I thought I told you last time.

76
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,020
He's just got her going to all these high-class parties.

77
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,220
She eats and drinks and leaves.

78
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,400
That's about it.

79
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,240
That can't be all she does.

80
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,080
Whatever he's got planned for her,

81
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,080
it has to be more significant than that.

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,560
Eh, well, it's not.

83
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,760
Tonight, for instance.

84
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,860
I'm listening.

85
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Ah, forget it. It's really no big deal.

86
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,820
All she did tonight was point at someone.

87
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:40,780
She pointed at someone yeah, she pointed at this young man a young man. What are you like this?

88
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,300
He was a young man with blonde hair and a pretty face

89
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,620
She pointed at him like I'm pointing at you right now. That was it

90
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,060
So, where's she now, where's Ava

91
00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:00,000
Having dinner with my boss that guy with the glasses. I told you about where tell me quickly. Where are they?

92
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,060
Don't you see? That was all they needed her for!

93
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,180
As soon as this job is completed, I'll probably be killed anyway.

94
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,160
The party's over, I think.

95
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,020
Where is Eva?

96
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,620
Wait!

97
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,400
(tires screeching)

98
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,980
(tires screeching)

99
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,140
- Where is she?

100
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,640
- I had her taken back to her hotel.

101
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,720
Now tell me something, do you have a gun?

102
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,180
No, I don't, sir. I try not to carry one of those around. Too much trouble.

103
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,320
Well, in that case, use this.

104
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,200
Do it right. Finish her off.

105
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,160
That day, the party we went to took place the same as always.

106
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,940
The smell of drinks and perfume, the obscure conversations, the empty laughter.

107
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:37,320
same, except for that one moment, that moment when Ava pointed at somebody.

108
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,460
Once she did that, the man with glasses walked over with another well-dressed young man.

109
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,560
After sharing a few words, those two young men shook hands.

110
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,900
I didn't realize it at the time,

111
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,660
but it would appear that that's when Ava's job was over.

112
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,680
I guess I always knew that you would be the one they'd send to kill me, Martin.

113
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,780
- Go right ahead.

114
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,740
The drinks are doing their job nicely.

115
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,340
I have no real regrets about what I've done with my life.

116
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,180
(laughs)

117
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,260
Oh, sorry.

118
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,580
I forgot you can't shoot me here in my room.

119
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
You told me that when you shot your girlfriend,

120
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,960
you found yourself in a sea of blood,

121
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,800
so this setup won't work, right?

122
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,200
It'd be better if you take me outside and shoot me,

123
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,820
'cause if you don't, you'll have to pay

124
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,540
(laughing)

125
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,340
Wait, maybe I do have one regret.

126
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,500
I'm having second thoughts here,

127
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,880
but it doesn't really matter, does it?

128
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,180
I was wondering, exactly what did I do tonight?

129
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,040
You saw me point out that young man, didn't you?

130
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,420
You know, I think I might've done something terrible.

131
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,800
I just brought together a horrible man

132
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,900
and the devil himself.

133
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,220
It was like bringing together Mephistopheles and Faust.

134
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,960
But who the hell cares anyway?

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,020
Too bad that now that I've done my job,

136
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,360
all these party invitations are gonna get wasted.

137
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,680
But the good news is I still have my invitation

138
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,860
to the most important party, don't I?

139
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,920
Hey, after you shoot me, do me a favor.

140
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,240
Maybe you can go to these parties in my place

141
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,940
after I'm dead and see what I've done.

142
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,620
(gulping)

143
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,480
- So, now then, go on and finish me off.

144
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,520
- Let's run away.

145
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,300
I want you to run away with me.

146
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,420
(laughing)

147
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,620
- Where'd you come up with that idea?

148
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,860
Me, run away with you?

149
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,220
You're kidding, right?

150
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,140
Refresh my memory.

151
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,840
When did you and I become so close?

152
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,580
I can't do it. I can't kill people anymore.

153
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,140
You can't kill people?

154
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,600
Well, I bet that you can still kill a devil, because that's what I am!

155
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,560
You think I bought you that new suit and necktie because I like you?

156
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,540
Those are the same clothes that Kenzo used to wear!

157
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,040
Don't you get it? I was just turning you into Kenzo Tenma!

158
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,520
Just kill me already!

159
00:11:45,960 --> 00:12:01,000
Come on! Do it! Quick! Kill me! Quickly! Kill me quickly, you big jerk. If you don't kill

160
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,480
Tell me quickly, they'll come to kill you too.

161
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,620
Kill the devil, huh?

162
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,800
Come on, Mom! Wake up!

163
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,080
It's all right. After a nap, I'll start sobering up.

164
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,940
Well, you can't nap now! You'll die if you go to sleep here!

165
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,680
I'll be fine. Just leave me here so I can rest.

166
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,360
(owl hooting)

167
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,140
You look depressed today.

168
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
What do you mean, Robbie?

169
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,960
I always look like this.

170
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,280
So tell me, has anybody come around here looking for me today?

171
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,040
Well, nobody knew, but that Japanese doctor guy from yesterday left you this.

172
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,520
The Hellbrow Hotel, room number 205.

173
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,160
He said to call him if anything happened.

174
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,680
So, what'll you have, Martin?

175
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,000
Do you want your usual?

176
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,640
Not today.

177
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,420
Fill my stomach with your lousy burgers,

178
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,060
and I won't feel like going anywhere.

179
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,360
Oh, yeah? Where are you going?

180
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,420
Another party.

181
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,240
[Chuckles]

182
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,620
It's amazing.

183
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,080
I can go anywhere if I have a necktie.

184
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,500
Just a single little necktie.

185
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:41,260
Jackpot. So, he's the devil? After shaking hands with what seemed like countless people,

186
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,460
Well, he left the party alone.

187
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,520
(suspenseful music)

188
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,980
- On the sixth floor, huh?

189
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,320
But which one is his?

190
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,540
- Good evening, why don't you please come inside?

191
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,380
Make yourself at home, have a seat.

192
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,280
(footsteps)

193
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,420
- So you want to meet him too, don't you?

194
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,820
- Meet who?

195
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,000
- I'm waiting for him as well.

196
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,240
He'll be here soon.

197
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,000
Since we've got some time to spare,

198
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,160
let's talk about something.

199
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,380
What would be good to talk about?

200
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,760
Oh, I've got it.

201
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,560
Why don't we talk about the end of the world?

202
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,800
- The young man continued talking cheerfully.

203
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,220
He was like a kid telling his parents about how much fun he had that day at school.

204
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,540
That was how he talked to me.

205
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,520
End of the world? Please.

206
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,240
Just a crazy maniac spouting nonsense.

207
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,560
That's what I thought at the time.

208
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,880
What do you think? It's interesting, isn't it?

209
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,880
Have I piqued your curiosity yet, Mr. Martin?

210
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,360
Hold on a second, kid. How do you know my name?

211
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,240
I just know. Now let's talk all about you, shall we?

212
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,620
You've worked for the baby for three years, haven't you?

213
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,160
What? Did you look into my background?

214
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,560
Before that, you served time in prison for eight years.

215
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,040
That must have been awful for you.

216
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,460
You were released early for good behavior.

217
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,720
For a guy that got convicted of murder, you certainly got out quickly.

218
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,640
Did you like living with your girlfriend?

219
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,460
I'm pretty sure you did.

220
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm talking about the girlfriend you shot.

221
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,140
Her name was... Eda?

222
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,260
I think it's pretty rude of you to talk about her.

223
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,080
That Eda was quite the drug addict, wasn't she?

224
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,560
And you did your best to try and keep her off the stuff, didn't you?

225
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,320
Goodness, that's a pretty difficult thing to pull off.

226
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,980
Were you... in love then?

227
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,460
Were you asking me for a beating?

228
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,460
Then she quit the drug somehow.

229
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,840
All was bliss and she would wait for you to come home every night.

230
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,120
Together, the two of you were quite happy.

231
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,020
Are you asking for a beating? Answer me.

232
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,200
But then one night, when you returned to your room,

233
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,600
you saw something that really made your blood boil.

234
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,220
There she was, with her old boyfriend.

235
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,620
She'd been doing drugs again. It was written all over her face.

236
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,060
But once she saw you standing there,

237
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,940
all she could do was say the same thing over and over.

238
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

239
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,720
But you shot her, along with her ex-boyfriend.

240
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,600
That was your story at the trial, after all. Why'd you lie?

241
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,180
That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

242
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,540
The truth was, she killed herself.

243
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,620
Your lawyer figured out from the lab reports that she shot herself.

244
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,660
They found traces of gunpowder on her right hand.

245
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,460
You stuck to the story that you gunned her down.

246
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,720
Tell the truth. She literally begged you to kill her, didn't she?

247
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,660
Ha! Am I right? I'm dead on, aren't I?

248
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,000
I knew you weren't the one who shot her!

249
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,740
And she really was begging you to shoot her, wasn't she?

250
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,560
Oh, I could just see it.

251
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Please, Martin, shoot me.

252
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,080
Please don't look at me like that.

253
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
Shoot me now!

254
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,400
I want you to kill me!

255
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,120
Martin!

256
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,920
It wasn't me!

257
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,320
She did it to herself!

258
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,760
I didn't shoot her, man!

259
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,720
(panting)

260
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,620
See?

261
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,940
It was me, right?

262
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,740
Right?

263
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,100
(gunshot)

264
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
- Isn't it amazing that I was able to figure it out?

265
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,080
I'm right, aren't I?

266
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,340
- You're wrong.

267
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,640
- You made the decision to leave her behind.

268
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,640
And by doing that, you gave her just what she wanted.

269
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,580
- Like hell.

270
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,480
- I'm right.

271
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,960
It was the same with your mother!

272
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,340
Your mother froze to death.

273
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,160
She died unexpectedly when you were ten years old.

274
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,260
You've got a long history of abandoning women, don't you?

275
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,620
Ha ha! I'm right again!

276
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,340
I knew it! Amazing!

277
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,920
I really have a gift for this! What a skill!

278
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,100
Every night, your mother would get stinking drunk and you'd carry her home.

279
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,120
Isn't that right?

280
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,580
And your mother would always tell you to just leave her where she was.

281
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,420
the street, but you wouldn't listen. Instead, you'd carry her home every time. But then

282
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,900
came that one night.

283
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,700
No, Mom. It's too cold. You can't sleep out here.

284
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,100
This weather's fine. Stop falling on me. Just lay me right here.

285
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,680
Mom, wake up!

286
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,140
You left her there. Isn't that true? You left your mother there.

287
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,100
The next day, the police came to your house and told you that your mother had frozen to death.

288
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,800
You thought that what happened wasn't your fault.

289
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,220
After all, you had left her there because she told you to.

290
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,940
And you're right. It wasn't your fault.

291
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,860
Your mother and your girlfriend both wanted to die.

292
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,600
You were helping people who wanted to die to find some relief.

293
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,420
Why torture yourself? You did the right thing.

294
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,340
Look, you freed the two of them from the agonies of their worthless lives.

295
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,600
Now there's Ava. She too wishes to die, Martin.

296
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,420
It was at that moment that the devil arrived.

297
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,000
I walked by the devil, careful not to look.

298
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:23,760
Like a child, I repeated to myself, "Don't look, don't look, don't you dare look."
