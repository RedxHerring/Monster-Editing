1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:09,160
Ava Heinemann? Oh yeah, she was here. She's fallen on pretty hard times, but her snotty attitude is still the same.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,120
Come to think of it, it's gotten even worse.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,640
Did Ava happen to mention to you where she was staying?

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,580
Yeah, she said she'd forgotten her cash and to collect the tab I'd have to go to her hotel.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,440
I guess she still thinks she's a princess, huh?

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,940
And which hotel was that?

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,640
The stag in hotel. I mean come on. She stand at a third-rate hotel claims

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,560
She forgot her cash. He really thinks she's gonna come back to pay her bar tab

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,680
wait

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Aren't you? Yeah, now that I think of it you were engaged to her. Yeah

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,560
He's that doctor

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,800
Yeah, hello police just now that serial killer was right here in my bar hey

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,860
Any idea where my coat went?

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,580
What?

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,120
I hung my coat up on the rack right there by your front door.

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:02,680
Huh?

17
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,260
(dramatic music)

18
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,320
(train rumbling)

19
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,600
(train horn blaring)

20
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,860
(train horn blaring)

21
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,900
(train horn blaring)

22
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,800
- Hello?

23
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,880
Yes, excuse me.

24
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,920
I'm trying to reach a lady named Ava Heineman

25
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,240
who's staying at your hotel.

26
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,480
- All right, sir.

27
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,580
I'm putting you on hold while I call her room.

28
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,400
Please stand by.

29
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,140
(phone ringing)

30
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,440
- Make it quick.

31
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,560
Please hurry.

32
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,520
- To tell you the truth,

33
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm thinking of killing someone.

34
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,540
Your former fiance, the lovely Eva Heinemann.

35
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,700
- Come on.

36
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,060
- Thank you for waiting.

37
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,300
- Yes.

38
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,640
- We rang her room, sir, but she's not picking up.

39
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,200
- What's her room number?

40
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,220
I'd like you to deliver an important business fax to her, so would you please tell me what her room number is?

41
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,400
Please tell me.

42
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,860
Oh sure, she's in 402.

43
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,800
Our fax number here is...

44
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,580
Room 402...

45
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,300
(phone ringing)

46
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,860
- It's no good.

47
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,880
Mr. Ball isn't in his office

48
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,780
and he's not answering his cell phone either.

49
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,640
- I'm beginning to think that your partner

50
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,860
won't meet with us no matter how long we wait.

51
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,540
And here's what my reasoning is in saying that.

52
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,780
Mr. Ball became Dr. Tenma's lawyer

53
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,360
to prove his client was innocent.

54
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,360
Then Tenma complicated things by escaping from the police

55
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
after confessing to the crime.

56
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,780
With his client displaying that kind of guilty behavior,

57
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,700
Well, he's left with no choice but to withdraw.

58
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,220
Hmm...

59
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,040
Mr. Werdemann, are you going to quit too?

60
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,980
I don't plan on quitting, but I didn't plan on Tenma escaping either.

61
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,720
Since I'm his lawyer, I want him to trust me, but his actions are confusing.

62
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,400
We're all confused by what he's done, but do you even believe him?

63
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,560
Do you believe what he said happened in Munich, Mr. Werdemann?

64
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,780
Do you actually believe all of the things that Tenma has told you are true?

65
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,920
No answer.

66
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,120
To me, that means you didn't believe anything that he said to you, did you?

67
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,600
I was shocked and disappointed when I heard the news that Tenma had escaped,

68
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,640
but most of all I couldn't believe that he'd lied about his guilt.

69
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,600
And I had that same unsettled feeling during the library fire

70
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,840
Something like that is happening again, and Tenma escaped for that reason.

71
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,960
You have to believe in him, just like your belief in your father's innocence led you to become a lawyer.

72
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,760
The phone has been ringing off the hook.

73
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,300
The media is begging to have you answer one question.

74
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,780
As a top lawyer, will you still continue to defend Tenma?

75
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,140
Tell them at this time I have no comment.

76
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,680
Are you kidding? They won't take that for an answer.

77
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,680
They'll eat you alive!

78
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,340
Tell them that I will be holding a press conference

79
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,420
after I thoroughly examine all of the facts of this very unusual situation.

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,640
And until that time, don't let anybody into my office.

81
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,860
But you have a visitor waiting in your office.

82
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,300
So you let someone in here without consulting me first?

83
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,860
Look, I don't want to see anyone.

84
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,240
Sorry. I told him that and tried to turn him away,

85
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,220
- Well, he insisted I'm waiting for you.

86
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,420
- Who is he, anyway?

87
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,960
- Well, he's with, he's with the German Federal Police.

88
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,580
- The BKA?

89
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,520
Over the Rainbow.

90
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,140
It's quite a nice song.

91
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,720
I believe it was the theme song of the radio station

92
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,840
that your father ran.

93
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,360
- So, who are you?

94
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm Inspector Lungay.

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,400
406.

96
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,200
405.

97
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,820
404.

98
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,160
Room 402.

99
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,980
That's her room.

100
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,320
(gulping)

101
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,340
- Guten tag.

102
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,460
- Oh, guten tag.

103
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,920
(gasping)

104
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,780
Pardon me.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,400
- Huh?

106
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,120
- Where's the guest staying

107
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,400
What?

108
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,700
Oh, the woman who was staying in this room.

109
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,280
I was dropping by to visit her.

110
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:20,960
You were?

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,040
I was told this room's guest was already checked out.

112
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,860
Hey!

113
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,940
You see? Told you that person was gone.

114
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,520
Eva...

115
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,900
Inspector Lungay, you have my thanks for your thoroughness in the report that you wrote on Tenma.

116
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,460
In doing my research to learn more about my client, I read many reports. Yours was elaborate and outstanding.

117
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,900
I must say as well, I'm quite aware of your reputation as a star in the legal world, Mr. Vertimon.

118
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,220
I imagine you're here because of the news of Dr. Tenma's recent escape.

119
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,260
Even though he's a client of mine, let me assure you, he hasn't contacted me and I don't know where he is at this time.

120
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,820
Oh, so he escaped.

121
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,660
Actually, I'm not here on that matter.

122
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,940
I'm on something of an extended vacation.

123
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,960
You know, in a way, I feel like I've made an escape as well.

124
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,640
Having this time off has been refreshing.

125
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Well, I hope you'll excuse me, but right now I have no time for small talk, so...

126
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,420
Of course. I do have a specific question, actually.

127
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,040
Maybe it's a habit I got through my work, but I just can't take a real vacation.

128
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,800
I find myself coming up with a theme for each of my trips.

129
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,460
This is the theme for this trip.

130
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,880
This picture book I'm holding.

131
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,560
Look, Inspector. I'm out of time. You have to leave.

132
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,060
Please, let's talk a little longer.

133
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,100
So you really haven't come here to talk about Tenma?

134
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,400
To be quite honest, right now Tenma is the furthest thing from my mind.

135
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,160
Besides, I only just heard the news about Tenma's escape.

136
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,700
I heard it while I was on my way over here.

137
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,300
Well, then why did you bother coming to my office?

138
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,080
As I said, it's this book.

139
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,380
I've become intensely interested in finding out about this picture book's author.

140
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,520
But the man who authored this book had many pen names.

141
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,220
The only German pen name he used was Klaus Poppe.

142
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,740
Learning more about this mystery man became a challenge for me.

143
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,340
I investigated further and came across the name of someone Pope was acquainted with.

144
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,620
Who was it?

145
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,400
Your father knew Pope.

146
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,640
The radio station your father owned had a program called "The World's Fables."

147
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,980
According to records in August of 1966, Pope's work "Where Am I?" was aired on his station.

148
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,720
I've read transcripts of your father's trial for spying.

149
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,600
The espionage trial shook all of post-war West Germany, or so they say.

150
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,400
I know that. So what's your point?

151
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,380
Records indicate your father had traveled to Czechoslovakia on numerous occasions.

152
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,540
Since he was just meeting a picture book artist, his trips went unnoticed and weren't brought up at his trial.

153
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,740
Just what are you implying went on?

154
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,960
Well, I'm implying that based on my research, your father appears to have been old friends with this picture book artist.

155
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,520
My father knew many people due to the nature of his work.

156
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,080
He met and had meetings with countless people.

157
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,580
That was his job.

158
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,300
So you're saying that your father and Poppe weren't well acquainted then?

159
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,640
Nonetheless, according to the investigative work I did,

160
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,900
Klaus Poppe usually met with people at his editor's house,

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,120
or they would meet at his vacation home,

162
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,880
which was an old farm in the suburbs of Prague.

163
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,440
But when he would meet with your father,

164
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,640
he always did so at a certain mansion.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,540
the place was known as the Red Rose Mansion but he never did meet people in

166
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,560
that location while using the name Klaus Pope. When he used the Red Rose

167
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:18,320
Mansion he called himself by another name, the name Franz Bonaparta and he

168
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,380
was someone who was a very important person in the Czechoslovakian secret

169
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:23,900
police.

170
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,400
(eerie music)

171
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,720
- What are you, what are you trying to say?

172
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,000
- Spy kid, spy kid, spy kid.

173
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,340
- Son of a traitor spy, that's you.

174
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
- You son of a coward spy.

175
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,460
- Hey, if you don't like that,

176
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
then find a way to prove your dad's innocent.

177
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,660
- If the dad's a traitor, the son's a spy too.

178
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:06,620
Spike it! Spike it! Spike it! Spike it! Spike it!

179
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,440
I just want to learn about Franz Bonaparta.

180
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,100
What can you tell me?

181
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,940
I know of no such person.

182
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,800
In 1966, your father met with Klaus Poppe at a certain mansion in Czechoslovakia.

183
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,740
That's what really happened back then, isn't it?

184
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,520
It was just an author and a radio station owner having a business meeting.

185
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,380
That picture book author never went by the name Klaus Pope when he used the Red Rose Mansion.

186
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,260
Hold on. What exactly are you trying to say?

187
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,380
When that author of children's books met with your father, they met at the Red Rose Mansion.

188
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,580
Which means he wasn't meeting your father as Klaus Pope, but as Franz Bonaparta.

189
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,560
So your father was actually meeting with someone who was an important part of the Czechoslovakian secret police.

190
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,660
That's not what happened, dammit!

191
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,960
Please allow me to make one thing clear.

192
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,360
whether or not your father was a spy.

193
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,680
But my father wasn't a spy!

194
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,180
I know you believe that,

195
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,460
but your father surely must have known

196
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,440
Franz Bonaparte's real identity.

197
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,800
How is that relevant?

198
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,600
You may not wish to accept it, but it certainly appears

199
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,280
your father knew what was going on

200
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
in the Red Rose Mansion, didn't he?

201
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,820
No! No!

202
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,560
My father was innocent! Innocent!

203
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,600
You're wrong!

204
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,360
I'm hoping that you'll get in touch with me

205
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,500
after you calm down.

206
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:33,080
When you want to talk more on this subject call me and know this I don't care if your father was a spy or not

207
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:39,300
I'm not concerned with that. My only interest here is to learn more about Franz Bonaparta

208
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,560
My father was never

209
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,260
Excuse me your wife's on the phone. She'd like to huh

210
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,120
Huh? Is there something wrong, sir?

211
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,440
No.

212
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,040
It's your wife. She said she's calling from the maternity ward at the hospital.

213
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,120
Oh, I see.

214
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,500
Hey, honey.

215
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,580
So you can come home? Well, that's great news.

216
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,260
Sure, I'll come over there right away to pick you up.

217
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,980
Dr. Tenma!

218
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,340
Start driving now!

219
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,140
Just calm down. Listen, everything is alright.

220
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,420
- I said start driving.

221
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,120
Move it!

222
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,660
(tires screeching)

223
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,520
- Stop pointing that gun.

224
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,100
Just calm down, Tenma.

225
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,080
I don't understand.

226
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,320
What the hell's going on?

227
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,260
- Where is Eva?

228
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,040
Where is Eva Heinemann?

229
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,160
- What are you talking about?

230
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,320
Why in the world are you asking about her?

231
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,640
- Don't play dumb.

232
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,360
You really think I don't know

233
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,760
what you're trying to pull here?

234
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,360
Don't stop the car.

235
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,680
Keep your eyes on the road and keep going.

236
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,340
I finally figured out what you're really about.

237
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,320
You just wanted Ava.

238
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,180
I don't understand you.

239
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,080
What would I want with Ava?

240
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,560
Spare me your lies.

241
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,040
I know who you're working with, and I know what he's done.

242
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,700
You're partners with that man Ball.

243
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,740
What of it?

244
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,280
He's the man that I shot during that library

245
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,780
fire at Munich University.

246
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,280
I won't let any more people be murdered.

247
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,600
Answer me.

248
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,460
I saved Johan's life, that's what put this all in motion.

249
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,660
So many people have died since that night.

250
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,840
So many precious lives.

251
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,520
I've seen enough bloodshed.

252
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,780
I won't let more innocent people die!

253
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,800
Why did you stop the car?

254
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Is that true?

255
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,120
I told you to keep driving.

256
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,820
Is all of what you just said true?

257
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,040
I need to know if it's the truth!

[ Horn honks ]

259
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,480
My father was suspected of espionage and charged.

260
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,640
He was proven innocent after the fact,

261
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,900
but it turned out he really was a spy.

262
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,800
I believed in my father's innocence, and I studied hard to become a lawyer so I could

263
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,580
fight injustice.

264
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,680
But while I was still in law school, I found something that devastated me.

265
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,720
I found decisive evidence that proved my father was a spy.

266
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,860
Ever since, ever since, I could never believe what anyone told me.

267
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:16,480
Me, the great honest crusading lawyer, the hero of the legal world!

268
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,620
My whole life is a lie, so I don't believe in anyone!

269
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,240
In reality, I really was the son of a turncoat spy.

270
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,860
Ever since I found that notebook...

271
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,280
Ever since I found that notebook that my father had written in the '60s,

272
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,360
as I flipped through its pages, everything about my father I had believed,

273
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,260
all that trust just crumbled.

274
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,280
There was the truth.

275
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,060
My father was a spy.

276
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,980
The notebook I found was a detailed record of years of contact.

277
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,000
"Contact with the Czechoslovakian secret police written in an unbreakable code.

278
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:13,840
Filled with mysterious people my father knew, including Franz Bonaparta."

279
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,580
Did he refer to Red Rose Mansion in the notebook?

280
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Hold on, how do you know about that?

281
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,780
It's all falling into place.

282
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,340
Huh?

283
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,920
That man, Ball, he needed the notebook.

284
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,540
It's probably why he approached you in the first place, so he could get a hold of it.

285
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,080
Where is that notebook right now?

286
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,300
It's at my house.

287
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,500
I'm sorry.

288
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,660
He's been here all right.

289
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,040
And from the way he's left things, we know he was after that notebook.

290
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,640
Here's a letter that's made out to you, Tenma.

291
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,520
I can't say how, but he must have known that you would wind up being here.

292
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,240
Help me, Kenzo. Please, I'm begging you.

293
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,140
Come quickly to the Red Rose Mansion, Ava.

294
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,500
Does this mean that Ava's safe, then?

295
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,920
No.

296
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,940
This isn't her handwriting.

297
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,380
He's playing games with me!

298
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,080
He's toying with me like a cat and a mouse!

299
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,320
It's still here.

300
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,620
He didn't think to look through my old records.

301
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,720
Oh, for the rainbow.

302
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,940
This is the notebook.

303
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,360
Here, take it.

304
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,420
But what if someone else saw it?

305
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,160
Your father's restored reputation would be ruined forever.

306
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,260
I can't be worried about that anymore.

307
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,600
Can I trust you?

308
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,480
I heard everything you told me, and now I know why you're trying to do what you're

309
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:19,800
doing.

310
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,780
And yet I don't feel I can be of any help to you, but I need to know if I can trust

311
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,580
I don't think you should trust any person who carries one of these around.

312
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,020
I want to trust you.
