1
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,820
Sorry to bother you at this hour.

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,800
We're here on official police business.

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,620
Would you happen to be Dr. Tenma?

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,020
Can I help you?

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,220
Pardon my asking, but were you home all last night?

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,060
What?

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,480
No, I...

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,260
I was out drinking until dawn.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,660
Why do you ask?

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,320
Well, sir, Eisler Memorial Hospital's Director Heinemann, Chief of Surgery Dr. Oppenheim,

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,660
and Dr. Boyer...

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,460
[GROANING]

13
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,220
(dramatic music)

14
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,460
- No one except the police are allowed

15
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,680
But you're interfering with the operation of this hospital.

16
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,200
Press is not allowed inside.

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,100
We can't have patients in this kind of chaos.

18
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,880
Can you tell us, please?

19
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,660
Was it an accident or was it murder?

20
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,220
Three people died at the same time.

21
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,420
Of course it was murder.

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,940
Are you part of the hospital staff?

23
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,520
Tell us. Would you happen to know anything about this incident?

24
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,000
Out of my way. Let me through.

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,220
Hey, no one's allowed in.

26
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,740
I work here. I'm Dr. Kenzo Tenma.

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,940
Come on, step back.

28
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,440
So, did you see anyone suspicious earlier tonight?

29
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,000
- I don't think this is the time to be--

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,580
- Oh, Dr. Tenma.

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,820
Dr. Tenma, the director and the others.

32
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,540
- Calm down, everyone.

33
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,360
Is the emergency room running smoothly?

34
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
- Well, actually, we're swamped

35
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,140
with emergency cases right now, doctor.

36
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,660
Two patients are waiting to be operated on.

37
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,500
- All right then, I'll see what I can do.

38
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,480
- Can you take care of the car accident victim

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,440
with the brain contusion?

40
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,440
- First, I'll go look over the x-rays.

41
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,820
How about the other case?

42
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,640
- The patient collapsed with a stroke.

43
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,360
- Ah, doctor, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.

44
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,620
I understand, but this initial investigation is vital.

45
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,900
Do you know of anyone who could have possibly held a grudge against the Director and the others?

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,520
A grudge?

47
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,420
You have successfully tied the noose around your own neck, Tenma.

48
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,080
Doctor? Did someone come to mind?

49
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,620
No. Sorry.

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,100
Doctor Tenma! We have a problem!

51
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,980
Those kids! The twins! The boy and the girl!

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,160
They're gone, sir! We can't find them anywhere!

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,500
And is the little girl's bed empty as well, nurse?

54
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,140
I already checked, but they're both just gone.

55
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,220
What's going on?

56
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,880
What the hell is going on?

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,600
In his mercy, he lent a hand to many who were ill and suffering.

58
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,340
We will always remember his great accomplishments.

59
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,460
Farewell, Dr. Heinemann.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,340
May you rest in peace.

61
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,280
Amen.

62
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,400
Father!

63
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,460
(crying)

64
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,500
- Ava, Ava, I know it's difficult,

65
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,160
but please, try to hold yourself.

66
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,220
- Don't touch me!

67
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,300
Give me my father back!

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,660
I want him back!

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,620
I want him back!

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,520
- This whole funeral business is just too sad, Dr. Tenma.

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,580
- Yeah.

72
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,340
- Up until now, she was fed with a silver spoon

73
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,460
as the director's daughter.

74
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,360
But now suddenly, she's just another ordinary person.

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,460
That's gotta be quite a big shock.

76
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,420
- How can you say that right now?

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,840
- Sorry about that.

78
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,280
- Dr. Tenma?

79
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,880
I am Inspector Weisbaugh

80
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,260
of the Nordheim-Westfalen Police Department.

81
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,600
- Thank you for your efforts.

82
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,360
- This was such a tragedy.

83
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:31,820
- Yes.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,040
- Let me introduce you.

85
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,100
Dr. Tenma?

86
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,120
- I am Inspector Lunge.

87
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,100
I've heard about your amazing abilities, Doctor.

88
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,660
No, I... I still have a long ways to go.

89
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,300
Um, do you have any leads at all to the children's whereabouts?

90
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,400
No, but we have determined the cause of death for the Director and the other two doctors.

91
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,060
We have discovered traces of nitrate inside all three of their bodies.

92
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,620
So there were traces of nitrate? That's a muscle relaxant.

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,640
or not a doctor for nothing.

94
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,160
- How could something like that end up in--

95
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,040
- It was candy.

96
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,620
- Huh, candy?

97
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,140
- It turns out the same candy wrapper

98
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,140
was found beside each of the bodies.

99
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,820
The same substance was also found in each of their stomachs.

100
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,500
Tell me, would you have any idea

101
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,020
where they might have gotten this candy

102
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,000
or something else of that sort?

103
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,600
- I wouldn't know where they got it from.

104
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,120
If you don't mind me asking,

105
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,640
how is the search for the twins going?

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,960
"The BKA has taken over jurisdiction on this particular case from the local authorities.

107
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,480
Please don't worry."

108
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,100
"Hmm."

109
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,800
"As it stands, after investigating certain events, we believe all this could be tied

110
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,600
back to the moment the twins' parents were shot to death.

111
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,940
First their parents defect from East Germany and are murdered soon after that.

112
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,620
Then staff from the hospital where the children were treated are also murdered.

113
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
Political terrorism may be a possibility.

114
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,620
Those children might hold a major key to this whole mystery."

115
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,100
Please do your best to find them, Inspector.

116
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,580
We certainly will.

117
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,220
Excuse us.

118
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,820
Interesting.

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,480
A Japanese doctor demoted by the director

120
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,680
and then his engagement with the director's daughter

121
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,400
broken right before the incident.

122
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,020
But the man was in the bar drinking

123
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,480
at the time the crime was committed.

124
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,600
It checks out.

125
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,700
Um, mind if I ask you something?

126
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:44,160
move like that oh oh this i was just typing i'm inputting all the information onto the hard drive

127
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:52,820
in my head and if i access the information no i i still have a long ways to go dr tenma was

128
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,520
actually quite modest about it when i commented on his well-recognized talents earlier

129
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,360
Hmm...

130
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,040
The police, huh?

131
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,880
What, are they thinking you're a suspect?

132
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,800
There's enough evidence to implicate me.

133
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
Nothing I can do about it.

134
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,400
Ah, don't worry about it.

135
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,680
They were persistent when they questioned me, too.

136
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,640
God, I'm so exhausted.

137
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,400
Once this whole thing gets settled,

138
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,740
I think I'm gonna go back to Japan.

139
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,400
Huh?

140
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,840
I came to Germany to do research,

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,540
but with everything that's happened,

142
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,540
The most important thing for a doctor is to save lives.

143
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,360
Come on, don't get all depressed on me now.

144
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,480
I'm just tired. So, so tired.

145
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,040
Mr. Buchner, you're making great progress.

146
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,480
Thank you so very much, Dr. Tenma. I'm glad to hear it.

147
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,980
Do you think I'll be able to work like I used to?

148
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,460
Yes, of course.

149
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,560
Good. Because if I'm not there, I'll have no choice but to close shop.

150
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,920
However, you mustn't overdo it.

151
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,740
I'll stop by your restaurant for a drink after you're released.

152
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,400
And that's just to make sure that you're not overworking.

153
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,720
Say, Dr. Tenma.

154
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,440
Yes?

155
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,920
I heard that you were leaving this hospital.

156
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
Is it true, Doctor?

157
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,760
Don't quit. Please don't quit.

158
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,960
Good doctors like you are so hard to find.

159
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,640
Please stay. Please don't say you're quitting.

160
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,060
Please.

161
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,100
Mr. Buchner...

162
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,840
Dr. Tenma, the chairman is asking for you.

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,860
Right now he's in a meeting with the board discussing how to fill the open positions.

164
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,520
Until now, most of these posts were held by Dr. Heinemann's followers.

165
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,040
It seems like there are going to be major changes.

166
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,300
For example, the rumor is Dr. Eckner is being transferred to a small hospital in Bavaria.

167
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,560
Dr. Tenma, hold on.

168
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,100
No matter what the chairman says, please don't give up.

169
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,260
I want you to know we're all behind you.

170
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,120
So please, don't leave the hospital.

171
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,760
Let me say this again.

172
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,660
I'm performance-oriented, and that's the reason

173
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,400
I'm making you chief of surgery.

174
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,120
What a life.

175
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:39,460
I went against the director's orders and lost my position as chief, and my engagement to

176
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,260
Ava is broken, and then as soon as I decide to work as a regular doctor without hope of

177
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,180
ever being promoted...

178
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:57,240
Oh, God, what a life this is.

179
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,380
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue, but I'd heard you'd been appointed Chief

180
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,080
of Surgery.

181
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm truly happy for you.

182
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,640
- Thank you, Ava.

183
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,240
- Kenzo, that day at my father's funeral,

184
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,520
I remember you were trying to comfort me, weren't you?

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,900
- Uh, well...

186
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,800
- It made me happy.

187
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,140
A lot of things happened between us,

188
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,480
but I'd like to start over.

189
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,860
- [gasps]

190
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,160
Kenzo?

191
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,840
Kenzo!

192
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,100
Listen, please!

193
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,820
Forgive me!

194
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,600
I was wrong!

195
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,740
Let's start over!

196
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,280
Kenzo?

197
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,000
Kenzo!

198
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,580
A patient is hospitalized for a spinal cord tumor.

199
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,800
His paralysis has accelerated.

200
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,640
I understand. I'll do the operation myself.

201
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,940
Excellent, Doctor. I'm glad to hear that.

202
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,740
Make the arrangements for the procedure.

203
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,600
Right!

204
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,280
I've had it with this damn flood.

205
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,820
I thought the world would change when the Berlin Wall came down six years ago.

206
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,060
And it did. For the worse.

207
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,720
It's true.

208
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,260
They talk about a unified Europe, but we just keep getting dumped with the bad.

209
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,720
Yeah. The rate of unsolved crimes is definitely on the rise.

210
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,060
Inspector! We have arrived, sir!

211
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,760
Both victims had their throats slit. It isn't pretty.

212
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,800
Their identities?

213
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Mr. and Mrs. Reichman from Stitch Drive. They were murdered in their home.

214
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,860
We believe they were hidden away in a closet, but were washed out into the open because of the rising floodwaters.

215
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,040
Another middle-aged couple murdered for greed.

216
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,260
In the past two years, there have been four other similar cases across the country.

217
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,100
All murdered the same way. Probably the same thief.

218
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,080
No. It's too premature to call these simple robberies.

219
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,220
Judging from the data, for some reason none of these couples seem to have had any children.

220
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,240
Well, this couple didn't seem to have any children either.

221
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,280
Don't you think there are too many factors in common here

222
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,080
to make the assumption this is just a simple robbery?

223
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,600
Well, sir, I'm just going by the fact that money and goods were taken from all the victims' homes.

224
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,920
It was, all of it totaling a small amount.

225
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,240
Although this would make sense if it were the work of a single perpetrator.

226
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,260
Hold on. You're suggesting there's more than one?

227
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,960
Two of the homes in question had extremely strong locks and sophisticated alarm systems.

228
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,520
But the perpetrator bypassed them and was able to enter without any trouble.

229
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,720
Also, none of the couple showed any signs of struggle before they were killed,

230
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,600
and the neighbors did not hear a single sound at the time the incident took place.

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,580
Don't you think these were orchestrated all too well for just one suspect?

232
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,240
Yeah, maybe.

233
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,040
Do you know this man?

234
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,980
No.

235
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,820
Adolf Junkers, 32 years old.

236
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,300
He's been arrested twice for larceny.

237
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,560
In a robbery, he's the one who gets you through the front door.

238
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,500
In other words, a lockpick.

239
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,880
It turns out, he was spotted near the area in three of those four double murder cases.

240
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,020
Then he's gotta be the man, right?

241
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,980
Or not. It's too early.

242
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,120
Well, in any case, detective, your job here is done.

243
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,860
The BKA will take it from here.

244
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,860
Uh, sure.

245
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:54,400
Well, it didn't fly after all. Sorry about that. I've never flown a kite before in my life. It was good

246
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,960
You almost did it. Well doctor do tell how was your date last night? Oh

247
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,520
She seemed like a nice girl. Come on, dr. Tenma. Don't be coy. She's the daughter of a director

248
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,760
Don't tell me you just had dinner and saw her home

249
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,940
Well, actually there was an emergency call during dinner. So I had to come back to the hospital. Hold on you did what?

250
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,720
Ah, you'd better rethink that all work and no play doctrine.

251
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,400
You're gonna lose a great catch and regret it someday, do you hear me?

252
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,920
Hey, are you listening to a word I'm saying?

253
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,420
Oh, a kite, eh?

254
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,500
Good morning, Doctor. How are you?

255
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,380
Is this yours, Carl?

256
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,400
My grandpa gave it to me.

257
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,760
But it won't fly. I think it's broken.

258
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,080
Maybe the alignment needs to be adjusted.

259
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, Doctor, do you know how to fly a kite?

260
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,100
When I was a kid back in Japan, I used to do this a lot.

261
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,560
Hold it up in the air now. All right, you ready?

262
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,300
How like this that a boy?

263
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,600
Now here we go

264
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,780
It's flying

265
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,780
All right.

266
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,280
Oh, man.

267
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,380
If I were as smooth as that,

268
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,160
I'd have at least five lovers.

269
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,300
Hell, maybe even ten. Seriously.

270
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,920
That's so awesome, Dr. Tenma.

271
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,260
Get better soon, Carl,

272
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,940
so that next time you can fly it yourself, okay?

273
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:27,960
Yeah.

274
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,760
Today's surgery is a paracellar meningioma.

275
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:45,060
extirpation we'll proceed with a right tyrion approach yes everyone watch

276
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,840
closely the chief of surgery himself is heading up this one brilliant operation

277
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,220
just look at that he's hardly retracted the brain at all he is truly a surgical

278
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,700
genius new residents should learn to treat the brain with such care

[TIRES SCREECHING]

282
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,040
This is terrible! An ambulance! Someone call an ambulance!

283
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,220
I didn't do it! This wasn't my fault!

284
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,060
This guy ran into the street all of a sudden out of nowhere!

285
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,700
Is this the patient?

286
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,420
Yes.

287
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,700
How is he?

288
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,960
Well, we... we tried. But there isn't much we can do.

289
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,700
This man is a material witness in a case.

290
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,820
It's important that we get his testimony since it may help us solve a string of serial murders doctor

291
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,420
We can't have him die on us

292
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,760
But inspector this patient is in very critical condition

293
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,620
Really? There's nothing else we can do for him here

294
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:25,180
However, there's a top-notch neurosurgeon at Eisler Memorial Hospital if he comes here. He might be able to do something

295
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,660
neurosurgeon

296
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,480
That would be dr. Tenma

297
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,360
Thanks for coming all the way out here, Dr. Tenma.

298
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,820
What's his condition right now?

299
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,160
He is conscious, but a bit delirious.

300
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,400
Also, one of his pupils is dilated.

301
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,980
It's been a while, hasn't it, Dr. Tenma?

302
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,700
Uh, sorry, but do I know you from somewhere, sir?

303
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,420
It was nine years ago. The director's funeral, remember?

304
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,860
Oh, yes, you were from the BKA.

305
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:03,360
Inspector Lungay, please do be sure to perform a successful operation for the sake of the BKA.

306
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,560
The thing is, Doctor, this patient has to survive. He holds the key to solving a very important case.

307
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,360
Well, Inspector, I don't operate for the sake of the police. I do it for the sake of the patient.

308
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,620
Fair enough, Doctor.

309
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,060
Now if you'll excuse me, I have an operation.

310
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,040
I hear you've become the Chief of Surgery. Well now, Doctor.

311
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,100
You've certainly become very successful.

312
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,920
Yes, and what about it?

313
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,960
Nothing. At your age, it's quite an accomplishment.

314
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,680
Aren't you next in line to become the director?

315
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,300
No. I still have a long way to go.

316
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,980
Those murders years ago at Eisler Memorial Hospital...

317
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,900
Due to a lack of evidence, that investigation has seen very little progress.

318
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,260
The only clue we found was the poisoned candy.

319
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,300
This suggests it was a calculated act on the part of the killer.

320
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,600
In that kind of crime, the killer always has something to gain from the victim's death.

321
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,300
What are you getting at, Inspector?

322
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,360
Nothing. Forgive me.

323
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,120
In my line of work, the mind doesn't stop. I'm always thinking like this.

324
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:15,740
In any case, rest assured, of all the cases I've ever handled throughout my career, not one has gone unsolved.

325
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,600
No, not a single one.

326
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,840
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

327
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,420
We'll perform a craniotomy to remove the hematoma.

328
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,160
If we don't hurry, the brain hernia will worsen.

329
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,260
After the Eisler Memorial Hospital murders, no matter which way I looked at it, one person

330
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,240
had everything to gain from the incident.

331
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,520
And that is you, Dr. Tenma.

332
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,480
Thank you again for going to all this trouble, driving all this way.

333
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,400
No, don't worry. How is the patient responding?

334
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,140
Well, he is still conscious, but his right pupil does remain dilated.

335
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,420
He's also got paralysis on the left side.

336
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,020
But he has already started rehab, hasn't he?

337
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,120
The paralysis should go away. He's on the right track listen

338
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,320
I think the police want to interrogate him as soon as possible, but that's out of the question

339
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,830
But doctor that detective Lungay is a very persistent man right now the patient's recovery is all I'm worried about

340
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,200
How are you feeling Mr.. Yonkers everything okay?

341
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,460
So, tell me, Mr. Junkers, are you able to recognize me?

342
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,080
Do you see this finger I'm holding up?

343
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,420
How about it?

344
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,900
Can you talk to me today?

345
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,300
What's that?

346
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,140
I'm sorry.
