00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,600
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour. We're here on official police business. Would you happen to be Dr. Tenma?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,840
can i help you pardon my asking but were you home all last night what no i i was out drinking until

3
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,280
dawn why'd you ask well sir eisler memorial hospitals director heinemann

4
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:58,720
chief of surgery dr oppenheim and dr boyer they're all dead

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:29,980
We'll be right back.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:59,980
We'll be right back.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:23,960
No one except the police are allowed to enter the scene of the crime.

8
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,660
But you're interfering with the operation of this hospital.

9
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,040
The press is not allowed inside.

10
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,120
We can't have patients in this kind of chaos.

11
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,880
Can you tell us, please?

12
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,660
Was it an accident or was it murder?

13
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,220
Three people died at the same time.

14
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,400
Of course it was murder.

15
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,920
Are you part of the hospital staff?

16
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,420
Tell us.

17
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,520
Would you happen to know anything about this incident?

18
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,280
Out of my way.

19
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:42,980
Let me through.

20
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,180
Hey, no one's allowed in.

21
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,420
I work here.

22
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm Dr. Kenzo Tenma.

23
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,940
Come on, step back.

24
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,460
So, did you see anyone suspicious earlier tonight?

25
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't think this is the time to be...

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,820
Oh, Dr. Tenma.

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Dr. Tenma.

28
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,820
The director and the others?

29
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,560
Calm down, everyone.

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,340
Is the emergency room running smoothly?

31
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,140
Well, actually, we're swamped with emergency cases right now, Doctor.

32
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,660
Two patients are waiting to be operated on.

33
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,500
All right, then. I'll see what I can do.

34
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,440
Can you take care of the car accident victim with the brain contusion?

35
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,440
First, I'll go look over the x-rays.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
How about the other case?

37
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,640
Uh, the patient collapsed with a stroke.

38
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,360
Ah, Doctor, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,840
I don't have time for this.

40
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,620
I understand, but this initial investigation is vital.

41
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,340
Do you know of anyone who could have possibly held a grudge against the director and the others a grudge?

42
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,480
You have successfully tied the noose around your own neck tenma

43
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,560
Doctor did someone come to mind no, sorry

44
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,060
Those kids the twins the boy and the girl they're gone sir, we can't find them anywhere

45
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:06,480
And is the little girl's bed empty as well, Nurse?

46
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,160
I've already checked, but they're both just gone.

47
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,240
What's going on?

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,880
What the hell is going on?

49
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,620
In his mercy, he lent a hand to many who were ill and suffering.

50
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,320
We will always remember his great accomplishments.

51
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,440
Farewell, Dr. Heinemann.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,340
May you rest in peace.

53
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,280
Amen.

54
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,400
Father!

55
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,240
Eva, Eva, I know it's difficult, but please, try to hold yourself...

56
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,260
Don't touch me!

57
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,300
Give me my father back!

58
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,680
I want him back!

59
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,300
I want him back!

60
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:06,520
This whole funeral business is just too sad, Dr. Tenma.

61
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,660
Yeah.

62
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,460
Up until now, she was fed with a silver spoon as the director's daughter.

63
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,380
But now, suddenly, she's just another ordinary person.

64
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,460
That's got to be quite a big shock.

65
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,420
How can you say that right now?

66
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,860
Sorry about that.

67
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,300
Dr. Tenma?

68
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,340
I am Inspector Weisba of the Nordheim Westfalen Police Department.

69
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,700
Thank you for your efforts.

70
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,380
This was such a tragedy.

71
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,300
Yes.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
Let me introduce you. Dr. Tenma?

73
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,660
I am Inspector Lunge. I'm here from the BKA.

74
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,080
I've heard about your amazing abilities, Doctor.

75
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,660
No, I... I still have a long ways to go.

76
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:55,220
um do you have any leads at all to the children's whereabouts no but we have determined the cause

77
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,200
of death for the director and the other two doctors we have discovered traces of nitrate

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,000
inside all three of their bodies so there were traces of nitrate that's a muscle relaxant

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,120
exactly i see you're not a doctor for nothing how could something like that end up and it was candy

80
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,580
Huh? Candy?

81
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,160
It turns out the same candy wrapper was found beside each of the bodies.

82
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,840
The same substance was also found in each of their stomachs.

83
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,020
Tell me, would you have any idea where they might have gotten this candy?

84
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,020
Or something else of that sort?

85
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,580
I wouldn't know where they got it from.

86
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,660
If you don't mind me asking, how is the search for the twins going?

87
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,960
The BKA has taken over jurisdiction on this particular case from the local authorities.

88
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,200
Please don't worry.

89
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,620
As it stands, after investigating certain events, we believe all this could be tied back to the moment the twins' parents were shot to death.

90
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,920
First, their parents defect from East Germany and are murdered soon after that.

91
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,620
Then, staff from the hospital where the children were treated are also murdered.

92
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
Political terrorism may be a possibility.

93
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,360
Those children might hold a major key to this whole mystery.

94
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,080
They need protection. Please do your best to find them, Inspector.

95
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,640
We certainly will.

96
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,220
Excuse us.

97
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:19,480
Interesting. A Japanese doctor demoted by the director,

98
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,400
and then his engagement at the director's daughter broken right before the incident.

99
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,580
But the man was in the bar drinking at the time the crime was committed. It checks out.

100
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,480
Um, mind if I ask you something? Why does your hand move like that?

101
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,740
Oh. Oh, this. I was just typing.

102
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,440
Huh?

103
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,880
I'm inputting all the information onto the hard drive in my head.

104
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,340
And if I access the information...

105
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,560
No, I... I still have a long ways to go.

106
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,520
Dr. Tenma was actually quite modest about it when I commented on his well-recognized talents earlier.

107
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,440
Hmm.

108
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,880
The police, huh? What, are they thinking you're a suspect?

109
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,420
There's enough evidence to implicate me. Nothing I can do about it.

110
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,680
Oh, don't worry about it. They were persistent when they questioned me, too.

111
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,640
God, I'm so exhausted.

112
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,760
Once this whole thing gets settled, I think I'm gonna go back to Japan.

113
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,420
Huh?

114
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I came to Germany to do research, but with everything that's happened, I see again.

115
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,480
The most important thing for a doctor is to save lives.

116
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,320
Come on. Don't get all depressed on me now.

117
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,180
I'm just tired.

118
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,520
I'm so, so tired.

119
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,040
Mr. Buchner, you're making great progress.

120
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,480
Thank you so very much, Dr. Tenma. I'm glad to hear it.

121
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,980
Do you think I'll be able to work like I used to?

122
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,460
Yes, of course.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,560
Good, because if I'm not there, I'll have no choice but to close shop.

124
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,920
However, you mustn't overdo it.

125
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,740
I'll stop by your restaurant for a drink after you're released.

126
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,440
And that's just to make sure that you're not overworking.

127
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Say, Dr. Tenma, I heard that you were leaving this hospital.

128
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,420
Is it true, doctor?

129
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,420
Don't quit. Please don't quit.

130
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,420
Good doctors like you are so hard to find.

131
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Please stay. Please don't say you're quitting.

132
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,420
Please.

133
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,420
Mr. Buchner.

134
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,420
Dr. Tenma, the chairman is asking for you.

135
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,860
Right now, he's in a meeting with the board discussing how to fill the open positions.

136
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,520
Until now, most of these posts were held by Dr. Heinemann's followers.

137
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,060
It seems like there are going to be major changes.

138
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,320
For example, the rumor is Dr. Eckner is being transferred to a small hospital in Bavaria.

139
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,500
I see.

140
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,540
Dr. Tenma, hold on.

141
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,100
No matter what the chairman says, please don't give up.

142
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,260
I want you to know we're all behind you.

143
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,100
So please, don't leave the hospital.

144
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:16,840
Let me say this again. I'm performance-oriented.

145
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,380
And that's the reason I'm making you chief of surgery.

146
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,140
What a life.

147
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,040
I went against the director's orders and lost my position as chief.

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,340
Then my engagement to Ava is broken.

149
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:46,340
And then as soon as I decide to work as a regular doctor without hope of ever being promoted...

150
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:56,760
Oh, God. What a life this is.

151
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,200
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue, but I'd heard you'd been appointed chief of surgery. I'm truly happy for you

152
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,320
Thank you Ava

153
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,500
Kenzo that day at my father's funeral. I remember you were trying to comfort me weren't you?

154
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,280
It made me happy a lot of things happened between us, but I'd like to start over

155
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,200
Kenzo?

156
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,840
Kenzo!

157
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,620
Listen, please! Forgive me! I was wrong!

158
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,740
Let's start over!

159
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,300
Kenzo?

160
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,960
Kenzo!

161
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,580
The patient is hospitalized for a spinal cord tumor.

162
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,680
His paralysis has accelerated I understand I'll do the operation myself excellent doctor. I'm glad to hear that

163
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,520
Make the arrangements for the procedure, right?

164
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
I've had it with this damn flood

165
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,800
I thought the world would change when the Berlin Wall came down six years ago, and it did the worse

166
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,060
It's true. They talk about a unified Europe, but we just keep getting dumped with the bad

167
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,460
Yeah, the rate of unsolved crimes is definitely on the rise

168
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Inspector we have arrived sir

169
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:56,580
Both victims had their throats slit it isn't pretty their identities mr. And mrs. Reichman from stitch drive

170
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
They were murdered in their home

171
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,860
We believe they were hidden away in a closet, but were washed out into the open because of the rising floodwaters.

172
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,020
Another middle-aged couple murdered for greed.

173
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,260
In the past two years, there have been four other similar cases across the country.

174
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,080
All murdered the same way. Probably the same thief.

175
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,060
No. It's too premature to call these simple robberies.

176
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,200
Judging from the data, for some reason none of these couples seem to have had any children.

177
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,180
Well, this couple didn't seem to have any children either.

178
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,280
Don't you think there are too many factors in common here

179
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,060
to make the assumption this is just a simple robbery?

180
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,580
Well, sir, I'm just going by the fact that money and goods were taken from all the victims' homes.

181
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,900
It was, all of it totaling a small amount.

182
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,760
Although this would make sense if it were the work of a single perpetrator.

183
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,280
Hold on. You're suggesting there's more than one?

184
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,960
Two of the homes in question had extremely strong locks and sophisticated alarm systems.

185
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,500
But the perpetrator bypassed them and was able to enter without any trouble.

186
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,720
Also, none of the couple showed any signs of struggle before they were killed,

187
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,600
and the neighbors did not hear a single sound at the time the incident took place.

188
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,580
Don't you think these were orchestrated all too well for just one suspect?

189
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,240
Yeah, maybe.

190
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,040
Do you know this man?

191
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,980
No.

192
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,820
Adolf Junkers, 32 years old.

193
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,300
He's been arrested twice for larceny.

194
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,540
In a robbery, he's the one who gets you through the front door.

195
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,500
In other words, a lockpick.

196
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,880
It turns out, he was spotted near the area in three of those four double murder cases.

197
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,040
Then he's got to be the man, right?

198
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,980
Or not. It's too early.

199
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,120
Well, in any case, Detective, your job here is done.

200
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,860
The BKA will take it from here.

201
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,860
Uh, sure.

202
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,800
Oh, well, it didn't fly after all.

203
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,700
Oh, sorry about that. I've never flown a kite before in my life.

204
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,380
It was good. You almost did it.

205
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,240
Well, Doctor, do tell. How was your date last night?

206
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,920
Oh, well, she seemed like a nice girl.

207
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,080
Come on, Dr. Tenma. Don't be coy.

208
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,520
She's the daughter of a director.

209
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,740
Don't tell me you just had dinner and saw her home.

210
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,940
Well, actually, there was an emergency call during dinner,

211
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,560
so I had to come back to the hospital.

212
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,900
Hold on. You did what?

213
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,680
Ah! You'd better rethink that all work and no play doctrine.

214
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,500
You're gonna lose a great catch and regret it someday.

215
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,560
Do you hear me? Hey, are you listening to a word? I'm saying, huh? Okay day. Good morning, doctor

216
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,960
How are you?

217
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,580
Is this yours Carl? My grandpa gave it to me, but it won't fly. I think it's broken

218
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,300
Maybe the alignment needs to be adjusted. Well doctor

219
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,980
Do you know how to fly a kite when I was a kid back in Japan? I used to do this a lot

220
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,420
Hold it up in the air now. All right, you ready

221
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,260
How like this and a boy now here we go

222
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,260
It's flying

223
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,180
All right, oh

224
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:19,400
Oh, man. If I were as smooth as that, I'd have at least five lovers. Hell, maybe even ten. Seriously.

225
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,940
That's so awesome, Dr. Tenma!

226
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,920
Get better soon, Carl, so that next time you can fly it yourself, okay?

227
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:27,940
Yeah.

228
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,680
Today's surgery is a paracellar meningioma extirpation.

229
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,900
We'll proceed with a right-terrional approach.

230
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,560
Yes.

231
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,520
Everyone watch closely.

232
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,420
The chief of surgery himself is heading up this one.

233
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,840
Brilliant operation.

234
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,780
Just look at that. He's hardly retracted the brain at all.

235
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,780
He is truly a surgical genius.

236
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,620
New residents should learn to treat the brain with such care.

237
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
*Screams in pain*

238
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
*Screams in pain*

239
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,040
This is terrible! An ambulance! Someone call an ambulance!

240
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,220
I didn't do it! This wasn't my fault!

241
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,060
This guy ran into the street all of a sudden out of nowhere!

242
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,720
Is this the patient?

243
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,420
Yes.

244
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,720
How is he?

245
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,960
Well, we... we tried. But there isn't much we can do.

246
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,720
This man is a material witness in a case.

247
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,820
It's important that we get his testimony, since it may help us solve a string of serial murders, Doctor.

248
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,080
We can't have him die on us.

249
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,420
- But Inspector, this patient is in very critical condition.

250
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,400
Really, there's nothing else we can do for him here.

251
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,840
However, there's a top-notch neurosurgeon

252
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,580
at Eisler Memorial Hospital.

253
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,700
If he comes here, he might be able to do something.

254
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,740
- Neurosurgeon, that would be Dr. Tenma.

255
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,440
- Thanks for coming all the way out here, Dr. Tenma.

256
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,520
- What's his condition right now?

257
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,680
- He is conscious, but a bit delirious.

258
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,720
Also, one of his pupils is dilated.

259
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,240
- It's been a while, hasn't it, Dr. Tenma?

260
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,980
- Sorry, but do I know you from somewhere, sir?

261
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,760
- It was nine years ago.

262
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,160
The director's funeral, remember?

263
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
- Oh yes, you were from the BKA.

264
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,940
- Inspector Lungay, please do be sure

265
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,940
to perform a successful operation for the sake of the BKA.

266
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,900
The thing is, doctor, this patient has to survive.

267
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,560
He holds the key to solving a very important case.

268
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,460
Well, Inspector, I don't operate for the sake of the police.

269
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,400
I do it for the sake of the patient.

270
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,600
Fair enough, Doctor.

271
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,080
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an operation.

272
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,580
I hear you've become the chief of surgery.

273
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,100
Well now, Doctor, you've certainly become very successful.

274
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,920
Yes, and what about it?

275
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,960
Nothing. At your age, it's quite an accomplishment.

276
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,680
Aren't you next in line to become the director?

277
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,320
No. I still have a long way to go.

278
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,400
Those murders years ago at Eisler Memorial Hospital,

279
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,900
due to a lack of evidence, that investigation has seen very little progress.

280
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,280
The only clue we found was the poisoned candy.

281
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,300
This suggests it was a calculated act on the part of the killer.

282
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,600
In that kind of crime, the killer always has something to gain from the victim's death.

283
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,300
What are you getting at, Inspector?

284
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,340
Nothing. Forgive me.

285
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,520
In my line of work, the mind doesn't stop.

286
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,120
I'm always thinking like this.

287
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,040
In any case, rest assured,

288
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,040
of all the cases I've ever handled throughout my career,

289
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,740
not one has gone unsolved.

290
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
No, not a single one.

291
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,840
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

292
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,420
We'll perform a craniotomy to remove the hematoma.

293
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,180
If we don't hurry, the brain hernia will worsen.

294
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,240
After the Eisler Memorial Hospital murders,

295
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,340
no matter which way I looked at it,

296
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,240
one person had everything to gain from the incident.

297
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,440
And that is you, Dr. Tenma.

298
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,260
Thank you again for going to all this trouble,

299
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,120
driving all this way no don't worry how is the patient responding well he is

300
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,760
still conscious but his right pupil does remain dilated he's also got paralysis

301
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,220
on the left side but he has already started rehab hasn't he the paralysis

302
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,380
should go away he's on the right track listen I think the police want to

303
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,220
interrogate him as soon as possible but that's out of the question but doctor

304
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,120
that detective lungi is a very persistent man right now the patient's

305
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,920
Recovery is all I'm worried about.

306
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
How are you feeling, Mr. Junkers?

307
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,140
Everything okay?

308
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,460
So, tell me, Mr. Junkers, are you able to recognize me?

309
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,060
Do you see this finger I'm holding up?

310
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,400
How about it?

311
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,900
Can you talk to me today?

312
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,340
What's that?

313
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,780
The monster is coming.

314
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,400
I'm sorry, what did you say?

315
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,000
The monster is coming.

316
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,600
Coming? Mr. Junkers, what's coming?

317
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,100
The monster is coming.

318
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,520
The monster is coming.

319
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,520
The monster?
