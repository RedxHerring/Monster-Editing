I'm here in Dusseldorf, where the East German Trade Commissioner

00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,920
who fled to the West, appeared before the press yesterday

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
along with his family and friends.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,980
Mr. and Mrs. Liebert appeared to be in fine spirits along with their fraternal twins.

13
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,540
Mr. Liebert, what do you think of the West?

14
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,120
Well, being here is really very tough.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:10,900
Huh?

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,260
Now that I've realized I'm free to say whatever I want,

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,480
I'm finding it tough learning to say what's really on my mind.

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,740
Actually, the real answer to that question is easy.

19

Just look at the smiling faces of my wife and children.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,800
Well, looks like your twins have started enjoying their newfound freedom.

21
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,980
You're right. I'm so glad.

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,580
Mr. Liebert, would you care to tell us about your opinion of the situation in the East?

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,380

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,920

Hey, let me see. Open up both your hands.

36
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,780
I should have known. No matter which one I picked, I would have been right.

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,820
That's true.

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,380

It was so different from the towns on our side of the border.

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,600
There were lots of nice places to shop.

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,060

- Yeah, seems it started in a large hall upstairs.

From the way the flames were concentrated up there,

132
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,080
it was probably started with kerosene or gasoline.

133
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,820
- Kerosene?

134
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,700
- Yeah, could have been arson.

is to find Tenma.

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
(dramatic music)

185
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,500
- Because Johan was such a wonderful name.

186
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,340
When I found those two, they had no names.

187
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,740
I decided to give the boy the name "Johan."

188
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,560
That name seemed to awaken something inside him.

189
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,360
Enough. No point in talking about the past.

190
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,320
Let's talk of what we're going to do.

191
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,140
Although I won't live to see tomorrow.

192
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,080
(Groaning)

193
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,480
General.

194
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,020
- General Wolfe, that's enough now.

195
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,400
You need to stop talking.

196
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,180
- Eva Heinemann, Eva Heinemann's with,

197
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,360
she's with people from my organization.

198
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,820
There were four of us who formed our organization.

199
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,400
They were Professor Gielitz, now dead.

200
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,640
Myself and Eva's with the other two members.

201
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,720
They're trying to use Ava as a pawn.

202
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,240
You can't let them.

203
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,920
Whether I'm dead or alive, there's no stopping it.

204
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,120
It's all beginning to spin out of control.

205
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,220
Stop it! Save me, Tenma!

206
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,420
Dr. Tenma!

207
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,620
My first name is Helmut.

208
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,600
I am Helmut Wolf.

209
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,640
All who knew me as Helmut are no longer of this world.

210
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,680
I'd like to hear my name.

211
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,740
Please say it for me.

212
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,940
That is the only proof of my existence.

213
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,860
- Helmut. - My name.

214
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,160
- You're Helmut. You're Helmut Wolf.

215
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,140
That's who you are.

216
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,660
- So this is it.

217
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,740
This is what Johann saw.

218
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:44,100
I see it now, a world without names You're General Volf

219
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,480
(birds chirping)

220
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,320
- Not much left.

221
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,780
And the gate's locked up.

222
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,880
The police probably don't want anyone looking around.

223
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,060
(metal clanging)

224
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,340
It's no use.

225
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,500
Mr. Lipsky, I know how important this place was to you.

226
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,600
It was where you spent time at the book readings as a child, but...

227
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,680
Nina, this place just might have been important for you as well.

228
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,240
Going inside the mansion could have been the key to bringing back your memories.

229
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,140
I had a vision.

230
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:52,600
All of them lying there, people piled up in the mansion's main hall, all dead.

231
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,020
It looks like that vision you had was really true, Nina.

232
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,320
When I saw the news, I knew it.

233
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,460
the bones of 46 people at the Red Rose Mansion.

234
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,780
- Tell me, Nina.

235
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,000
Do you know if it happened like Johan said it did?

236
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,540
- I don't know.

237
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,720
What did my brother Johan say?

238
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,100
Did he see them all get murdered?

239
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,400
What a horrible sight.

240
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,260
If I had been there to see that,

241
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,280
who's to say I wouldn't be a monster myself?

242
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,740
Seeing that would turn anyone into a monster.

243
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,040
- Nina, maybe it's a good thing

244
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:36,220
burned down. I thought seeing this would be more painful. I felt I couldn't keep living

245
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:43,700
if this place didn't exist. But I just don't feel that way anymore. For me, this place

246
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:52,460
is just too full of sad memories. I wasn't a superior pupil, and that was sad. I couldn't

247
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,940
to meet that man's expectations, and that was sad.

248
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,920
If I had met that man's expectations,

249
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,760
then maybe things would have...

250
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,540
Now I see it was better that I didn't.

251
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,200
He didn't need me, he never did.

252
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,260
- Mr. Lipsky, are your parents still alive?

253
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,200
- They are, but I've never really lived

254
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,060
with either of them.

255
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,420
I hope one thing for you,

256
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,020
If your memories end up returning, Nina,

257
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,620
I hope whatever you recall, that they're good ones.

258
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,220
My good memories?

259
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,920
Yes, they do exist.

260
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,800
I do wonder what a good memory is like.

261
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,900
Dr. Tenma told me,

262
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,680
"If you don't have any good memories,

263
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,420
then you make your own."

264
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,020
He said that we should just make some.

265
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
You do it yourself.

266
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,360
(upbeat music)

267
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,840
Deeter, you've got ketchup all over your face.

268
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,020
Well, so do you!

269
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:43,660
Huh?

270
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,240
(laughing)

271
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,400
- Uh, Nina.

272
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,240
I'm in the process of creating

273
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,720
a new puppet show at the moment.

274
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,660
- Great, what is it about?

275
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,000
- For some reason, no one ever feels like

276
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,900
watching the puppet shows that I create.

277
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
I think people might end up finding

278
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,000
this one a bit more interesting.

279
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,360
- Oh please, can we see your play?

280
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,980
- Yeah, yeah, can we see it?

281
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,820
I am a girl who's lost her memory.

282
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,960
I had a dream that I was being chased by a monster.

283
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,820
I had a dream I was chasing a monster.

284
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,960
But I like to sing.

285
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,400
I like to dance, too.

286
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,460
Someday, I'll have a wonderful dream.

287
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,020
Someday, that dream will come true for me.

288
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,000
Someday.

289
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,020
"I can't think of what will come next.

290
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,640
You know, I'd really like to give this girl's story some kind of happy ending.

291
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,560
And yet, I haven't been able to think of one.

292
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,220
But she deserves a happy ending.

293
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,800
I want her to be happy."

294
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,740
"Thank you so much."

295
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,860
The girl made up her mind to leave.

296
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,320
She doesn't know what kind of a journey it will be.

297
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,780
She doesn't know what is waiting for her.

298
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,020
But the girl will courageously continue her journey.

299
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,100
The girl turns and waves her hand again and again,

300
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
again and again.

301
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,940
And then she is gone.

302
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,320
To search for her happy ending.

303
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,240
(dramatic music)

304
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,280
(knocking)

305
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,860
- Nina?

306
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,100
Nina!

307
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,220
Nina, you've come back!

308
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,840
- I've been looking for you.

309
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,380
You're Mr. Lipsky.

310
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:21,360
You're the son of the owner of the Red Rose Mansion and Franz Bonaparta is your father, isn't he?

311
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,780
[MUSIC]

312
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,920
(gentle music)
