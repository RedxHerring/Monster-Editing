1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,680
First came bouquets. So many they wouldn't even fit in my dressing room.

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,520
Next came designer clothes and handbags.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,380
And finally, jewelry with rocks bigger than anything I'd ever seen.

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,120
I never knew who these wonderful gifts were coming from.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,560
"It was you, wasn't it?"

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,280
"I must admit, I felt something special when I saw your show for the first time."

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,980
"Something special? Was it my boobs or my ass?"

8
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,940
"It's something that can't be seen."

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,920
"I wish you had come by my dressing room to meet me in person."

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,120
"What, even someone like me?"

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,120
"Huh? What do you mean?"

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,860
It seems you actually care. I feel you'd really listen to me and I like that.

13
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,680
This is so delicious!

14
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,000
I've never had food this good before!

15
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,560
Have as much as you like.

16
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,300
- It's just incredible.

17
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,380
Does the baby eat like this every night?

18
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,520
- Yes, sometimes the food tastes good

19
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,880
and sometimes it doesn't.

20
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,900
It all depends on the company.

21
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,080
- Do you always have a whole lot of company

22
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,380
surrounding you when you eat?

23
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,860
I'm used to eating meals by myself.

24
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,300
- Yes, there's always a crowd as long as I get to check.

25
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:54,980
- Really?

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
So why do you do it?

27
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,520
- I wonder about that.

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,040
Come to think of it,

29
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,320
no matter how many dining companions I've had

30
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,460
No matter how much they enjoyed themselves, I've always felt like I was eating alone.

31
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,200
And right now?

32
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,220
I'm having a lot of fun.

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,660
Well, that's good.

34
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,320
Do you think we could make this a regular thing? You know, us dining together?

35
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,540
Sure we could. But eating at places like this all the time could be tiring.

36
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,760
It's been strange lately.

37
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,660
Strange?

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,160
The way I'm feeling. I've never felt like this before.

39
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,760
For many years, right here in the city of Frankfurt,

40
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,220
I've worked long hours to build my kingdom.

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,540
I struggled hard and fought many battles to create a new order.

42
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,780
It was my dream to become like the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler.

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,740
I've always had a dream, too.

44
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,000
My dream was to become a famous dancer.

45
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,080
So what I'm doing right now isn't what I thought I'd be doing.

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,460
But everyone seems to be mesmerized when I do my dancing.

47
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,340
It just feels so good when I'm performing.

48
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,280
Huh?

49
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,320
This is the first time in my life I've felt like this.

50
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,760
I'm frightened.

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,720
So what are you trying to say?

52
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,220
Well, it's just that it'sâ€¦

53
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,100
it's about those three murders which have occurred in the past few months.

54
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,600
It's all as Johan wills it.

55
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,600
Yes, so you've said.

56
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,540
I just want to understand.

57
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,620
Now, the reason for the murders of the Bilker investment baker, Fritz Oberth,

58
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,220
and the grocer's daughter, Frieda Schilling, is apparent.

59
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,800
It was to bury scandals.

60
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,860
I understand the necessity of those two particular murders.

61
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,920
However, the foreign trader, Erich Klemperer,

62
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,300
do you know anything about him?

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,740
No, I'm not familiar with him.

64
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,000
He doesn't have anything to do with Johann.

65
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,560
Are you absolutely certain about that?

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,220
Do we know what Johan is trying to achieve?

67
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:03,940
Really?

68
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,920
Or even where he is?

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,260
I can't help but wonder.

70
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,100
Could it be that you're hiding something from me?

71
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,220
- You have no need to worry.

72
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,600
Anyway, the more important question is,

73
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,840
were you able to find Nina?

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,240
- She left the psychologist's house in Munich

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,040
quite suddenly.

76
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,480
is headed to Frankfurt.

77
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,540
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

78
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,180
don't you think that our absolute top priority

79
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,180
should be capturing Nina right now?

80
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,540
- Well, perhaps I'd better jog your memory

81
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,940
about Nina's true nature.

82
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,620
It can't be ignored,

83
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,160
although you might not want to remember,

84
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,640
she is Johan's sister.

85
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,020
- I'll never forget that look in her eyes.

86
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,020
(explosion booms)

87
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,220
That night we tried to burn down the Turkish quarter.

88
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,820
She bore right through me with those eyes

89
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,860
It gives me chills just thinking about it.

90
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,340
Isn't it splendid?

91
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,700
Are you talking about the program you created and set in motion?

92
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,700
I can't take credit. I only hount.

93
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,340
My master actually put it all together.

94
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,000
And it's working.

95
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,900
Everything is proceeding exceptionally well,

96
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,100
according to his program.

97
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,160
Are things really proceeding according to the program, as he says they are?

98
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,860
There it is! Right there! My favorite ice cream truck! This time it's my treat!

99
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,900
Isn't it good? I think they have the best ice cream in Frankfurt.

100
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,900
For the first time in a while, I feel relaxed.

101
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,180
Lately, it's felt as though there's been a dark cloud over me.

102
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,460
Why's that?

103
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,880
Yes, I wonder why.

104
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,400
It's really not at all necessary to have someone guarding me.

105
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,140
Nevertheless, young man, those are Mr. Chapek's orders.

106
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,680
I'm telling you, there's no need to worry.

107
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,900
Believe me, even if I'm outside, walking up and down the street,

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,100
there really aren't many people who know who I am.

109
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,380
That's right.

110
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,920
But it will cause us a lot of grief if you do whatever you want again.

111
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,440
That's why we can't let you.

112
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,500
What makes you think I did whatever I wanted?

113
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,580
Three people had to be killed unnecessarily to cover up your scandals.

114
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,380
How many do you think I can kill before they find out?

115
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,620
Just who do you think is responsible for affording you that luxury?

116
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,460
"The four leaders of the organization, Professor Giedlitz, General Wolf, Mr. Chapek, not to

117
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,040
mention your main supporter, your deceased father, you seem to think that you have succeeded

118
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,420
to your father's post by right of birth, but actually it isn't that simple.

119
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,060
What matters is whether or not you can prove yourself worthy of the post."

120
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,020
"What, are you trying to say that you should have been the one appointed to that leadership

121
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,380
You've been surrounded by a lot of scandal.

122
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,280
And I know the details about every bit of it.

123
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,680
Well, you know what they say happens to people who know too much.

124
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,200
Secrets have to be kept.

125
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,600
Wait till you're out of your diapers before you try and threaten me.

126
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,000
I have no intention of becoming your enemy.

127
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,120
Not so long as you're Frankfurt's leading right winger.

128
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,160
(Footsteps)

129
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,420
Hmph.

130
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,040
(Chuckles)

131
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,360
I had fun.

132
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,680
Me too.

133
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm glad I was able to talk to you today.

134
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,200
I rather enjoyed it.

135
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,460
You can talk to me whenever you want.

136
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,560
You know, it's been quite a long time

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,040
since I've actually walked around Frankfurt like this

138
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,700
without a bodyguard beside me.

139
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,280
Alright. Want me to walk you home?

140
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,440
You? Walk me home?

141
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,200
You want to be my bodyguard, is that what you're saying?

142
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,380
I'm fine, really. That's the hotel where I live, right over there.

143
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,900
My goodness! You actually live in a hotel?

144
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,200
Here you go. I hope this'll do.

145
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,520
I don't want it.

146
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,340
Goodbye.

147
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, I'm so sorry. It's just a habit of mine. I apologize!

148
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,860
I've always done that. Bought people with fistfuls of cash.

149
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,680
Listen, maybe we could...

150
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,040
go up to your room?

151
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,060
I know that people always call you "The Baby,"

152
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,900
but what is your real name?

153
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,940
Well, actually, my name is...

154
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,700
Yes, we just now found out where his twin sister is.

155
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,400
Let him know but he's not answering

156
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,400
I'm on my way to his room as we speak. Yeah. All right

178
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,080
You're looking a little bit pale to me.

179
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,440
Well, please forgive the rude question

180
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,840
I'm about to ask you, but we need to know

181
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,300
if you were the one who ordered the baby to be killed, sir.

182
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,920
- What an absurd question.

183
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,900
- Please understand, we're just asking to make sure.

184
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,420
In this day and age, by the crack of dawn,

185
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,980
news reports of the baby's death

186
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,540
and with the death of this important man,

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,520
the balance within the organization

188
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,320
might just suddenly fall apart.

189
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,820
It's hard to predict,

190
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,860
but I'm guessing things will get messy.

191
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,640
We will carry out the job we were assigned to do.

192
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,960
We thought that job was to protect you.

193
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:45,980
However,

194
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,220
if you were the one who had the baby killed,

195
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,460
then guarding you will no longer

196
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,940
be in our best interests.

197
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,700
I summoned the two of you

198
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,660
when I heard the news.

199
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,080
Why on earth would I do such a thing

200
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,760
if I had ordered the baby killed.

201
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,960
Good point.

202
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,580
So now you're afraid you might be the next target.

203
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,380
Since you're telling us you had nothing to do with his murder,

204
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,040
do you have any idea of who did?

205
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,860
Do we know what Johan is trying to achieve?

206
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,100
Really? Or even where he is?

207
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,000
What am I afraid of?

208
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:36,680
everything is proceeding according to the plan everything is proceeding

209
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:43,800
according to the program fine but for now we need to move you to a safe

210
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,140
location do you have one that you can suggest well I do have a mountain villa

211
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,740
in Idstein. Luckily, I've never told anyone about it. I should be safe. I can stay there

212
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,240
for a while. Anyway, what about the twin sister? Right before all of this happened, you said

213
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,340
you knew where she was.

214
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:06,280
Yes. She recently arrived here in Frankfurt. She's staying at the Toulette, a cheap hotel.

215
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,080
Capturing and securing this woman in a locked room somewhere will ensure my safety, at least

216
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,960
for the time being.

217
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,840
Hm?

218
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,120
Right. First thing tomorrow morning-

219
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,340
- You'll do it right now!

220
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,500
- Very well, sir.

221
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,160
(screaming)

222
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,120
- I've contacted two other professional guards

223
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,160
that work with us and told them to meet us

224
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,400
at your villa in Ichstein.

225
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,480
- That's fine.

226
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
- Last night, for some inexplicable reason,

227
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,980
the baby sent away his bodyguard and went off on his own.

228
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,280
You have us.

229
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,520
We'll take care of you.

230
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,300
Don't worry.

231
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,660
Very well.

232
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,760
You didn't even get a scratch on you the other day at the convention center when that guy

233
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,600
was shooting at you.

234
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,440
You're a lucky man, sir.

235
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:09,600
Milan, Milan, listen, I've met a wonderful man.

236
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,060
(ominous music)

237
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,960
- Pleased to meet you.

238
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,040
I'm Peter Chappick.

239
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,980
You've shown me something utterly amazing and wonderful.

240
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,880
I'm talking about your book readings.

241
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm really eager to learn.

242
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,000
Could you tell me more about them?

243
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,800
If I may, I have a few questions on the new, hmm?

244
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,200
This is a good read.

245
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,300
(ominous music)

246
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,260
All the answers are in these books.

247
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,220
How beautiful.

248
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,300
My word, what beautiful children.

249
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,820
So these are the special children

250
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,640
who have been selected to lead the future of humanity.

251
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,140
According to Franz Bonaparte's plan, they are the ones.

252
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,260
Stop! Stop the car right now!

253
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,940
Is something the matter? I believe we're almost there. Your villa should be right at the end

254
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,500
of this road.

255
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,040
What did you say earlier?

256
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:36,640
Sir?

257
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,220
Something about hiring two other guards.

258
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes, I told them to meet us.

259
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,080
And for all I know, they might have already arrived there.

260
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,720
Can they be trusted?

261
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,960
Is there any chance they could have told someone where they were going?

262
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,560
Huh?

263
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,680
Think about it.

264
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,560
Can you assure me beyond a doubt that they haven't leaked information that I'm heading to my villa up in the mountains?

265
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,840
Don't worry.

266
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,660
I promise you they're two very trustworthy people.

267
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,860
I've decided not to go there after all.

268
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,360
What?

269
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,320
This doesn't make a bit of sense.

270
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,720
So where are you going to go then?

271
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,460
I don't know, but we're definitely not going up to the villa.

272
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,760
Look, I don't see the point of driving around all night not knowing where we're going.

273
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,940
That is an order!

274
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,760
I know that you're feeling scared and threatened, but...

275
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,700
I think we should just go to your villa.
