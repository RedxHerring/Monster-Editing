00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,640
I'm thinking it was that sweet-looking blond boy I saw in Dusseldorf a year ago.

10
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,100
Because I've seen Johan, this is how it ends up.

11
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,520
That's how it works with you.

12
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,380
It was dark and raining when I heard those three gunshots.

13
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,060
I was there alone and got scared, so I ran away.

14
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,200
At the time, I was pretty certain it was Tenma who'd been shot dead.

15
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,800
But the next day, there was this big article in the newspaper

16
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,280
saying that a man named Junkers had been found dead in the same location

17
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,080
and that he'd been shot three times.

18
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,900
So then that boy did it, didn't he?

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,960
Might want to rethink pulling that trigger.

20
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,560

If I die, I've arranged for that photo you want so much

to be delivered directly to the BKA.

26
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,620

Heckle may look more like a pickpocket,

but he's actually quite the chef, don't you agree?

Hey, and what in the hell did you mean by that?

80
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,040
This, my friends, is chicken meringue.

81
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,000
The key to the dish is the sauce.

82
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,260
You have to get it just right.

83
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,100
It's based on a recipe from a three-star French restaurant

84
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,360
called Le Petit Mess--

85
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,380
We don't care how it's made, just how it tastes.

86
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,100

87

the subtleties of fine cuisine.

88
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,160
You know, this would taste even better

89
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,520
with a dash of soy sauce.

90
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,920
Soy sauce? Not that again.

91
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,800
You put soy sauce on everything.

92
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,260
Now, this is dining.

93
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,300
When you sit down to eat, this is how it should be.

94
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,540
What a waste.

95
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,100
All my life, everything I did was to make money.

96
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,460
But while I was earning all those millions,

97
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,420
I lost things much more valuable.

98
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,440
Both of my parents and my only brother disowned me.

99
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,740
Even my wife and son were murdered.

100
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,600
I always wanted to live peacefully

101
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
and dine like we're doing right now.

102
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,860
Money can really change the way people act.

103
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,680
Allow me to share a good example with you.

104
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,480
Five years ago, a covert banking organization was formed

105
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,440
to facilitate the underground funds flowing throughout Germany.

106
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,840
What these guys pulled off was absolutely amazing.

107
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,380
Within days of the dirty money flowing in through shady companies,

108
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,600
it would come out the other side perfectly clean.

109
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,060
Ah, a money laundering operation.

110
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:06,900
Exactly.

111
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,360
On top of that, this organization functioned in many ways like a real bank,

112
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,740
making loans and investing in speculative transactions.

113
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,280
And it grew unbelievably fast.

114
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,560
In five short years, they'd made a fortune.

115
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,680
Hot damn!

116
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,680
But that all changed this year,

117
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,640
suddenly vanished. He hasn't been seen in months and no one knows where he went. Guess

118
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:38,600
what happened then? All of it fell apart. The entire operation imploded. The associates

119
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,860
that remained started fighting over who would get what was left and who would be in charge.

120
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,780
Most of them ended up killing each other and the entire operation disappeared. If only

121
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,020
They'd been sensible and talk things out while sharing a fine dinner

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,560
So

123
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,180
You think that guy got murdered or did he just run off?

124
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:11,180
Huh? Keep up doc. I mean the head honcho guy who disappeared so kidnapped murdered. What do you think? Oh, no

125
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,060
I'm quite sure he's still alive

126
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,280
In fact, he might even be posing as a student somewhere a student

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,380
That's right. I forgot to tell you. I left out something important.

128
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,840
According to my sources, the guy who created that money laundering organization five years ago was just a kid.

129
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,020
Fifteen years old.

130
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,060
Fifteen years old? Your sources must be nuts.

131
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,440
No way a kid could pull off something like that.

132
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,380
But it's true. This kid did it.

133
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,240
It's as if he was conducting his own experiment to see how adults deal with money.

134
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,720
As though he were a child, playing around with a line of ants.

135
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,020
Where was all this?

136
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,180
Do you know where this covert banking operation was based?

137
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,260
The organization was headquartered in Dusseldorf, but the kid at the top was constantly on the

138
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,560
move.

139
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,260
He controlled the entire operation from wherever he was, you know?

140
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,180
And did anybody figure out the last place that he was seen before he disappeared?

141
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,380
That's all the details I know, but I heard right after their young boss went missing,

142
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,120
all of his money-hungry underlings went rushing to Munich.

143
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,900
To Munich, eh?

144
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,100
Hey, Doc, why the long face, huh? What's going on?

145
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,940
I know. Let's invite that man down the hill up here for lunch.

146
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,960
Sure. Why not? That's a good idea.

147
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,040
Sorry, Doctor, but that man's my bodyguard.

148
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,500
He needs to stay down there.

149
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,960
But haven't you been officially declared dead already?

150
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,380
You still think there are people out there who want to do you harm?

151
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,340
Are you planning to live the rest of your life in fear?

152
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,400
Hiding behind a bodyguard?

153
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,100
Helmut has been with me for a very long time, indeed.

154
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,880
Go ahead, son. Go and get Helmut.

155
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,000
So that's his name. He wouldn't talk to me at all.

156
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,520
I bet. Go and tell him that his duties as my bodyguard are over.

157
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,040
He's the only one left who's like family to me.

158
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Ask him to join us.

159
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,400
Have him come here so we can discuss our future at this table.

160
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,160
Okay!

161
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,280
Mr. Helmut! Lunchtime! They want you to come up and join us!

162
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,960
Temma's right up there in the mountain villa.

163
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,440
You do want to kill him, don't you?

164
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,220
(phone ringing)

165
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
- Is something the matter?

166
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,960
- That was a security breach signal from Helmut.

167
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,760
Unfortunately, I think he's already dead.

168
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,840
- Wait, someone's coming after ya?

169
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,120
- There's no tellin', but I'd say someone's

170
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,820
heading up here even as we speak.

171
