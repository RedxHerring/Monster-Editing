You saw Johan, huh?

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,760
Guess I'll have to kill you.

3
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:26,300
We'll be right back.

To be continued...

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,320
This is how it ends up. That's how it works with you.

10
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,320
It was dark and raining when I heard those three gunshots.

11
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,320
I was there alone and got scared, so I ran away.

12
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,320
At the time, I was pretty certain it was Tenma who'd been shot dead.

13
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,320
But the next day, there was this big article in the newspaper

14
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,320
saying that a man named Junkers had been found dead in the same location

15
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,320
and that he'd been shot three times.

16
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,320
So then that boy did it, didn't he?

17
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,980
Might want to rethink pulling that trigger.

18
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,560
If you kill me, you'll never get what you really want.

19
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,740
That photograph you've been looking for, the one of Johan as a young boy.

20
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,200
Let me tell you what will happen if you do decide to kill me.

21
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,380
If I die, I've arranged for that photo you want so much to be delivered directly to the BKA.

22
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,600
If you want to see that photograph, you need to tell me exactly where Tenma can be found.

23
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:50,400
I just what is so funny your whole body's quivering

24
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,260
you talk tough but your legs are shaking so hard you can barely stand

25
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:11,680
you really do amuse me i'll tell you where he is so what is ten ma up to now oh he's still

26
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,060
working as a doctor but our friend has gone underground where is he there's this older guy

27
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,880
in hanover who was the number two man in a certain organized crime family well this guy's boss kind

28
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,140
of freaked out and put out a hit on him, but the job got botched. The guy got all shut

29
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:35,200
up, but he didn't die. September's at this remote alpine estate, patching him up. It's

30
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,820
up on a mountain near Fusen.

31
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:06,120
Excuse me, but why do you just stand there like that?

32
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,180
Hey, mister, it's almost time for lunch.

33
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,640
Why in the world are we eating outside?

34
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,120
I just thought, the weather looks so nice this afternoon.

35
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,980
Why not mix up our routine and eat outside?

36
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,060
Well, have our lunch out here?

37
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,300
Dieter, go ahead and bring the plates out here.

38
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,220
Okay.

39
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,240
All your wounds are healing nicely, and this fresh air will do you good.

40
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:57,320
i have to say doctor if you hadn't been there i doubt i would have made it that country clinic

41
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,360
was pathetic but the masterful skills you possess allowed you to save my life maybe the one bullet

42
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,720
just grazed your head and the other one went into your leg and passed through cleanly just be

43
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:16,240
thankful it didn't catch your femoral artery to be honest you were quite lucky lucky huh right

44
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,240
All righty guys lunch is served. Wow that smells good heckle

45
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Surprising isn't it? It tastes delicious

46
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,340
Heckle may look more like a pickpocket, but he's actually quite the chef. Don't you agree?

47
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,340
Hey, and what in the hell did you mean by that?

48
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,100
This my friends is chicken morango. The key to the dish is the sauce. You have to get it just right

49
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,340
It's based on a recipe from a three-star French restaurant called Le Petit Besson.

50
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,380
We don't care how it's made, just how it tastes.

51
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,540
A runt like you just can't appreciate the subtleties of fine cuisine.

52
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,520
You know, this would taste even better with a dash of soy sauce.

53
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,920
Soy sauce? Not that again.

54
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,900
You put soy sauce on everything. I give up.

55
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,240
Now this is dining.

56
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,240
When you sit down to eat, this is how it should be.

57
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,540
What a waste.

58
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,100
All my life, everything I did was to make money.

59
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,420
But while I was earning all those millions, I lost things much more valuable.

60
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,440
Both of my parents and my only brother disowned me.

61
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,720
Even my wife and son were murdered.

62
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,240
I always wanted to live peacefully and dine like we're doing right now.

63
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,860
Money can really change the way people act.

64
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,660
Allow me to share a good example with you.

65
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:54,400
Five years ago, a covert banking organization was formed to facilitate the underground funds flowing throughout Germany.

66
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,740
What these guys pulled off was absolutely amazing.

67
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,600
Within days of the dirty money flowing in through shady companies, it would come out the other side perfectly clean.

68
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Ah, a money laundering operation.

69
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,900
Exactly.

70
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,360
On top of that, this organization functioned in many ways like a real bank,

71
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,740
making loans and investing in speculative transactions.

72
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,280
And it grew unbelievably fast.

73
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,580
In five short years, they'd made a fortune.

74
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,680
Hot damn!

75
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,680
But that all changed this year,

76
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,420
because the man who'd been running the show suddenly vanished.

77
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,340
He hasn't been seen in months, and no one knows where he went.

78
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,680
Guess what happened then?

79
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,680
All of it fell apart.

80
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,800
The entire operation imploded.

81
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:42,860
The associates that remained started fighting over who would get what was left and who would be in charge.

82
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,300
Most of them ended up killing each other, and the entire operation disappeared.

83
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,720
If only they'd been sensible and talked things out while sharing a fine dinner.

84
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,160
So, you think that guy got murdered, or did he just run off?

85
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,240
Huh?

86
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,460
Keep up, Doc. I mean the head honcho guy who disappeared.

87
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,100
So kidnapped murdered. What do you think? Oh, no

88
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:19,260
I'm quite sure he's still alive. In fact, he might even be posing as a student somewhere a student

89
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,320
That's right, I forgot to tell you I left out something important

90
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,740
According to my sources the guy who created that money laundering organization five years ago was just a kid

91
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
15 years old

92
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Fifteen years old? Your sources must be nuts. No way a kid could pull off something like that.

93
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:52,540
But it's true, this kid did it. It's as if he was conducting his own experiment to see how adults deal with money.

94
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,540
As though he were a child playing around with a line of ants.

95
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,540
Where was all this? Do you know where this covert banking operation was based?

96
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,320
the organization was headquartered in Dusseldorf but the kid at the top was

97
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,700
constantly on the move he controlled the entire operation from wherever he was

98
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,800
you know and did anybody figure out the last place that he was seen before he

99
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,420
disappeared that's all the details I know but I heard right after their young

100
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,760
boss went missing all of his money-hungry underlings went rushing to

101
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:32,200
Munich to Munich a hey doc why the long face huh what's going on I know

102
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,940
Let's invite that man down the hill up here for lunch.

103
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,000
Sure, why not? That's a good idea.

104
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,460
Sorry, Doctor, but that man's my bodyguard. He needs to stay down there.

105
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,960
But haven't you been officially declared dead already?

106
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,360
You still think there are people out there who want to do you harm.

107
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,340
Are you planning to live the rest of your life in fear?

108
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,400
Hiding behind a bodyguard?

109
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,140
Hmm.

110
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:14,980
Helmut has been with me for a very long time indeed go ahead son go and get Helmut so that's

111
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,160
his name he wouldn't talk to me at all I bet go and tell him that his duties as my bodyguard are

112
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:30,220
over he's the only one left who's like family to me ask him to join us have him come here so we

113
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,920
We can discuss our future at this table.

114
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,760
- Okay.

115
00:11:33,760 --> 00:12:00,880
Mr. Helmut! Lunchtime!

116
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,280
They want you to come up and join us!

117
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,980
Temma's right up there in the mountain villa.

118
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,440
You do want to kill him, don't you?

119
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,520
Is something the matter?

120
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,020
That was a security breach signal from Helmut.

121
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,620
Ah.

122
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Unfortunately, I think he's already dead.

123
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Wait, someone's coming after you?

124
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,760
There's no telling, but I'd say someone's heading up here even as we speak.

125
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Mr. Helmut, sir!

126
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,160
Go tell him.

127
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,940
You have to tell him to run away.

128
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,740
Hurry, go and tell Tenma now.

129
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
Tell him, damn it!

130
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,180
Lady!

131
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,620
I said go tell him!

132
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,560
But your leg! You've been shot!

133
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,040
Don't worry about me! Go!

134
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,040
Hang on! Who's shooting at us?

135
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,100
Did you get him?

136
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,200
I'm not sure, but now's your chance to run for it.

137
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,020
Get going.

138
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,300
But I can't go.

139
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,720
You're out here in the open.

140
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,200
I can help you.

141
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,180
Listen, I can handle this.

142
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,820
Just go.

143
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,980
No, you can't.

144
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,320
We need to go and hide.

145
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:21,940
Quick.

146
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,580
Well, well.

147
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,640
Looks like I was wrong.

148
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,640
She didn't want to kill Temma after all.

149
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:40,320
you gonna be all right ma'am i'll be fine but i think he's already heading up the hill on his

150
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,460
way to the villa not a chance i would have seen him from here there's really only one path to get

151
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,180
all the way up to that house what are you talking about i've explored this whole mountain and this

152
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,700
path is the only way up there all the other paths lead to cliffs no one can climb so then if we guard

153
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,820
this trail, there's no other way Roberto will be able to get far enough up the mountain to get to

154
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:06,540
the villa. You mean you know this guy? I know him too well. Roberto's after Tenma and he wants to

155
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,700
kill him. You know Tenma? So who are you, ma'am? Are you a friend of his?

156
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,520
What you laughing about, ma'am? Don't make me sound so old. Stop calling me ma'am.

157
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,940
Now get out of here, kid.

158
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,540
You get up there and tell Tenma.

159
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,100
Tell him to run away quick.

160
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,280
But, but, ma'am, I mean lady, you're bleeding.

161
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,440
I'll be all right.

162
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,160
You just get up there and warn him.

163
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,160
But your leg looks like it's bleeding a lot.

164
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,360
Tenma must have heard those gunshots.

165
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,820
I bet he's headed down here to take care of that guy.

166
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,060
But that's not good.

167
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,340
Roberto wants Tenma to come down here and try to save us so he can kill him.

168
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,680
Don't you see?

169
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,900
It's a trap, and we're the bait to bring him here.

170
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,620
But what can we do, ma'am?

171
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,620
- Ma'am, if we try to make a run for it with your leg,

172
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,780
you might bleed to death.

173
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,300
- Stop calling me ma'am, what did I tell you?

174
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,800
So just what are you to Tenma anyway?

175
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,860
- I'm his friend.

176
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,000
What about you, I mean lady?

177
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,140
Aren't you a friend of Tenma's too?

178
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,460
You must be, 'cause even though you're hurt really bad,

179
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,060
you're still trying to save him.

180
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,580
I'm not trying to be nosy, but you like Tenma, don't you?

181
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,700
- Are you his girlfriend?

182
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,500
- You just keep watching that side.

183
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,760
Do you like Tenma?

184
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,580
- Yeah, I like him a whole lot.

185
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,060
- What exactly do you like about him?

186
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,460
- Lots of things.

187
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,860
What do you like about him?

188
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,940
- I know you're there.

189
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,200
Crawl around all you want,

190
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,340
but you'd be pretty stupid to shoot me again.

191
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:56,340
I already told you! If I die, that picture of Johan as a child that you want so badly will automatically be sent straight to the BKA!

192
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,840
I mean it! This is your last warning!

193
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,840
If you ever want to see that photo, then you'd better get the hell out of here right now!

194
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,840
So that photo you've got is something he really wants?

195
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
It's a lie.

196
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
Huh?

197
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,340
And it might not work. He's too smart to fall for such a... trick.

198
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,340
Lady, are you feeling alright?

199
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,480
I'm starting to fade. I've lost a lot of blood

200
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,420
Now go

201
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,780
Well, get out of here save yourself. I can't just leave you ten was on his way

202
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,740
He would have been here by now. He's got to be headed here. I mean it

203
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,040
Look, there's no way he would ever come to save me

204
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
Nothing but a waste of time

205
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,360
Deeter!

206
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,020
Deeter, where are you?

207
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,180
Tenma, I'm over here!

208
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,540
Just stay there!

209
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,040
I'm coming to get you, Deeter!

210
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,500
Don't move!

211
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,940
If you try to come get us, there's a man here that's going to shoot you.

212
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,200
That's why he's come here, Tenma, to kill you!

213
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Wait, I know that voice, but it can't be...

214
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,880
- Tenma, this lady's a friend of yours.

215
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,440
She's been shot and she's bleeding a lot.

216
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,120
- It's Eva.

217
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,660
- You can't die now, not when I'm so close.

218
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,540
I'm handing you over to the police, Kenzo,

219
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,380
so you can rot in jail for the rest of your life.

220
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,640
You hear me?

221
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,760
You've got decades of suffering ahead of you.

222
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,580
I want every waking moment to hurt for dumping me.

223
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,880
- Stop shouting, you're straining yourself.

224
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,700
Hey, Dieter! Just tell me if you can hear me, okay?

225
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,200
Can you tell where the shooter is?

226
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
No, I don't know!

227
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I've got no clue where he is, or even if he's still here!

228
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Stop yelling to him.

229
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I need Tenma alive.

230
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Hang in there. He's getting close.

231
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
He's not coming, Dieter. You're wrong.

232
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
He would never come to my rescue.

233
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
It's all over for me.

234
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Don't die, please!

235
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Why would he ever want to rescue me?

236
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:54,560
Kenzo.

237
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,580
What's all this? Why'd you bring me out here?

238
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,260
It's time for lunch.

239
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,900
Your leg has been healing up nicely.

240
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,020
And I thought you'd enjoy eating lunch outside in this beautiful sunshine.

241
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,680
You're a lucky woman, you know.

242
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,280
What do you mean, lucky?

243
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,860
Just that.

244
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,340
The guy who shot you was a real pro.

245
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,560
He knew what he was doing.

246
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,880
He understood how difficult it would be for him to infiltrate this mountain villa.

247
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,520
There's only one path to get up here.

248
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,940
And there are security cameras everywhere.

249
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,760
He also knew this villa would be guarded by experienced men,

250
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,600
so it would be like he was attacking an alpine fortress.

251
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,820
That was the reason he used you.

252
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,580
Hold on. What do you mean he used me?

253
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,720
It's simple.

254
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,480
He must have figured that a pretty woman making an unexpected visit

255
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,660
would have a much better chance of getting all the way up here than he would.

256
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,540
But when you betrayed him, his whole plan was sunk.

257
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,680
He had no plan B. There were no other options for him.

258
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,340
So he got out of here quick and cut his losses.

259
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,140
So then he got away.

260
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,700
That's right. We searched the whole mountain.

261
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,760
This here's a special dish. It's called Chicken Marengo.

262
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,760
I tried to recreate the recipe, but I can't guarantee it'll be any good.

263
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,760
You know, there's another way you were very lucky.

264
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,760
You were lucky to have a great doctor like Dr. Tenma treating you.

265
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
So is Tenma still here?

266
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,760
No. He already left.

267
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Where to?

268
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,260
Think he said something about going to Munich.

269
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,960
Munich, eh?

270
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,280
All right. Let's see if you and I can enjoy this chicken.

271
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,820
I got a feeling you're like me.

272
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,700
I bet it's been a long time since you sat down and enjoyed a meal in peace.
