Don't worry. See? I'm drinking it too.

What happened to the bodyguards? They're supposed to be here for me.

Why did you do it? Why did you murder the baby?

I don't get it. We're all on the same side.

00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,360
You... you were helping us. That was always the plan.

16

We... we said we would look for your sister and hand her over to you.

Well, your precious sister is already in our custody.

He said you weren't an ordinary girl.

For us. He died for us. Milan tried to avenge us.

157
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,840
That's a promise, Christophe Zivernisch.

158
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,720
I researched you. It wasn't that difficult.

159
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,840
After all, your late father, Ernest, was well-known.

160
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,780
Once I found that connection, it was easy, and in Frankfurt,

161
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,300
well, in all of Germany,

162
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,380
the financial power of the Zivernisch Group is well-known.

163
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,680
What a shock that you were the heir to that empire.

164
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,740
And Peter Czapek, he has brought you and Johan together.

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,160
What will happen because I made it possible for you to meet that devil?

169
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,240
You're wrong. You're mistaken.

170
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,180
Tell me how I'm wrong!

171
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,880
Czapek thinks that he introduced us to each other, but the joke's on him.

172
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,140
You see, Johan and I, we've known each other for quite a long time.

173
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,560
What are you talking about?

174
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,260
Czapek doesn't realize the truth.

175
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,120
We became friends when we were much younger.

176
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,200
It was in East Berlin over ten years ago.

177
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,960
You two met ten years ago, over in East Berlin?

178
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,960
I was actually adopted by Zivernisch.

179
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,000
It's a strange tale.

180
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,800
I was secretly sold to their family by a smuggler.

181
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:57,960
You see, Johann and I first met each other in East Berlin's 5-1-1 Kinderheim.

182
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,060
5-1-1 Kinderheim?

183
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,800
We trusted each other, became friends, and we survived.

184
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,020
He and I were the only ones that survived.

185
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,600
I'm scared.

186
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,960
I'm so hungry...

187
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,560
I really need to pee.

188
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,540
Do you think the killing has stopped?

189
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,580
I wonder if everyone is dead.

190
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,000
I bet they are. All of them.

191
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,160
Then let's go outside.

192
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,240
Huh?

193
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,220
Come on, why not?

194
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,020
It's been pretty quiet out there for a long time.

195
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,300
Go out and check! If we stay in here much longer, we'll all go crazy.

196
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,380
Right. I'll... I'll go take a look.

197
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Don't leave us behind. Come back and tell us if things are okay.

198
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:14,340
I don't know why it happened, but all the people who were at 511 Kinderheim went mad that day.

199
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,760
Not just the children went mad. The teachers started killing each other, too.

200
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,820
He hasn't come back.

201
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
He must have run away.

202
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,480
Really?

203
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,940
Yeah. He left us here and ran off.

204
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:34,960
You think?

205
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,700
He tried to save himself.

206
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,520
You mean that?

207
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,900
If you think I'm lying, go and check.

208
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,980
He's out somewhere. Probably relaxing and eating a nice warm meal.

209
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:49,780
Yeah.

210
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,760
Do you really think so?

211
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,160
Then I'm going to take a quick look around.

212
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,560
You won't betray me and abandon me here, will you?

213
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,460
Of course I won't.

214
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,980
He never came back either. But I continued to wait it out.

215
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm going to stay in here and stay safe.

216
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,760
Starved and parched with thirst, I fell in and out of a light sleep.

217
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,800
Am I just gonna die like this?

218
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:46,460
"And then, there he stood."

219
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,800
"It's just you and me. Come with me, I have a plan."

220
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,400
"And that was Johan?"

221
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:05,760
"It's outrageous that Chapa keeps saying that all of this is his plan. Johan and I talked about it constantly back then."

222
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,540
What is this plan of his?

223
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,060
So, you want to hear it?

224
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,300
Well, do you?

225
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,880
You can't do that!

226
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,540
You can't just shoot off my ear!

227
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,540
The way my face looks is very important for a politician!

228
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,360
I've made a mistake. I'm going to be a leader and rule the world, right?

229
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,420
You hear me? We're a team.

230
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,260
Johan's going to make the world mine!

231
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,180
'Cause that's the plan!

232
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,580
What are you going to do about my ear?

233
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,820
I'm not letting anyone ruin our plan!

234
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,380
I won't let you!

235
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,240
Drop your gun!

236
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,360
Kenzo...

237
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:06,980
[Gasp]

238
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,240
[Scream]

239
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,820
Johan told me what to say when you arrived.

240
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,180
He said, "If my sister comes, tell her where I am."

241
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,000
Then he said, "That you would probably kill me."

242
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,640
Those were his very words.

243
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,000
"Tell me, why haven't you killed me by now?"

244
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,660
Your memories, have all of them come back to you?

245
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,340
They have.

246
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,560
Why don't you kill me then?

247
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,740
Do you even know?

248
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,860
How it must fill you, the hatred, the anger, the grief, how do you keep that at bay?

249
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,700
What are we? You know, don't you? Explain it to me.

250
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,900
I've heard about it.

251
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,880
I've heard the stories about how you twins were brought into this world.

252
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,700

253
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,420
[MUSIC]

254
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,200
(upbeat music)
