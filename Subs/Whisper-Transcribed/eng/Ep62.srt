- It means parent and child bowl.

86
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,080
It's chicken covered with eggs and sauce on rice.

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,600
- Why is that dish called an oyakodon?

88
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,060
- Well, the chicken is the parent and the egg is the child.

- [chuckles]

143
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,500
- In 1989, under a cloak of darkness

144
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,060
on the night before communism collapsed completely

145
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,340
in Czechoslovakia, ÄŒapek escaped into this country.

146
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,540
He settled right here in Frankfurt

147
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,780
and began giving lessons to children

148
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,280
as a German language teacher.

149
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,060
He was a quiet man who appeared to be thoughtful.

150
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,500
But after a while,

151
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,080
the children who had attended his classes changed.

152
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,780
One by one, the children who left his tutelage

153
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,560
began to commit suicide.

154
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,480
And others began to display extremely violent tendencies.

155
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,900
Finally, one day, there was a massive, violent eruption.

156
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,120
They were stopped, but the children were trying to kill each other.

157
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,720
While he was in custody, I questioned the boy who was the ringleader of the incident.

158
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,640
I asked him why he had done it.

159
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,200
He sat with his head down and mumbled,

160
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,560
"I want to go back to the book reading."

161
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,340
The book reading?

162
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,860
While he was there that night, that poor boy found a way to kill himself.

163
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,080
And that boy was my son.

164
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,520
Chapek disappeared from town suddenly, during the rioting caused by the extremists.

165
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,160
After a while, he finally resurfaced again.

166
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,780
We could see he was a different person.

167
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,000
He was leading an underground organization in Frankfurt,

168
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,940
and had aligned himself with right-wing extremists.

169
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,960
He then began to implement his agenda by expelling Turks and other foreigners from town.

170
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,440
Even though I've studied him, I don't really know exactly what ÄŒapek is trying to do here.

171
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,360
But I know in 1996 he was the instigator of the riots.

172
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,400
It was hell-bent on burning down the entire Turkish district, and us with it.

173
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,100
I bet you remember hearing about that incident.

174
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,400
I do. From the news.

175
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,200
The townspeople formed a community defense squad

176
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,840
as a way to fight the extremists.

177
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,660
However, in just three months' time,

178
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,300
the five leaders appointed to the community defense squad

179
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,920
all met an untimely death.

180
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,260
One by one, they all died in strange ways.

181
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,760
- And who were these five leaders that died?

182
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
- Suleiman's son,

183
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,140
Tung's father,

184
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,640
Min's husband,

185
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,460
Mustafa's son,

186
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,280
and Shemal's father.

187
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:58,500
They didn't simply die, they were murdered, all five, by Peter Chappick.

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,200
I don't know exactly why you're interested in Peter Chappick, but I will tell you this,

189
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,780
the man who's going to kill Chappick will be me.

190
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,020
"From the way this one's coming together, I think it should fly pretty well."

191
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,100
"It's hopeless."

192
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,940
"Not if we try hard."

193
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,620
"Even if we try hard, it's still not gonna fly right.

194
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,740
I know impossible's impossible.

195
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,900
Just like there's no way that we're gonna get to go on a trip to Turkey and Vietnam.

196
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,480
It's not like we have to go on a trip.

197
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,900
We like living here with Milan and everybody else, isn't that right, Tom?

198
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,400
Mm-hmm.

199
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,300
Our plane is finished. I bet it'll fly this time.

200
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,860
Here goes. See what I mean?

201
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,440
Oh!

202
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,020
Wow! Look! It's flying!

203
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,280
That's amazing!

204
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,740
It might not make it past those rooftops like Milan's do, but still, at least it's flying.

205
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,060
You mustn't ever give up.

206
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,980
What have you done with my gun?

207
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,980
My gun isn't in the drawer anymore.

208
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,780
Where is it?

209
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,280
I've got a chance to kill Peter Chapek tonight.

210
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,900
I'm going right now.

211
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,520
Give me my gun.

212
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,840
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that.

213
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,420
I can't let you use your gun to kill that man.

214
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,460
I found this pistol I'm holding inside of your coat.

215
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,320
I want to do the job with the gun that I've trained with,

216
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,680
the one I'm used to shooting.

217
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,040
Come on, just show me where you put my gun.

218
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,980
You've all created a wonderful family here.

219
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,480
You shouldn't do anything to endanger them.

220
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,460
I've been following Chapek and tracking his movements for a long time.

221
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,020
My best chance to take him out is right now.

222
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,440
Please listen, Milan. I'm asking you not to do this.

223
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,260
I've already told you. I've got to kill him.

224
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,000
Even if you take your revenge, your son can't come back to you.

225
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,180
Think of what you have now.

226
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,980
You think you have the right to say that to me?

227
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,680
Please, Milan.

228
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,400
Your path and mine are almost exactly the same, right, Dr. Tenma?

229
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,100
I looked you up and found out some things about you.

230
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,380
And if what you said is true,

231
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,440
then both of us are trying to complete the same exact mission.

232
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,780
Peter Chapek wasn't always like this.

233
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,160
I knew him way back, before he became a devil.

234
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,260
(Peter gasping)

235
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,000
Peter Chappick and I were childhood friends.

236
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,760
We both came from the same place.

237
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,960
I was the one who invited him to come to this country.

238
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,920
Milan, do you know what's on the other side of the border?

239
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,560
You're not allowed to go there.

240
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,660
I know we're not allowed, but do you know what's out there?

241
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,160
I've heard there's this wonderful place beyond the border.

242
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,200
There's a town over there that's lit up all night.

243
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,660
Is that really true, Peter?

244
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,220
And who'd you hear that from?

245
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,280
Oh, Mr. Greger told me.

246
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,920
Yeah, but he's an alcoholic.

247
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,800
Well, I've heard beyond the border,

248
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,400
there's something that ruins people and kills their spirit,

249
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,120
so they wind up just like him.

250
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,760
There's something that ruins people? Really?

251
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,100
I sure would like to see that.

252
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,220
Why would you want to see that?

253
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:58,740
Go!

254
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,420
Wow! It caught the wind!

255
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,760
You're really good, Milan!

256
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,380
It's flying so far!

257
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,600
That's amazing.

258
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,680
That plane might actually cross the border.

259
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,260
Go see what's on the other side for us, OK?

260
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,800
Peter and I were raised in a quiet town that was on the

261
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,600
Czechoslovakian-Austrian border.

262
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,300
I was the son of a laborer, and his father was a bureaucrat.

263
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,520
But strangely enough, we were good friends.

264
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,120
In 1989, the Czechoslovakian communist regime collapsed, and

265
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,060
our small world changed forever.

266
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,540
And the one who helped him escape to freedom was me, his

267
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,820
friend. The one who invited that devil into this country.

268
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,940
I have to admit, I was worried about you during the Soviet invasion last year, Peter.

269
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,760
Many people that I knew well were dragged off, but thankfully I myself am safe and sound.

270
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,180
How about you?

271
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,460
- Oh, me?

272
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,860
I guess you might say I found my calling.

273
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,400
I'm making a living with my hands now as a dentist.

274
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,420
- You always were good with your hands,

275
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,320
so now instead of making paper airplanes,

276
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,380
you're pulling teeth, huh?

277
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,880
- I'd rather be like you and have the kind of skills

278
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,380
that get you ahead in this world.

279
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,220
- Even after the Soviet invasion, I prospered.

280
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,340
Maybe it's because of those skills you envy

281
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,400
that I still enjoy my current status.

282
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,380
To be perfectly honest,

283
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,900
I was having a lot of fun during the Prague Spring.

284
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,900
- Remember how we talked about that when we were young?

285
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,500
Always wondering what the other side was like.

286
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,300
So did you get your answer?

287
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,740
- I got it.

288
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,780
- And?

289
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,960
- There was nothing special on this side or that side.

290
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,980
Sure, this country is broken,

291
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,880
but that doesn't mean that the other side is any better.

292
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,100
- I see.

293
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,140
- Earlier you said I'm good at getting ahead in the world.

294
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,040
Well, recently I found someone

295
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,840
who actually wants to use my skills.

296
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,500
- Oh yeah?

297
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,280
His way of thinking is so captivating that when you finally meet him,

298
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,040
I bet you'll stop being so concerned about falling behind in the rat race.

299
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:07,780
Hmm.

300
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,140
Once I finally came to the realization that there was nothing better about this country or that one,

301
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,320
he gave me a completely different vision of life.

302
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,600
He is the one who'll bring forth something entirely new.

303
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,040
Yeah? So what's this new thing he's gonna bring forth, Peter?

304
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,000
What does he create? Well, my friend...

305
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,560
The results could be something rather frightening.

306
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:42,000
Thinking back on it now, something inside him might have started to break down then.

307
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,280
Now give me back my gun.

308
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,940
Here, let me give you back your gun, Doctor.

309
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,000
Don't do it, Milan. Nothing good can possibly come of this.

310
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
It's no use talking. I'm going to kill him.

311
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,200
You're willing to lose everything you have right now, your family?

312
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,460
You're forgetting he killed several members from that family.

313
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,720
In a very real way, I am the one to be blamed here because I brought him to this country.

314
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,940
They were killed. Even my son.

315
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,440
When they tried to burn down this neighborhood,

316
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,060
there was one person who all the Turks around here talked about and they praised him.

317
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,420
a Japanese man who tended to the wounded with absolutely no regard for his personal safety.

318
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,660
You're that man, aren't you, Dr. Tenma?

319
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,100
I believe in you, Doctor, and I mean that.

320
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,380
And I know what you're trying to do.

321
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,440
You and I are exactly the same.

322
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,900
I'm going. It's time.

323
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,480
If I let this chance go by, I may never have another.

324
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,960
Please, Mi-Lan.

325
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,200
Thank you for trying to stop me.

326
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,100
Thank you.

327
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,740
You know, Tin-Ma,

328
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,720
if the tables were turned,

329
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,800
I doubt that I could stop you.

330
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,480
(dramatic music)

331
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,660
- Hey, gotta go! - Go!

332
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,860
(gunshots)

333
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,020
- This is so tasty!

334
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,220
- Yeah, it's different, but it's really good.

335
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,960
- Japanese Oyakodon is really delicious.

336
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:57,920
(laughing)

337
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,000
- Is your leg all right with all this standing?

338
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,200
Can I lend you a hand, Dr. Tenma?

339
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,320
- No thanks, I'm almost done preparing your bowl, Min.

340
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,640
- Milan's running late tonight,

341
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,700
but I'm sure that he'll be home very soon.

342
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,660
- Well, Oyakodon tastes much better

343
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,920
So I'll make meal on his bowl as soon as he gets back.

344
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,540
In other news, a tragedy struck at about 11 a.m. at the Rottelheim Convention Center in Frankfurt today.

345
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,680
A man with a handgun opened fire into a crowd of businessmen.

346
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,980
However, police stationed at the convention, providing security, shot and killed the gunman.

347
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,980
Thankfully, there were no other casualties as a result of this attack.

348
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,320
Due to the large number of important financial figures present, there was significant cause for concern among the attendees.

349
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,280
One man's identity and motives are still unknown.

350
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,940
We turn now to footage from the time of the incident.

351
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,940

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,980
I know that man.
