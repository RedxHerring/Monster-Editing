00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,560
Before the two of them arrived here, they only had each other.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,720
They were truly alone in this world.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,700
They were found walking hand in hand near the border of Czechoslovakia.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,040
Just the two of them, shivering all alone in the cold.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,760
I heard that the conditions in the orphanages in East Germany were pretty terrible.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,200
Not all orphanages were like 5-1-1 Kinderheim.

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,940
Inga, dear, the bathroom is the other way.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,660
Down the hall, okay?

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,560
Mommy!

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,800
It's all right. It's all right.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,920
Now you can go to the bathroom by yourself, can't you?

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,980
These poor children have never really felt the love of a parent.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,160
In order to develop as a person, the only thing you need is love.

14
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,420
The orphanages of the East Side were truly horrible places for the children to grow up in.

15
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,160
Everything was so impersonal. Even this place was only known by the number 47.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,360
We did everything we could do within our power so that we wouldn't be controlled by the government

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,080
We weren't going to be another 5-1-1 Kinderheim

18
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,540
It was a special orphanage controlled by the Ministry of Welfare and the Ministry of the Interior

19
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,840
Do you know what that means?

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,920
No, the reality was it was the Ministry of the Interior's pet project

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,740
East Germany was using that place for experimentation

22
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,840

Experimentation?

31
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,260
They were running a project that would turn the children into perfect soldiers.

32
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,320
Mental reconstruction.

33
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,100
Twisting their minds for science.

34
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,400
They made the children form factions to observe the aggression, the fighting, and the hate that resulted.

35
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,340
It was an experiment to claw every last bit of compassion out of those children and see what remained.

36
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,220
Can you imagine what kind of adults those children grew up to be?

37
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,080
And now the problem is there's no way to prove that anything like that ever went on.

38
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,760
Any type of data or secret records, all those documents were burned before the wall fell.

39
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,520
Everyone who had anything at all to do with the project fled the country.

40
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,240
However, I've heard rumors of someone who remained.

41
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,960
He managed to clean his records.

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,960
He stayed even though he was the last person in the world who deserved a second chance.

43
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,940
He was the man who was in charge of overseeing the abomination that was 511 Kinderheim.

44
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,220
And even though he was actually a pediatric psychiatrist closely affiliated with the Ministry of the Interior Police,

45
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,340
the man's real title was that of a district official with the Ministry of Welfare.

46

But you gotta hold off on soccer until your wounds heal, alright?

64

No one does.

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,220
The East German government at the time placed a strict gag order on the event.

69
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,780
It all began with the mysterious death of the director of 5-1-1 Kinderheim.

70
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,000
Soon after, there was a power struggle among the instructors there as to who would succeed him.

71
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,740
The place was thrown into anarchy. It was utter chaos.

72
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,520
They couldn't even control the children. It was every man for himself.

73
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,740
It's a miracle Johann made it out of there alive.

74
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,180

I had to know his secret.

So I asked Johan what he'd done and this was how he answered.

specifically created to transform orphans into perfect soldiers.

When you find Johan, are you going to try and kill him?

177
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,220
That will be impossible.

178
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,080
Don't look so mad.

179
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,800
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

180
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,100
But in exchange, once you hear it, you must leave immediately and never come back.

181
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,320
You should search out a General Wolf.

182
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,220
He's the one who first discovered Johann and his abilities.

183
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,980
I'm sure he's still alive somewhere.

184
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,180
So is he the man in the photograph? The one in your study?

185
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,200
Is General Wolf the man standing next to Johan?

186
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,760
He's the one who brought Johan to us. He should be able to tell you something.

187
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,200
Now, get going.

188
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,640
Dieter!

189
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,220
You can come with me or stay here, but you have to decide for yourself.

190
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,040
There's nothing to worry about!

191
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,320
If Hartmann does anything to try and stop you, I'll shoot him!

192
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,540
Dieter, listen to me.

193
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,740
The choice is your own.

194
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,960
Nobody else can make it for you.

195
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,360
Go ahead, tell the doctor.

196
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,120
There's no way you'd leave me.

197
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,260
You can't live without me, because you're my child, Dieter.

198
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,780
Now you see how it is, Dr. Tenma.

199
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,560
You can leave.

200
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,740
Where are you going?

201
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,760
It's all right.

202
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,040
It's okay.

203
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,720
That's good.

204
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,520
Nice and slow.

205
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,280
Dieter!

206
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,880
Come back here!

207
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,320
My dear little Dieter!

208
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,740
Dieter!

209
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,760
Do you really think you can live without me?

210
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,200
No, Dieter!

211
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,480
Make a move, and I'll shoot, Hartmann.

212
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,140
I love you so much, Dieter.

213
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,900
Dieter!

214
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
The world is dark.

215
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,720
The future is bleak, Dieter.

216
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,100
It's not true. Tenma told me.

217
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,640
Tomorrow will be a good day.

218
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,820
Dieter, he's wrong!

219
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,940
Be brave, Dieter.

220
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,600
(sobbing)

221
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,900
- Dieter, my boy!

222
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,720
Dieter!

223
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,500
Dieter!

224
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,620
Dieter!

225
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,000
(sobbing)

226
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,460
- Get on the bus here and take it to Kunin Street.

227
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,440
You got that?

228
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,080
The orphanage is there by the bus stop.

229
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,640
When you get there,

230
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,000
I want you to give this letter to Elna Tice.

231
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,280
She runs the orphanage.

232
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,960
I know she may look scary, but she's a nice lady.

233
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:34,580
"Be a good boy, okay? I can't stay in this town anymore, so I guess this is goodbye.

234
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,520
The bus will be along in a few minutes. Take care, Dieter. Keep up the soccer practice."

235
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,820
I'm sorry.

236
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,400
You can't come with me.

237
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,340
Here.

238
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,820
Dieter, I'm telling you, don't come with me.

239
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,720
I'm serious, okay?

240
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,540
You can't come with me, Dieter.

241
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,360

242
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,700
