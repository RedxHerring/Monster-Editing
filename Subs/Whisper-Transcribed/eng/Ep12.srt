1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
Before the two of them arrived here, they only had each other.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,720
They were truly alone in this world.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,700
They were found walking hand in hand near the border of Czechoslovakia.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,040
Just the two of them, shivering all alone in the cold.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,760
I heard that the conditions in the orphanages in East Germany were pretty terrible.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,180
Not all orphanages were like 511 Kinderheim.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,160
Inga dear the bathroom is the other way down the hall okay it's all right it's

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,720
all right there's nothing to be afraid of now you can go to the bathroom by

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,900
yourself, can't you?

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,660
These poor children

11
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,980
have never really felt the love of a parent.

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,900
In order to develop as a

13
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,780
person, the only thing you need is

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,680
love. The orphanages of the

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,860
East Side were truly horrible places

16
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,420
for the children to grow up in.

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,680
Everything was so impersonal. Even

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
this place was only known by the number

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,540
47. You'd better

20
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,660
believe we did everything we could do

21
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,700
within our power so that we wouldn't be controlled by the government we weren't

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,900
going to be another 5-1-1 kinderheim it was a special orphanage controlled by

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,180
the Ministry of Welfare and the Ministry of the Interior do you know what that

24
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,840
means no the reality was it was the Ministry of the Interior's pet project

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,840
East Germany was using that place for experimentation on the children.

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:47,820
We'll be right back.

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:57,840
♪♪

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:07,840
♪♪

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:37,820
To be continued...

30
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Mental reconstruction.

31
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Twisting their minds for science.

32
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,840
They made the children form factions to observe the aggression, the fighting and the hate that resulted.

33
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,840
It was an experiment to claw every last bit of compassion out of those children and see what remained.

34
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:09,960
remained can you imagine what kind of adults those children grew up to be and

35
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,680
now the problem is there's no way to prove that anything like that ever went

36
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,840
on any type of data or secret records all those documents were burned before

37
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,060
the wall fell everyone who had anything at all to do with the project fled the

38
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:32,260
country however I've heard rumors of someone who remained he managed to clean

39
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,360
his records he stayed even though he was the last person in the world who

40
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,120
deserved a second chance he was the man who was in charge of overseeing the

41
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,500
abomination that was 5-1-1 kinderheim and even though he was actually a

42
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,200
pediatric psychiatrist closely affiliated with the Ministry of the

43
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,120
interior police the man's real title was that of a district official with the

44
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:03,300
Ministry of Welfare a district official with the Ministry of Welfare

45
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:15,600
Inga are you all done in the bathroom sweet dreams honey all right good night

46
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,660
Good night.

47
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,120
They were careful to cover everything up.

48
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,960
Especially after that incident.

49
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,820
Incident? Tell me.

50
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,500
I need to know what exactly happened at 511 Kinderheim.

51
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,260
I've said too much already.

52
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,460
Such horrible memories.

53
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,940
But I have to know.

54
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,360
You must tell me what happened there, please.

55
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,800
where's my soccer ball huh where is it do you know where my soccer ball went to oh

56
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,240
here you go i have it right here

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,960
but you gotta hold off on soccer until your wounds heal all right that man who brought

58
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,240
you in earlier said he was going to pick you up soon you just get some rest until then okay

59
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,540
I don't know what really happened there. No one does.

60
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,240
The East German government at the time placed a strict gag order on the event.

61
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,780
It all began with the mysterious death of the director of 511 Kinderheim.

62
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,000
Soon after, there was a power struggle among the instructors there as to who would succeed him.

63
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,740
The place was thrown into anarchy. It was utter chaos.

64
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,440
They couldn't even control the children. It was every man for himself.

65
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,740
It's a miracle Johan made it out of there alive.

66
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,180
Then what? What exactly happened at 511 Kinderheim?

67
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,120
Everybody there died.

68
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,860
What?

69
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,320
All of the instructors and every last orphan except Johan.

70
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,100
Those people massacred each other.

71
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,060
The world's not a dark place, that's a lie

72
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,120
Tomorrow will be a good day, I promise

73
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,100
Dieter, time to gather up your things, honey

74
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:52,400
Excuse me, Mr. Hartman, but aren't we going to go home now?

75
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,540
No, we're taking a little detour.

76
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,560
But I don't want to go back there.

77
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,920
No, no, I don't want to go!

78
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,780
Dieter? Dieter, come on now. Be a good boy.

79
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,080
What do you mean?

80
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,560
I told you not to let Dieter leave with anyone until I came back, didn't I?

81
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,800
But all I did was...

82
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,540
That person was the child's foster father.

83
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,400
And let me tell you, he was very much a gentleman.

84
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,400
Unlike you, obviously.

85
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,340
Look, I'm sorry, but that man...

86
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,680
I wouldn't worry.

87
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,500
That boy seemed very happy to be going with him.

88
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,620
Dana!

89
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:16,700
Dieter, I'm here!

90
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,140
Dieter?

91
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,020
They're not back yet.

92
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,540
Hartmann's library.

93
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:24,380
These photos were taken at different times, but they were all shot at the same location.

94
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,480
So what am I looking at?

95
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:37,500
Johan

96
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,660
Who's the man in the photo next to him?

97
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,660
Yes, that's it

98
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,300
Every single one of these photographs was taken at 511 Kinderheim

99
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,400
And it looks like they were taken over ten years ago

100
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,300
All of the instructors and every last orphan except Johan

101
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,580
Those people massacred each other

102
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,120
Dieter

103
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,180
Could he be another?

104
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:55,280
To be continued...

105
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:25,280
I don't know.

106
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:39,660
Dieter!

107
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,700
Just hold on, Dieter! I'm coming!

108
00:12:45,700 --> 00:13:02,140
this child is blind to what i show him hartman he can't see it he can't even comprehend what

109
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:15,180
johan saw he's not like him it's no good it has failed again this boy is no johan

110
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:26,400
Every single one of them died here. Did you know that?

111
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:38,840
Ten years ago, the instructors and the orphans, all 50 people died.

112
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:44,560
Johan sat here

113
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
Just watching it all happen

114
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,740
He just sat here

115
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,580
And watched everything

116
00:13:51,580 --> 00:14:03,160
He didn't lift a finger

117
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,420
He just watched

118
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:22,140
I had to know his secret so I asked Johan what he'd done and this was how he

119
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:28,280
answered he dropped a piece of oil-soaked cloth into the fire like

120
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,700
this

121
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:46,920
do you get it do you know what he meant by that i simply added a bit of fuel to the hatred born

122
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:56,240
when people come together it was easy that's what he told me only 10 years old and he said that

123
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,400
and he did it with almost no effort at all he was able to make 50 people kill each other

124
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Without even moving a finger

125
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
It was you

126
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,380
It was you and your damned experiments that twisted Johan into what he is

127
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
So you think it was us

128
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,620
I'm sorry. It wasn't us at all

129
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
We didn't make him that way

130
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,280
It's true that 511 Kinderheim was an experimental project

131
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,880
specifically created to transform orphans into perfect soldiers

132
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,660
Thinking back on it now, it really was only a little experiment.

133
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,500
As for Johan, he's no soldier. Not at all.

134
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,620
He was better. He was a natural-born leader of men.

135
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,120
Someone who was meant to stand at the very top of the world.

136
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,980
There's no way we could have ever created such a work of art.

137
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,900
He was beyond human from the beginning. A veritable monster.

138
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Johan made a prediction.

139
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,880
He predicted that mankind would end up hating itself into oblivion.

140
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,880
And what do you think Johan's goal was?

141
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Do you want to know what he told me?

142
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,880
He said he wanted to be the last person left in this world.

143
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
He did.

144
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,880
My poor Dieter. The future is dark.

145
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,880
You must try harder to become more like Johann.

146
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
It's a pity.

147
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Why are you such a failure?

148
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Why can't you be more like Johann? Tell me why!

149
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,740
Drop the gun or I'll shoot! Don't you lay a finger on him, Hartmann!

150
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:12,080
Get out of here. This is our problem. It's none of your business. Just leave!

151
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,500
Dieter! Come down from there!

152
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,720
Sorry, Dr. Tenma.

153
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,840
That's right. You were wanting to know more about Johan.

154
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,220
What were you planning to do once you knew more?

155
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,220
When you find Johan, are you going to try and kill him?

156
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
That will be impossible.

157
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,220
Don't look so mad.

158
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,220
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

159
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,220
But in exchange, once you hear it, you must leave immediately and never come back.

160
00:17:45,220 --> 00:18:02,240
you should search out a general wolf he's the one who first discovered johan and his abilities

161
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,220
i'm sure he's still alive somewhere so is he the man in the photograph the one in your study

162
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,220
He's General Volf, the man standing next to Johan.

163
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,520
He's the one who brought Johan to us.

164
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,780
He should be able to tell you something.

165
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,200
Now, get going.

166
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,640
Dieter!

167
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,200
You can come with me or stay here, but you have to decide for yourself.

168
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,940
There's nothing to worry about.

169
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,300
If Hartmann does anything to try and stop you, I'll shoot him.

170
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,540
Deeter, listen to me.

171
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,720
The choice is your own.

172
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,980
Nobody else can make it for you.

173
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,360
Go ahead, tell the doctor.

174
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,120
There's no way you'd leave me.

175
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,040
Now would you?

176
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,800
You can't live without me.

177
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,140
Because you're my child, Deeter.

178
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:09,780
Now you see how it is, Dr. Tenma

179
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,560
You can leave

180
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:46,540
where are you going it's all right it's okay that's good nice and slow

181
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:56,800
Dieter come back here my dear little Dieter Dieter do you really think you can live without me

182
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,200
No, Dieter!

183
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,480
Make a move and I'll shoot, Hartmann!

184
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
I love you so much, Dieter!

185
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,860
Dieter!

186
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,120
The world is dark!

187
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,680
The future is bleak, Dieter!

188
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,100
It's not true, Tenmet told me.

189
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,640
Tomorrow will be a good day.

190
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,820
Dieter, he's wrong!

191
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:28,320
Be brave, Dieter. Don't be afraid.

192
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,020
Dieter, fly, fly, Dieter!

193
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,020
Dieter!

194
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,020
Dieter!

195
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,020
Dieter!

196
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
Dieter!

197
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
Get on the bus here and take it to Kunin Street.

198
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
You got that?

199
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,020
The orphanage is there by the bus stop.

200
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,000
When you get there, I want you to give this letter to Elna Tice.

201
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,280
She runs the orphanage.

202
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,980
I know she may look scary, but she's a nice lady.

203
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,140
Be a good boy, okay?

204
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,880
I can't stay in this town anymore.

205
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,360
So I guess this is goodbye.

206
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,800
The bus will be along in a few minutes.

207
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,340
Take care, Dieter.

208
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,340
Keep up the soccer practice.

209
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:58,320
I'm sorry. You can't come with me. Here.

210
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,700
Dieter, I'm telling you, don't come with me. I'm serious, okay?

211
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:17,540
You can't come with me, Dieter.
