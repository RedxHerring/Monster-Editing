I heard that the conditions in the orphanages in East Germany were pretty terrible.

The orphanages of the East Side were truly horrible places for the children to grow up in.

176
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,960
When you find Johan, are you going to try and kill him?

177
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,220
That will be impossible.

178
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,080
Don't look so mad.

179
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,800
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

180
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,100
But in exchange, once you hear it, you must leave immediately and never come back.

181
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,320
You should search out a General Wolf.

182
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,220
He's the one who first discovered Johann and his abilities.

183
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,980
I'm sure he's still alive somewhere.

184
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,180
So is he the man in the photograph? The one in your study?

185
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,200
Is General Wolf the man standing next to Johan?

186
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,760
He's the one who brought Johan to us. He should be able to tell you something.

187
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,200
Now, get going.

188
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,640
Dieter!

189
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,220
You can come with me or stay here, but you have to decide for yourself.

190
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,040
There's nothing to worry about!

191
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,320
If Hartmann does anything to try and stop you, I'll shoot him!

192
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,540
Dieter, listen to me.

193
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,740
The choice is your own.

194
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,960
Nobody else can make it for you.

195
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,360
Go ahead, tell the doctor.

196
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,120
There's no way you'd leave me.

197
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,260
You can't live without me, because you're my child, Dieter.

198
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,780
Now you see how it is, Dr. Tenma.

199
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,560
You can leave.

200
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,740
Where are you going?

201
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,760
It's all right.

202
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,040
It's okay.

203
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,720
That's good.

204
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,520
Nice and slow.

205
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,280
Dieter!

206
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,880
Come back here!

207
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,320
My dear little Dieter!

208
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,740
Dieter!

209
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,760
Do you really think you can live without me?

210
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,200
No, Dieter!

211
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,480
Make a move, and I'll shoot, Hartmann.

212
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,140
I love you so much, Dieter.

213
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,900
Dieter!

214
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
The world is dark.

215
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,720
The future is bleak, Dieter.

216
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,100
It's not true. Tenma told me.

217
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,640
Tomorrow will be a good day.

218
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,820
Dieter, he's wrong!

219
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,940
Be brave, Dieter.

220
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,600
(sobbing)

221
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,900
- Dieter, my boy!

222
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,720
Dieter!

223
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,500
Dieter!

224
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,620
Dieter!

225
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,000
(sobbing)

226
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,460
- Get on the bus here and take it to Kunin Street.

227
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,440
You got that?

228
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,080
The orphanage is there by the bus stop.

229
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,640
When you get there,

230
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,000
I want you to give this letter to Elna Tice.

231
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,280
She runs the orphanage.

232
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,960
I know she may look scary, but she's a nice lady.

233
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:34,580
"Be a good boy, okay? I can't stay in this town anymore, so I guess this is goodbye.

234
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,520
The bus will be along in a few minutes. Take care, Dieter. Keep up the soccer practice."

235
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,820
I'm sorry.

236
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,400
You can't come with me.

237
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,340
Here.

238
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,820
Dieter, I'm telling you, don't come with me.

239
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,720
I'm serious, okay?

240
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,540
You can't come with me, Dieter.

241
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,360
[MUSIC]

242
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,700
