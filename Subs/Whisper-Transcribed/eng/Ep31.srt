1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Go on, young man, eat. This place is known for its tasty vice-versed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Mmm, mmm, isn't it wonderful? Your name's Dieter, right?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Doctor, you better eat now or there might not be anything left when Dieter's done.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There's no need to worry, Dr. Tenma.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This place is safe. Only local folks come here.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And if a strange face tries to get in, our friend Otto here will show them the door.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,760
Show them the door.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,440
Hmm.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,880
You know, business has really dropped off since I've been doing that.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,100
Now, who just ordered the Spetzla?

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,920
Oh, that would be me.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,120
I pulled together a bed in the attic.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,300
If you can ignore the rats, you should sleep pretty good up there.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,820
Thanks, I owe you one.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,440
He's quite a kidder, but a decent guy.

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,340
E, you can't do much on an empty stomach.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,580
Thank you for getting me a safe place to sleep.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,320
I should be the one who's thanking you.

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,400
By now I'd be dead in the morgue

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,680
if you hadn't come along and rescued me like you did.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,240
Feeding death makes this meal taste even better.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,640
Go on, dig in.

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,460
I already spoke to Dr. Gillen.

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,240
He was very pleased and relieved to hear that we found you.

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,520
He left an ad in the local newspaper trying to contact you.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,840
Did you see it by any chance?

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,300
Let's talk about our memories of cheating.

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,240
So you did see it?

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,320
I did.

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,220
Well, then why didn't you try to contact him?

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,340
Because I didn't want anyone else getting involved.

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,580
But that's what friends are for, especially during times like these.

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,540
So, earlier you said you were watching over me.

34
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,120
That's because of the Richard Brown incident.

35
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,700
Please explain.

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,300
You probably know best what happened to him.

37
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,420
Brown was drunk when he shot down that young serial killer.

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,460
That night cost him his career and his family.

39
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,560
As I read about the boy Richard had killed, Dieter recognized the photograph.

40
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,520
Dieter said that boy was in 511 Kinderheim.

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,420
And what's 511 Kinderheim?

42
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,940
It's an orphanage that was in East Germany.

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
A very special one.

44
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,020
Dieter's foster father was one of the instructors,

45
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,920
and he kept pictures of the children that lived there.

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,880
And this orphanage figures into things.

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,920
Johan used to call it home.

48
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,280
Huh. So you're saying there's a connection between Johan and the serial killer that Richard shot?

49
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,780
I'm not sure.

50
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,060
Brown died before I could get any details from him to tie this all together.

51
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,600
But he led me to you.

52
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,540
I saw you at his grave.

53
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,360
I thought you might be able to fill in some of the blanks.

54
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,760
So that's it.

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,200
Oh, Richard.

56
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Even in death, you're still helping us get to the bottom of this.

57
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,440
I know that until now you've been all alone out there.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,300
But now, we're gonna solve this together.

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,640
We must strive to prove that you're innocent.

60
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,100
I think I know where we can find Johan.

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,020
Wait till you get a load of this.

62
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,820
I thought I had it on me.

63
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,140
Damn, I had a photo of Johan before.

64
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,940
Of all the stupid...

65
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,220
I must have left it in the office when I was attacked.

66
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,800
If you left that picture there, that man trying to kill you probably found it.

67
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,380
If that's the case, it's good as gone.

68
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,020
That man said he'd been sent to me for counseling by his wife.

69
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,160
Her last name was Hess, but there was nobody I could find with that last name.

70
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,680
He was a hitman, and he certainly tried to live up to that title.

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,740
Hmm. Johan is here, and so am I.

72
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,740
There must be a way to actually meet him, right?

73
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,300
Mm-hmm. I will meet Johan, face to face.

74
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:44,720
We'll be right back.

75
00:04:44,740 --> 00:05:14,720
We'll see you next time.

76
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:24,320
Welcome to Talbach and Schuwald AG.

77
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,140
This is their headquarters, the epicenter of the Schuwald Financial Group.

78
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,840
A year ago, Mr. Schuwald was rarely here, but lately he's been around a lot.

79
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,580
Every morning, Mr. Schuwald leaves here to tour his affiliated offices.

80
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,580
Richard discovered this pattern when he was still alive.

81
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,940
This firm has grown exponentially as of late.

82
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,220
His entire financial group has seen huge growth and profits, and the reason for all this is

83
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,700
quite clear.

84
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,260
The turnaround began when a certain youth became Schuwald's right-hand man.

85
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:03,640
And here they come now.

86
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,040
Schuwald's the older man in the wheelchair.

87
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,320
Karl's the young man pushing him.

88
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Now look closely.

89
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,320
Tell me, is the blonde one Johann?

90
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
That was him, there's no doubt.

91
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Good.

92
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
This was the first time.

93
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Huh?

94
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
I've only seen him at night.

95
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,320
I've never seen Johann in the daytime before.

96
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Well, I'd say it's right about time we shed a little light on the matter.

97
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
This is my only chance.

98
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,320
That's true. We might not have another chance to prove your innocence.

99
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
But we must be judicious here.

100
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,320
You'd better keep lying low in Otto's attic for now.

101
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,660
To prove you're innocent, we must be thorough and methodical.

102
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,060
I should have another look at Richard's file.

103
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,840
Ah, here it is.

104
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,600
Good thing I decided to bring this one home.

105
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,600
Yes, my friend.

106
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,820
It'll be just a little longer, Richard.

107
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,060
I promise you, we will avenge your death soon.

108
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,620
We have discovered Johan, and we've got Dr. Tenma, the key witness.

109
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,980
There's just one thing left to do. One thing.

110
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,900
All that's left is to find someone who saw Richard the night he died.

111
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,760
There's got to be someone.

112
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,000
Once we find that person, we'll be able to prove that Johan was with Richard the night that he was killed.

113
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,220
Even if that doesn't work out, there's that young man Farin who claimed he was Shuvald's son and then committed suicide.

114
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,960
If we can find that prostitute far and visited,

115
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,480
we'll be able to prove that Johan was there with him.

116
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,240
We've got to find someone who can put Johan at the scene of the crime.

117
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,980
There's even a third way to make our case.

118
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,840
We can question the couple who claim they're Johan's parents,

119
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,860
and then we'll be able to find out who this imposter really is.

120
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,260
Keep in mind that we've discovered the real Johan Liebert's burial plot.

121
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,200
We're slowly tightening the noose around this Johan character's neck.

122
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,360
Mm-hmm.

123
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,620
You know, Tenma, looking at your sad eyes,

124
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,320
I find myself feeling the way I did when I looked at Richard.

125
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,500
You look like, well, it's as if you're trying to take on the troubles of the whole planet.

126
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,340
But don't despair, Tenma. You're not alone.

127
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,560
There's Dieter, and now you've got Dr. Gillen, and I'm here as well.

128
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,580
Things are going to be all right from now on.

129
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,500
Now go get yourself some sleep.

130
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,220
Because... I didn't want anyone else getting involved.

131
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,220
This was the first time.

132
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,220
I've only seen him at night.

133
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,220
I've never seen Johan in the daytime before.

134
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
This is my only chance.

135
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,220
Wait! Why aren't you...

136
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,220
Get out of here, now!

137
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Now run!

138
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:43,100
This is Reichwein speaking.

139
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,220
Doctor, it's me, Gillen.

140
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,360
Ah, what a coincidence. I was about to call you to discuss what our next move should be.

141
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,420
I'll stop by later today.

142
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,120
By the way, where's Tenma?

143
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,360
Tenma? Why, he's at the safe house or so I believe.

144
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,320
Wherever he is, I need you to make sure that he stays put.

145
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,180
there's an issue that's been bothering me I feel it too it's dr. ten was

146
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,460
mindset he doesn't appear to want to go after Johan in spite of the fact that

147
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,900
doing so could prove his innocence I don't want to believe it but that's

148
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,320
exactly what I'm worried about

149
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:48,360
Dieter what are you doing here he told me he sent me over here then where's

150
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:57,000
Tenma he's gone off to where to take care of it what ten was planning to fix

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:11,060
it himself. Stop him, Doctor. Please, you gotta stop him. Don't let him do it. Tenma's going to become a killer.

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:40,260
That's enough for today. We're done.

153
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,220
Don't say that now. I'm just getting warmed up.

154
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,980
Doc, this is where it gets real interesting.

155
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,320
Not today. We'll pick it up from here next time. How about that?

156
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,940
I tell you, the third one I killed? Now that's a great story to hear.

157
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:04,060
she was only 18 come on doc hear me out the way i lured her into my house was great she had no clue

158
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,420
you gotta hear how she screamed when i strangled her listen to me doc come on

159
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:18,860
where's timba runoff to think rudy

160
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,660
Greetings, Dr. Gillen

161
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,400
At last we meet

162
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,340
And who are you?

163
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,720
My name is Inspector Lungay

164
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,940
I'm with the BKA

165
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,220
Actually, I'm well acquainted with your work, Detective

166
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,880
You've been responsible for the apprehension of many of the serial killers that I've interviewed

167
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,440
Since I read your book, one could say that I know of you as well

168
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,520
Why, thank you

169
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:54,320
What a remarkable piece of work. Transcendental Criminal Psychology.

170
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,100
What makes it a great book is that you possess deep insight into what goes on in the mind of

171
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,180
a serial killer. I especially liked your explanation of what motivated Heinz Kahl's

172
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:12,140
behavior in Chapter 3 of your book, on pages 262 to 294. I tend to agree with your supposition

173
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,060
that the trauma he experienced during his childhood turned him into a sociopath and

174
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,960
then a criminal. Well, then we think the same way. I feel honored that you've read my book

175
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,100
so thoroughly. My investigative methods also require me to get into the minds of these

176
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,140
criminals. I try to predict what their actions will be by acting out what it is I think they'll

177
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,340
do next. It sounds like you have a lot of experience. We should discuss your techniques

178
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,420
when we have more time. I would have to agree that neither of us have much time. I need

179
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:49,280
to ask you something now. Lately, you've been driving a lot to Munich, isn't that correct?

180
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,860
That's right, what of it? Please, doctor, have a seat for a minute. This won't take very long.

181
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:05,480
You've seen a psychologist named Reichwein three times this week. Why so often? Simple. He was one

182
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:12,620
of my professors from university. Dusseldorf University. Correct. There was someone special

183
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,980
in your class this one fellow student of yours who went on to become a brilliant neurosurgeon

184
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:27,100
where are you going with all this have you met up with dr tenma no what are you talking about

185
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,060
allow me to refresh your memory let's talk about our memories of cheating

186
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,340
rudy you placed that classified ad in every leading newspaper in the country from may 1st

187
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:44,620
to the 22nd. Imagine my surprise. Shocking. I never thought brilliant people like you or Dr.

188
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,220
Tenma ever had to cheat. Even as students, it seems out of character for the two of you.

189
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,640
It's interesting what best friends will do. Inspector, I wouldn't say that Dr. Tenma and

190
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,160
I were even friends when we attended Dusseldorf. Last May in Oder Park, with your help, the Velber

191
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,520
police were able to surround Dr. Tenma. They were poised to take him into custody, but at the last

192
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,260
In a second, he miraculously escaped.

193
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,160
Well, then you must also know that the wire I was wearing malfunctioned.

194
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,760
It's still possible that you might have helped him to escape.

195
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,360
Come on, I know that Tenma is innocent.

196
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,080
Really?

197
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,580
Have an open mind and listen to me.

198
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,780
The director of Eisler Memorial Hospital

199
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,620
and three other people that were murdered in Dusseldorf,

200
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,820
the murder of a patient in a building under construction,

201
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,640
the murder in Heidelberg. The middle-aged couples that were murdered across the country.

202
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,540
Those were the works of a madman, not Tenma. I reached this conclusion from interviewing

203
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,900
Dr. Tenma in person, as a criminal psychologist.

204
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,520
Interesting. So, where is he now?

205
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,660
Who knows? He's run off somewhere again.

206
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,320
Why did he run away? Why would he run away if he were innocent?

207
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,640
He is innocent!

208
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,200
You think so? He needs friends like you to help him, so why would he leave you in the dark?

209
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,060
Well, I have proof that he isn't the murderer you think he is.

210
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,640
Have a look at this, Inspector.

211
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,120
I personally compiled this analysis of all the evidence in this case.

212
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:51,020
You're very thorough.

213
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,500
So tell me, do you understand my conclusion?

214
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,280
Yes.

215
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,660
A strange death of Farin, the boy who pretended to be Schuwalt's son.

216
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,780
The seemingly accidental death of ex-police detective Richard Brown, who was investigating this case.

217
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,560
The questions and rumors surrounding Schuwalt's illegitimate child.

218
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,320
There's a young man who's at the center of this entire case.

219
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,100
When Tenma was questioned by police, he named this young man as the real murderer.

220
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,620
Johann Liebert.

221
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:31,380
While he was still alive, Richard Brown discovered a gravestone of a person with that same first and last name in Bruntal.

222
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,960
Furthermore, someone who admitted to being a hitman tried to kill Dr. Reichwein after he picked up the investigation from where Brown had left off.

223
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,260
Oh, I understand quite well.

224
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,300
But you're wrong. It's impossible to actually prove that all these separate events are connected.

225
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,620
Tenma has gone into hiding because he understands this more than anyone does.

226
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,620
Am I wrong?

227
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,620
I keep noticing that you tap your fingers.

228
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:20,620
Oh. That's just a little habit I have. It helps me to remember important points in a case.

229
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:26,480
As a psychologist, it appears to me that your own anxiety is manifesting itself in the way you constantly do it.

230
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,100
I do the same thing. I use my recorder instead of my hand.

231
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,400
However, the sounds that are recorded on this device are absolutely objective.

232
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:43,860
But in your case, the information that you remember when you're drumming your fingers has already been tainted by your own preset opinions.

233
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,360
That's probably how you've always done your job, Inspector. For all these years. Right up until now.

234
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,620
You believe that your memory is correct, and that your judgement couldn't possibly be wrong.

235
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,620
Do you have a wife or a family? Any hobbies outside your work?

236
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,620
You live for your job, don't you? Ever made a mistake?

237
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,620
Inside, aren't you terribly afraid to make a mistake?

238
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,620
The way you think, everything's black or white, so Tenma has to be a bad person.

239
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,620
And if your judgement turned out to be wrong, your whole world would fall apart.

240
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,120
You need to look at the truth.

241
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,620
This is a recent photograph of Johann Lehmert.

242
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,120
Can you prove all the deaths surrounding Johann is just coincidence?

243
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,620
This young man, where would I find him this very moment?

244
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,120
He's a student at the University of Munich.

245
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,000
At the moment, he's Schuwalt's private secretary.

246
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,740
So this is him.

247
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,340
I'll need to hold on to this photograph, Doctor.

248
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,100
From this point on, let's consider this a police matter.

249
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,080
You know, perhaps I made a terrible mistake.

250
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,920
Where is Dr. Tenma right now?

251
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,740
He should still be in Munich.

252
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:39,040
Yes, this is Lungay. Put me through to the Munich police. I need an emergency deployment.

253
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,880
Dr. Tenma is somewhere in the city of Munich.

254
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:53,140
A sniper rifle?

255
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,280
Look, I don't got a clue what you're talking about.

256
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,080
Wait, so Mr. Heitmeier didn't call you from his mountain villa in Fusen?

257
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,560
10,000 Deutschmarks in advance.

258
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,060
Here.

259
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:16,700
Your order is a little complicated for me to fill

260
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,800
It'll take about a week to get it

261
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,060
In the meantime, go get some sun

262
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,820
You look pale

263
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,100
Listen, you're getting yourself a good piece

264
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,160
But it's a waste if you don't know how to use it

265
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,580
Just remember that

266
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:35,060
Next in the news

267
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,580
City officials attended a posh reception

268
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,080
for the Munich Electronics Industry Trade Show

269
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,580
that's being hosted this weekend

270
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,360
by the state's Chamber of Commerce

271
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,600
in association with local business leaders.

272
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,620
Political and business figures

273
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,480
from all over the world are attending.

274
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,800
With the formation of the EU,

275
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,940
Bavaria's industries are poised

276
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,220
to become the center of Europe's media network.

277
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,160
This is the largest trade show

278
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,360
Munich has ever hosted,

279
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,780
and the monetary impact on the local economy

280
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,500
from this event is in the millions.

281
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,360
In a related story,

282
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,320
noted industrialist Hans Georg Schuvold,

283
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,760
who hasn't appeared in public for nearly 20 years,

284
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,320
was seen at the reception

285
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,960
and received rousing applause from the attendees.

286
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,580
Mr. Schuvold was in a wheelchair, but he appeared healthy.
