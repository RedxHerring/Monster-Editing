1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,260
Go on, young man, eat. This place is known for its tasty weisswurst.

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,500
Mm-mm, isn't it wonderful? Your name's Dieter, right?

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,800
Doctor, you better eat now, or there might not be anything left when Dieter's done.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,200
There's no need to worry, Dr. Tenma.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,720
This place is safe. Only local folks come here.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,740
And if a strange face tries to get in, our friend Otto here will show them the door.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,600
Hmm, you know business has really dropped off since I've been doing that now who just ordered the Spetzler. Oh, that would be me. I

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,580
Pulled together a bed in the attic if you can ignore the rats. You should sleep pretty good up there

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,880
Thanks. I owe you one

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,480
He's quite a kidder but a decent guy

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,800
He you can't do much on an empty stomach. Thank you for getting me a safe place to sleep. I

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,700
you. By now I'd be dead in the morgue if you hadn't come along and rescued me like you did.

13
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,640
Feeding death makes this meal taste even better. Go on, dig in.

14
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,240
I already spoke to Dr. Gillen. He was very pleased and relieved to hear that we found you.

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,840
He left an ad in the local newspaper trying to contact you. Did you see it by any chance?

16
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,320
Let's talk about our memories of cheating.

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,260
So you did see it?

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,240
- Well, then why didn't you try to contact him?

19
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,320
- Because I didn't want anyone else getting involved.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,200
- But that's what friends are for,

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,580
especially during times like these.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,540
So, earlier you said you were watching over me.

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,080
- That's because of the Richard Brown incident.

24
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,700
- Please explain.

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,280
- You probably know best what happened to him.

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,420
Brown was drunk when he shot down that young serial killer.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,460
his career and his family.

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,040
As I read about the boy Richard had killed,

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,560
Dieter recognized the photograph.

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,500
Dieter said that boy was in 511 Kinderheim.

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,400
And what's 511 Kinderheim?

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,940
It's an orphanage that was in East Germany,

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,860
a very special one.

34
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,000
Dieter's foster father was one of the instructors,

35
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,960
and he kept pictures of the children that lived there.

36
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,880
And this orphanage figures into things.

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,940
Johann used to call it home.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,300
So you're saying there's a connection between Johan and the serial killer that Richard shot?

39
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,780
I'm not sure.

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,060
Brown died before I could get any details from him to tie this all together.

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,600
But he led me to you.

42
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,540
I saw you at his grave.

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,340
I thought you might be able to fill in some of the blanks.

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,780
So that's it.

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,220
Oh, Richard.

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,100
Even in death, you're still helping us get to the bottom of this.

47
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,420
I know that until now you've been all alone out there.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,300
But now, we're gonna solve this together.

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,640
We must strive to prove that you're innocent.

50
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,100
I think I know where we can find Johan.

51
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,020
Wait 'til you get a load of this.

52
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,820
I thought I had it on me.

53
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,140
Damn, I had a photo of Johan before.

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,240
Of all the stupid, I must have left it in the office

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,220
when I was attacked.

56
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,120
- If you left that picture there,

57
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,800
that man trying to kill you probably found it.

58
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,380
- If that's the case, it's good as gone.

59
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,580
That man said he'd been sent to me

60
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,020
for counseling by his wife.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,180
Hess, but there was nobody I could find with that last name. He was a hitman, and he certainly

62
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,680
tried to live up to that title.

63
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:44,760
Hmm. Johan is here, and so am I. There must be a way to actually meet him, right?

64
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,280
Mm-hmm. I will meet Johan face-to-face.

65
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,900
[MUSIC]

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,900
(upbeat music)

67
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,300
Welcome to Talbach and Schuwald AG.

68
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,760
This is their headquarters, the epicenter of the Schuwald Financial Group.

69
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,980
A year ago, Mr. Schuwald was rarely here, but lately he's been around a lot.

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,980
Every morning, Mr. Schuwald leaves here to tour his affiliated offices.

71
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,880
Richard discovered this pattern when he was still alive.

72
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,780
This firm has grown exponentially as of late.

73
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,920
His entire financial group has seen huge growth and profits,

74
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,000
and the reason for all this is quite clear.

75
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,820
The turnaround began when a certain youth

76
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,900
became Schuwald's right-hand man.

77
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,280
And here they come now.

78
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,000
Schuwald's the older man in the wheelchair.

79
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,300
Karl's the young man pushing him.

80
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,400
Now look closely.

81
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,900
(dramatic music)

82
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,000
- Tell me, is the blonde one Johan?

83
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,980
- That was him, there's no doubt.

84
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,560
- Good.

85
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:49,560
This was the first time. I've only seen him at night. I've never seen Johan in the daytime before.

86
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,880
Well, I'd say it's right about time we shed a little light on the matter.

87
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,160
This is my only chance.

88
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,900
That's true. We might not have another chance to prove your innocence.

89
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,880
But we must be judicious here. You'd better keep lying low in Otto's attic for now.

90
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,640
To prove you're innocent, we must be thorough and methodical.

91
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,080
I should have another look at Richard's file.

92
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,820
Ah, here it is.

93
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,580
Good thing I decided to bring this one home.

94
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,620
Yes, my friend.

95
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,820
It'll be just a little longer, Richard.

96
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,040
I promise you, we will avenge your death soon.

97
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,920
We have discovered Johan,

98
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,640
and we've got Dr. Tenma, the key witness.

99
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:48,200
left to do. One thing. All that's left is to find someone who saw Richard the night

100
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,740
he died. There's got to be someone. Once we find that person, we'll be able to prove that

101
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,300
Johan was with Richard the night that he was killed. Even if that doesn't work out, there's

102
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,220
that young man, Farin, who claimed he was Shuvald's son and then committed suicide.

103
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,020
If we can find that prostitute Farin visited, we'll be able to prove that Johan was there

104
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,260
with him. We've got to find someone who can put Johan at the scene of the crime.

105
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,980
There's even a third way to make our case. We can question the couple who claim they're

106
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,860
Johan's parents and then we'll be able to find out who this imposter really is.

107
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,260
Keep in mind that we've discovered the real Johan Liebert's burial plot.

108
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,200
We're slowly tightening the noose around this Johan character's neck.

109
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,760
You know Tenma, looking at your sad eyes, I find myself feeling the way I did when I

110
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,320
looked at Richard.

111
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,500
You look like, well, it's as if you're trying to take on the troubles of the whole planet.

112
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,340
But don't despair, Tenma.

113
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,340
You're not alone.

114
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,580
There's Dieter, and now you've got Dr. Gillen, and I'm here as well.

115
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,580
Things are going to be all right from now on.

116
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,520
Now, go get yourself some sleep.

117
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,720
Because I didn't want anyone else getting involved.

118
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,860
This was the first time.

119
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,580
I've only seen him at night.

120
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,500
I've never seen Johan in the daytime before.

121
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,060
This is my only chance.

122
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,000
Wait! Why aren't you... Get out of here, now!

123
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,580
Now run!

124
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,120
This is Reikwein speaking.

125
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,220
Doctor, it's me, Gellan.

126
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,020
Ah, what a coincidence.

127
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,700
I was about to call you to discuss what our next move should be.

128
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,460
I'll stop by later today.

129
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,120
By the way, where's Tenma?

130
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,360
Tenma? Why, he's at the safehouse or so I believe.

131
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,320
Wherever he is, I need you to make sure that he stays put.

132
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,700
There's an issue that's been bothering me.

133
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,140
I feel it too.

134
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,660
Huh?

135
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,800
It's Dr. Tenma's mindset.

136
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,300
He doesn't appear to want to go after Johan,

137
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,180
in spite of the fact that doing so could prove his innocence.

138
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,080
I don't want to believe it,

139
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,460
(upbeat music)

140
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,280
(dramatic music)

141
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,900
- Dieter.

142
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,740
What are you doing here?

143
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,960
- He told me.

144
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,900
He sent me over here.

145
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,960
- Then, where's Tenma?

146
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,420
- He's gone off.

147
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,380
- To where?

148
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,340
- To take care of it.

149
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,800
Denma's planning to fix it himself.

150
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,040
Stop him, Doctor.

151
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
Please, you gotta stop him.

152
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,940
Don't let him do it.

153
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,060
Denma's going to become a killer.

154
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,260
That's enough for today. We're done.

155
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,980
Don't say that now. I'm just getting warmed up. Doc, this is where it gets real interesting.

156
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,320
Not today. We'll pick it up from here next time. How about that?

157
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,640
I tell you, the third one I killed? Now that's a great story to hear. She was only 18.

158
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,920
Aw, come on, Doc! Hear me out! The way I lured her into my house was great! She had no clue!

159
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,360
You gotta hear how she screamed when I strangled her! Listen to me, Doc! Come on!

160
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,820
Where's Timma run off to? Dink Rudy.

161
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,380
Greetings, Dr. Killen. At last we meet.

162
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,300
And who are you?

163
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,920
My name is Inspector Lungay. I'm with the BKA.

164
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,220
Actually, I'm well acquainted with your work, Detective.

165
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,860
You've been responsible for the apprehension of many of the serial killers that I've interviewed.

166
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,360
Since I read your book, one could say that I know of you as well.

167
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,460
Why, thank you.

168
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,740
piece of work. Transcendental Criminal Psychology. What makes it a great book is

169
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,040
that you possess deep insight into what goes on in the mind of a serial killer.

170
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,900
I especially liked your explanation of what motivated Heinz Kahl's behavior in

171
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,620
chapter 3 of your book on pages 262 to 294. I tend to agree with your

172
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,360
supposition that the trauma he experienced during his childhood turned

173
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,740
him into a sociopath and then a criminal.

174
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Well then we think the same way.

175
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,680
I feel honored that you've read my book so thoroughly.

176
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,520
My investigative methods also require me to get into the minds of these criminals.

177
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,360
I try to predict what their actions will be by acting out what it is I think they'll do

178
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,820
next.

179
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,420
It sounds like you have a lot of experience.

180
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,620
We should discuss your techniques when we have more time.

181
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,760
I would have to agree that neither of us have much time.

182
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,900
I need to ask you something now.

183
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,140
Lately, you've been driving a lot to Munich, isn't that correct?

184
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,460
That's right. What of it?

185
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,880
Please, Doctor, have a seat for a minute.

186
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,860
This won't take very long.

187
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,300
You've seen a psychologist named Reichwein three times this week.

188
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,600
Why so often?

189
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,400
Simple.

190
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,080
He was one of my professors from university.

191
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,080
Düsseldorf University.

192
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,420
Correct.

193
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,460
There was someone special in your class.

194
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,060
This one fellow student of yours who went on to become a brilliant neurosurgeon.

195
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,080
Where are you going with all this?

196
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,400
Have you met up with Dr. Tenma?

197
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,180
No. What are you talking about?

198
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,260
Allow me to refresh your memory.

199
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,700
Let's talk about our memories of cheating.

200
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,540
Rudy, you placed that classified ad in every leading newspaper in the country from May 1st to the 22nd.

201
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,020
Shocking. I never thought brilliant people like you or Dr. Tenma ever had to cheat.

202
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,220
Even as students, it seems out of character for the two of you.

203
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,900
It's interesting what best friends will do.

204
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,220
Inspector, I wouldn't say that Dr. Tenma and I were even friends when we attended Dusseldorf.

205
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,380
Last May in Odair Park, with your help, the Velber police were able to surround Dr. Tenma.

206
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,680
They were poised to take him into custody, but at the last second, he miraculously escaped.

207
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,700
Well, then you must also know that the wire I was wearing malfunctioned.

208
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,060
It's still possible that you might have helped him to escape.

209
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,340
Come on. I know that Tenma is innocent.

210
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,700
Really?

211
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,800
Have an open mind and listen to me.

212
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,920
The director of Eisler Memorial Hospital and three other people that were murdered in Dusseldorf.

213
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,980
The murder of a patient in a building under construction.

214
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,100
And the murder in Heidelberg.

215
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,660
The middle-aged couples that were murdered across the country.

216
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,920
Those were the works of a madman, not Tenma.

217
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,900
I reached this conclusion from interviewing Dr. Tenma in person, as a criminal psychologist.

218
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,740
Interesting.

219
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,520
So, where is he now?

220
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,660
Who knows. He's run off somewhere again.

221
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,360
Why did he run away?

222
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,300
Why would he run away if he were innocent?

223
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,720
He is innocent!

224
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,180
You think so?

225
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,220
He needs friends like you to help him, so why would he leave you in the dark?

226
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:16,660
Well, I have proof that he isn't the murderer you think he is. Have a look at this, Inspector.

227
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,120
I personally compiled this analysis of all the evidence in this case.

228
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,080
You're very thorough.

229
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,500
So tell me, do you understand my conclusion?

230
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,260
Yes.

231
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,640
A strange death of Farrin, the boy who pretended to be Shuvalt's son.

232
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,120
The seemingly accidental death of ex-police detective Richard Brown, who was investigating

233
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,780
this case.

234
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,560
The questions and rumors surrounding Shuvalt's illegitimate child.

235
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,340
There's a young man who's at the center of this entire case.

236
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,100
When Tenma was questioned by police, he named this young man as the real murderer.

237
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,640
Johann Liebert.

238
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,380
While he was still alive, Richard Brown discovered a gravestone of a person with that same first and last name in Bruntal.

239
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:38,980
Furthermore, someone who admitted to being a hitman tried to kill Dr. Reichwein after he picked up the investigation from where Brown had left off.

240
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,260
Oh, I understand quite well.

241
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,300
But you're wrong. It's impossible to actually prove that all these separate events are connected.

242
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,940
Tenma has gone into hiding because he understands this more than anyone does.

243
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,080
Am I wrong?

244
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,900
I keep noticing that you tap your fingers.

245
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:20,100
Oh. That's just a little habit I have. It helps me to remember important points in a case.

246
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,340
As a psychologist, it appears to me that your own anxiety is manifesting itself in the way

247
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,500
you constantly do it.

248
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,060
I do the same thing.

249
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,080
I use my recorder instead of my hand.

250
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,400
However, the sounds that are recorded on this device are absolutely objective.

251
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,600
But in your case, the information that you remember when you're drumming your fingers

252
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,800
has already been tainted by your own pre-set opinions.

253
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,300
That's probably how you've always done your job, Inspector.

254
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,340
for all these years, right up until now.

255
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,000
You believe that your memory is correct

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,820
and that your judgment couldn't possibly be wrong.

257
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,540
Do you have a wife or a family?

258
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,980
Any hobbies outside your work?

259
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,520
You live for your job, don't you?

260
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,280
Ever made a mistake?

261
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,740
Inside, aren't you terribly afraid to make a mistake?

262
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,260
The way you think, everything's black or white,

263
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,000
so Tenma has to be a bad person.

264
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
And if your judgment turned out to be wrong,

265
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,200
your whole world would fall apart.

266
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,840
You need to look at the truth.

267
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,060
This is a recent photograph of Johann Liebert.

268
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,460
Can you prove all the death surrounding Johann is just coincidence?

269
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,420
This young man, where would I find him this very moment?

270
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,000
He's a student at the University of Munich.

271
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,020
At the moment, he's Schubert's private secretary.

272
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,340
So this is him. I'll need to hold on to this photograph, Doctor.

273
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,120
From this point on, let's consider this a police matter.

274
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,100
You know, perhaps I made a terrible mistake.

275
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,920
Where is Dr. Tenma right now?

276
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,860
He should still be in Munich.

277
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,820
Yes, this is Lunge.

278
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,980
Put me through to the Munich police.

279
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,040
I need an emergency deployment.

280
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,800
Dr. Tenma is somewhere in the city of Munich.

281
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,320
(explosion booms)

282
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,120
- A sniper rifle?

283
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,260
Look, I don't got a clue what you're talking about.

284
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,440
- Wait, so Mr. Heitmeyer didn't call you

285
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,080
from his mountain villa in Fusen?

286
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,540
- 10,000 Deutschmarks in advance.

287
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,060
- Here.

288
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,600
your order is a little complicated for me to fill it'll take about a week to get it in the

289
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,500
meantime go get some Sun you look pale listen you're getting yourself a good piece but it's

290
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:36,180
a waste if you don't know how to use it just remember that next in the news city officials

291
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,340
attended a posh reception for the Munich Electronics Industry trade show that's

292
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,500
being hosted this weekend by the state's Chamber of Commerce in association with

293
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,860
local business leaders. Political and business figures from all over the world

294
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,540
are attending. With the formation of the EU, the various industries are poised to become the

295
00:21:54,540 --> 00:22:00,280
center of Munich's media network. This is the largest trade show Munich has ever hosted and the monetary

296
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,860
impact on the local economy from this event is in the millions. In a related

297
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,300
industrialist Hans-Georg Schuwald,

298
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,760
who hasn't appeared in public for nearly 20 years,

299
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,120
was seen at the reception and received

300
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,000
rousing applause from the attendees.

301
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,560
Mr. Schuwald was in a wheelchair, but he appeared healthy.

302
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,220
(eerie music)

303
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,220
[MUSIC]

304
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,280
[MUSIC]

305
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,600
(gentle music)
