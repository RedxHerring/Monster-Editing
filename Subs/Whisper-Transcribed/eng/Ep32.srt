Hey, Carl.

Oh, hi, Lota.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,700
Do you have a minute?

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,020
Not really, I'm running late.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,160
But what's up?

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,160
Nothing.

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,080
Maybe we could go and have a cup of coffee.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,740
I thought you might want to talk about how things are

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,920
going with you and your father.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,800
I mean, you were so worried before.

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,060
Not now.

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,840
I'm fine.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,600
Everything's good.

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,760
Yeah, but...

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,380
I'm off.

Sorry Lota, but I've got to get home.

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,380
My father has a business meeting and I have to take him to it.

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,640
See you later.

00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,400
Wait!

21
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,400
I bought tickets to a dance!

22
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,300
I was thinking...

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,360
maybe...

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,000
we could...

00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:51,760

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,920
She's come back here again.

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,560
I bet a beautiful girl like that doesn't have to worry about getting someone to take her to a dance.

33
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
Oh man, it's so unfair.

34
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,260

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,200
Come on, I'm closing up now!

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Yes, ma'am!

37
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,020
I've seen her. Can't remember where.

38
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,280
A dance?

39
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,460
Yeah. I guess that's what it's called. Normally I wouldn't be interested in that type of thing.

40
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,020
But a friend insisted that I buy some tickets.

I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to make it. Sorry.

I'm sure you won't have a problem finding someone to take you to the dance.

See you later, though.

Hello to Frank. I'm a Cultural Anthropology major.

50
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,240
And what about you?

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,060
Whoa! You've collected a mountain of information, Nina.

52
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,540
This page is about the accountant murder.

53
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,020
I also have a newspaper article on the Voice of God case.

54
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,420
And pages and pages on the middle-aged couple's serial murders.

55
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,100
You've done amazing research.

56
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,800
I was thinking mine was impressive, but you have me beat for sure.

57
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,380
Well, I've been researching all the unsolved murders in Bavaria

58
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,900
But at the moment, I need more information on the former prostitute Margot Langer.

59
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,040
Do you think you could help fill in the blanks?

60
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,240
Gee, I've told you pretty much all I know.

61

The child born to Margot Langer and the very wealthy Hans Schuwald

62
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,760
spent years in foster care, but was just recently recognized by his father

63
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,720
and accepted as his rightful heir.

64
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,300
Maybe he's the one responsible for the awful events surrounding Mr. Schuwald.

65
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,620
That's not possible. I'm 100% sure of it.

66
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
You're really obsessed with this.

67
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,760

Y-you really think so?

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,180
This isn't about some paper, is it?

70
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,180
To be perfectly honest with you, I'm looking for someone.

71
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,100
Hey, can I ask you something?

72
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,540
In your whole life, have you ever had to worry about anything?

73
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,120
I've been wondering, do beautiful girls like you always get everything they want without

74
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,900
lifting a finger?

75
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,160
Does it fall in your lap?

76
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,900
What are you trying to imply?

77
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,440
Just, well, you can probably get any guy you want and never have to spend a minute worrying

78
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,080
about it.

79
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,680
It's fine, okay?

80
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,420
I'm sure you don't have worries like me.

81
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,440
Just forget it, alright?

82
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,060
Oh, man. Life just seems to be so unfair.

83
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,760
Listen, come with me to the dance tonight. It'll be a lot of fun.

84
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,200
Normally I wouldn't come to these type of things, you know?

85

Come on, let's give it a chance.

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,060

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:16,940
Oh, boy.

102
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,540
Someone let the weirdos out.

103
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,980
Give me a break.

104
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,840
Who do you think you are trying to hit on, Nina?

105
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,280
Wait, Lota.

106
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,520
Nina, hold on a second.

107
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,220
How about the two of us hang out together tonight, you know?

108
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,260
Who, me?

109
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,480
He's made a mistake.

110
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,420
No, be happy about it.

111
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,100
Well, I'd better be going now.

112
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,080
Nina, wait!

113
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,860
Hey, he's really not my type. I mean, not even a little bit.

114
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,440
Stay with me, Nina, please.

115
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,920
Dang it!

116
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,800
It's kind of depressing. I don't think we're fitting in.

117
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,520
Really?

118
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,180
Oh yeah, really.

119
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,380
All those guys were talking to you, but one by one you pushed them away.

120
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,620
Come on, you're way too picky, Nina.

121
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,160
I wasn't consciously trying to be rude.

122
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,600
I guess it's just that... I'm out of practice.

123
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,580
Huh?

124
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,700
These guys all hang out together.

125
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,320
They're used to joking around and having fun, but for me, it's been a long time.

126
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,700
Nina, it sounds like...

127
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,380
You're pretty old-fashioned, despite the way you look.

128
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,500
Despite the way I look? And what exactly is that supposed to mean, Lota?

129
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,860
Hey, guess who's back? Wanna dance with me?

130
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,960
C'mon babe, what do you say?

131
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,860
Ew, please just go away. Leave me alone.

132
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,540
C'mon, don't be like that. Just one little dance.

133
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,300
Don't come any closer! You're drunk!

134
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,240
Hey, stop it! Let me go!

135
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,500
C'mon, cut it out!

136
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,820
Hey! You know, it's not like I'm asking because I dig you or anything.

137
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,080
You're a fine one to talk, buddy. You're just plain rude!

138
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,640
Come on, one stupid little dance. Let's get it over with.

139
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,560
Stop it! Come on, let me go!

140
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,860
If you don't dance with me, then I won't get paid.

141
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,340
Paid? To dance with me?

142
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,740
Yeah, but I'm not supposed to say anything. It's just between Carl and me.

143
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,980
You must have thought you wouldn't be able to find anyone who'd want to dance with you.

144
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,720
Carl did this?

145
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,760
Whatever. I'll dance with you.

146
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,860
So what do you say? Let's hit the dance floor.

147
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
I promise not to step on your toes.

148
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,800
Let me go.

149
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,520
Come on, sweetie. I know you don't mean that.

150
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,480
Please, stop it!

151
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,820
Give me one little song and I'm on my way.

152
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,700
Don't! I'm real sorry!

153
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,760
I won't ask anymore, I promise!

154
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,540
Let me go! Come on, please!

155
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,800
We're done.

156
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,220
I must be crazy.

157
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,240
I really liked Carl.

158
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,620
I even helped him get reunited with his father.

159
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,900
so much and I thought he liked me but ever since Mr. Schuwald acknowledged him as his true son he

160
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:48,560
he has no time for me he's busy with his father it's always his father

161
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:02,380
I feel so lost it hurts so much I never thought that getting rejected would ever feel like this

162
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,420
It's painful. Right now the world is full of pain.

163
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,000
But everything will be alright. I know it.

164
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,080
The bad things can't keep happening forever.

165
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,500
We have to do our part to stop them. Right?

166
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,740
"Cafe Vinyl"

167
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:18,160
I know what it is. About Nina. Why I thought I'd seen her somewhere before.

168
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,780
She looks just like Johan.

169
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,080
If this were a regular gun, you'd get high marks for skill, but in this case it's the

170
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,780
precision of the rifle rather than your ability, Doctor.

171
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,260
This weapon might not have tested well enough to be designated the official sniper rifle

172
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,660
of the German Army, but it can hit the center of a 5-centimeter target from 300 meters away,

173
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,680
even if you're an amateur.

174
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,320
I don't know what you're planning to shoot, but I'm going to give you a couple of pointers.

175
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,960
First, the closer you get to your target,

176
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,180
obviously, the better accuracy you'll have.

177
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,480
And, of course, you'll need to find a place

178
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,980
where you can get off a clear shot.

179
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,800
It comes with four .338 Lapua Magnum bullets.

180
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,740
But you won't have time to re-aim

181
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,240
and fire off all four of 'em.

182
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,720
Really, one shot's the most you're gonna get.

183
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,020
(waves crashing)

184
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,620
(birds chirping)

185
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,160
(eerie music)

186
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,780
(explosion booms)

187
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,020
(bird squawks)

188
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,680
- You come here every week.

189
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,680
So, are you an avid bird-watcher?

190
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,160
Uh, oh, yeah.

191
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't know why, but Thursday seems to be the most popular day of the week for visitors.

192
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,340
Like that old man with his two young companions over there. And you, too, of course.

193
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,400
I suspect you like the solitude of this forest.

194
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,160
Uh, I'm enjoying it. And yourself?

195
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,420
It's complicated.

196
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,160
Well, actually, I'm making amends with this place.

197
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,760
And I've been doing so for over 60 years.

198
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,320
I haven't seen him before.

199
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,260
From the looks of it, he didn't even take one bite of my special dish.

200
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,480
Gosh, that is such a shame.

201
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,160
Are you ready for a fabulous prize?

202
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,100
It's time to find out who knows the answers.

203
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Our first contestant is Max Feindler from Frankfurt.

204
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,880
And he's going to have a chance to win

205
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,240
a brand-new, fully-equipped RV.

206
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,740
Whoa! My family's been dreaming

207
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,620
about going camping in one for years.

208
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,240
Well, you'll be able to take them camping

209
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,920
every weekend in style.

210
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,560
But you have to answer all ten questions correctly

211
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,300
to receive your dream prize.

212
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,900
Ready for your first question.

213
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,700
Are you planning to sit here and stare at your food again?

214
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,480
You came in and did that about a week ago.

215
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,720
I make it my business to remember my customers.

216
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,720
If you don't have any appetite,

217
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,740
at least try some soup before you leave.

218
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,940
It's on the house.

219
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,640
Come on, you'd better eat.

220
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,800
Thank you for your concern.

221
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,800
I'll have a clear shot here.

222
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,660
I've got to take him out in this forest.

223
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,340
(gagging)

224
00:18:48,760 --> 00:19:00,040
- Ah, thank goodness.

225
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,100
I know every inch of this forest. I've walked here for so many years.

226
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,140
Well, I must be getting old.

227
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,580
You may not have an actual fracture. I've wrapped it up as a precaution.

228
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,080
But you should get an x-ray at the hospital, too.

229
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,420
I didn't peg you as a doctor.

230
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,680
When I first saw you, I thought you were a birdwatcher or maybe a hunter,

231
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,560
but that doesn't seem to be the case.

232
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,320
What are you talking about?

233
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,660
All the birds.

234
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,300
Huh?

235
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,520
They're gathering together overhead.

236
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,620
A long time ago,

237
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,340
all the wild birds would flock together

238
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,780
when a young boy appeared.

239
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,440
He would extend his arm like this

240
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,920
and the birds would come to him.

241
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,540
As a young boy growing up,

242
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,980
he'd spend his free time in the forest with the birds.

243
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,440
But then things changed, and Hitler's era came along.

244
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,740
The boy was now a young man and joined the police force.

245
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,200
He was convinced that the National Socialist German Workers' Party

246
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,540
would turn his bankrupt country into an ideal place.

247
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,620
Then out of the blue, this young man was given an order.

248
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,440
A vicious criminal had escaped into this very same forest.

249
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,620
And because he knew these woods so well, he was commanded to go out and find him.

250
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,920
"Shoot the violent criminal on sight," they told him.

251
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,940
The young policeman chased the criminal through the forest that he knew like the back of his hand.

252
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,640
He kept on and on until finally, there he was.

253
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,160
He had him cornered with his hands up.

254
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,740
Then he realized that the vicious criminal was actually just an ordinary man.

255
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,980
A foreigner.

256
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,220
The young man felt he had no choice but to obey without question.

257
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,320
So he carried out his order.

258
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,300
Since that day, the birds never came to rest on his arm again.

259
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,120
For sixty long years now, this man of the forest has been trying to make amends.

260
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

261
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,360
Apologize though he may, the birds refuse to ever come near him.

262
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,500
That's amazing.

263
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,020
It'll be okay now, little bird. It's your home. We respect it.

264
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,640
Never again will blood be shed in this forest.

265
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,900
Isn't that right?
