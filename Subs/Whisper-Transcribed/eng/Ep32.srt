1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,060
Hey, Carl.

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,420
Oh, hi, Lota.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,700
Do you have a minute?

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,140
Not really. I'm running late. But what's up?

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,060
Nothing. Maybe we could go and have a cup of coffee.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,920
I thought you might want to talk about how things are going with you and your father.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,780
I mean, you were so worried before.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,820
Not now. I'm fine.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,340
everything's good yeah I'm off sorry Lota but I've got to get home my father

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,580
has a business meeting and I have to take him to it see you later

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:29,800
We'll be right back.

12
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:39,820
♪♪♪

13
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:49,820
♪♪♪

14
00:01:49,820 --> 00:02:19,800
We'll see you next time.

15
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
You

16
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,980
Please finish up the library will be closing shortly. Oh, yeah

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
We're closing now

18
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,220
She's come back here again

19
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:56,440
I bet a beautiful girl like that doesn't have to worry about getting someone to take her to a dance man. It's so unfair

20
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,200
What is it about her come on? I'm closing up now. Yes, ma'am

21
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,820
I've seen her. Can't remember where.

22
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
A dance?

23
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
Yeah, I guess that's what it's called.

24
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
Normally I wouldn't be interested in that type of thing.

25
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
But a friend insisted that I buy some tickets.

26
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,820
I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to make it. Sorry.

27
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,820
Oh.

28
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
I have to go with my father to an official state banquet.

29
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
It's kind of an important political event.

30
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,820
I'm sure you won't have a problem finding someone to take you to the dance.

31
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,020
See you later, though.

32
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,660
No big deal. I didn't really want to go anyway.

33
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
You seem familiar.

34
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,820
Hey, wait.

35
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
It looks like you're doing research on Margot Langer.

36
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
Hey, I'm doing research on her, too.

37
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
I mean, we could share notes. Please don't erase anything.

38
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
I'm putting together data for a paper.

39
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
I'm Lotte Frank. I'm a cultural anthropology major.

40
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,820
And what about you?

41
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Whoa! You've collected a mountain of information, Nina.

42
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,380
Nina. This page is about the accountant murder. I also have a newspaper article on the Voice of

43
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,640
God case. And pages and pages on the middle-aged couple serial murders. You've done amazing

44
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,160
research. I was thinking mine was impressive, but you have me beat for sure. Well, I've been

45
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,140
researching all the unsolved murders in Bavaria over the last four years, but at the moment I

46
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,420
need more information on the former prostitute Margo Langer. Do you think you could help fill

47
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:19,340
the blanks gee i've told you pretty much all i know the child born to margot langer and the

48
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,380
very wealthy hans schuvald spent years in foster care but was just recently recognized by his

49
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,900
father and accepted as his rightful heir maybe he's the one responsible for the awful events

50
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:40,060
surrounding mr schuvald that's not possible i'm 100 sure of it i see you're really obsessed with

51
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,280
this. I mean, considering that the research is just for a paper that you have to write for your

52
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:55,800
class. You really think so? This isn't about some paper, is it? To be perfectly honest with you,

53
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,380
I'm looking for someone. Hey, can I ask you something? In your whole life, have you ever

54
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,440
had to worry about anything? I've been wondering, do beautiful girls like you always get everything

55
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,040
they want without lifting a finger does it fall in your lap what are you trying to imply just well

56
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,920
you can probably get any guy you want and never have to spend a minute worrying about it

57
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
it's fine okay i'm sure you don't have worries like me just forget it all right

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,040
man life just seems to be so unfair

59
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,600
Listen, come with me to the dance tonight

60
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,800
It'll be a lot of fun

61
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:52,220
Normally I wouldn't come to these type of things, you know

62
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,320
Come on, let's give it a chance

63
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,100
These guys will talk to me as long as they see I'm with you

64
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,800
Hey, turn around, everyone's looking at us

65
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,140
- Hey. - Well, go ahead. Talk to him.

66
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,760
I'll just take the leftovers.

67
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,680
- Lota, stop it already. - Hi.

68
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,940
See? You're a magnet.

69
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,360
Hi!

70
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm Constantine, the president of the Supernatural Phenomenon Club.

71
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,360
How you doing?

72
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,060
Oh, boy. Someone let the weirdos out.

73
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,660
Give me a break. Who do you think you are trying to hit on Nina?

74
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,900
Wait, Lota. Hold on a second.

75
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,820
- Huh? - How about the two of us hang out together tonight?

76
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,780
- You know? - Who, me?

77
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,780
He's made a mistake.

78
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,780
No, be happy about it.

79
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,780
Well, I better be going now.

80
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,780
Nina, wait!

81
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,780
Hey! He's really not my type!

82
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,780
I mean, not even a little bit!

83
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,780
Stay with me, Nina! Please!

84
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,780
Dang it!

85
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,780
It's kind of depressing. I don't think we're fitting in.

86
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,780
Really?

87
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,780
Oh yeah, really.

88
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,780
were talking to you but one by one you pushed them away come on you're way too

89
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,760
picky Nina I wasn't consciously trying to be rude I guess it's just that I'm

90
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,400
out of practice huh these guys all hang out together they're used to joking

91
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:23,540
around and having fun but for me it's been a long time Nina it sounds like

92
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,400
You're pretty old-fashioned, despite the way you look.

93
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,340
Despite the way I look?

94
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,480
And what exactly is that supposed to mean, Loda?

95
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,780
Hey, guess who's back?

96
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,860
Want to dance with me?

97
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,060
Come on, babe, what do you say?

98
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,880
Ew, please just go away. Leave me alone.

99
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,860
Come on, don't be like that.

100
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,540
Just one little dance.

101
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,280
Don't come any closer. You're drunk.

102
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,020
Yeah?

103
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,240
Hey, stop it! Let me go!

104
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,560
Come on, cut it out!

105
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,280
Hey!

106
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,780
You know, it's not like I'm asking because I dig you or anything.

107
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,100
You're a fine one to talk, buddy. You're just plain rude.

108
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,620
Come on, one stupid little dance. Let's get it over with.

109
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,560
Stop it! Come on, let me go!

110
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,840
If you don't dance with me, then I won't get paid.

111
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,340
Paid? To dance with me?

112
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,740
Yeah, but I'm not supposed to say anything.

113
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,740
It's just between Carl and me.

114
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,900
You must have thought you wouldn't be able to find anyone who would want to dance with you

115
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,740
Carl did this. Oh, whatever. I'll dance with you. So, what do you say? Let's hit the dance floor

116
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,040
It brown is not to step on your toes. Let me go. Come on, sweetie

117
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,420
I know you don't mean that stop it and give me one little song and I'm on my way

118
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,780
I won't ask anymore, I promise.

119
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,740
Let me go. Come on, please.

120
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,800
We're done.

121
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,320
I must be crazy.

122
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,240
I really liked Carl.

123
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,600
I even helped him get reunited with his father.

124
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,880
I liked him so much, and I thought he liked me.

125
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,860
But ever since Mr. Schuwald acknowledged him as his true son, he...

126
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,080
He has no time for me.

127
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,380
He's busy with his father.

128
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,440
It's always his father.

129
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,480
I feel so lost.

130
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,140
It hurts so much

131
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,460
I never thought that getting rejected would ever feel like this

132
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,680
It's painful

133
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,440
Right now the world is full of pain

134
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:19,120
But everything will be alright

135
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,040
I know it

136
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,100
The bad things can't keep happening forever

137
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,500
We have to do our part to stop them, right?

138
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,040
I have to be on my way now, so...

139
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,980
Wait! Tell me where I can reach you, Nina!

140
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,540
Oh, sorry, Lota, but I'm still trying to get my living arrangements figured out.

141
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,560
Promise me you'll give me a call. You know, when you get settled in.

142
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,440
Sure. I enjoyed spending the day with you.

143
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,440
I really hope you find the person you've been looking for.

144
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,440
I know what it is. About Nina.

145
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Why I thought I'd seen her somewhere before.

146
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,440
She looks just like Johan.

147
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:52,020
If this were a regular gun, you'd get high marks for skill.

148
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,780
But in this case, it's the precision of the rifle rather than your ability, Doctor.

149
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,240
This weapon might not have tested well enough to be designated the official sniper rifle of the German Army,

150
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,680
but it can hit the center of a 5-centimeter target from 300 meters away, even if you're an amateur.

151
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,320
I don't know what you're planning to shoot, but I'm going to give you a couple of pointers.

152
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,180
First, the closer you get to your target, obviously, the better accuracy you'll have.

153
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,700
And, of course, you'll need to find a place where you can get off a clear shot.

154
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,300
It comes with four .338 Lapo Magnum bullets.

155
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,500
But you won't have time to re-aim and fire off all four of them.

156
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,740
Really, one shot's the most you're gonna get.

157
00:13:50,180 --> 00:14:20,160
To be continued...

158
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:34,680
You come here every week.

159
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,680
So, are you an avid bird watcher?

160
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,160
Oh, yeah.

161
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't know why, but Thursday seems to be the most popular day of the week for visitors.

162
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,840
Like that old man with his two young companions over there.

163
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,360
And you too, of course.

164
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,420
I suspect you like the solitude of this forest.

165
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,420
Uh, I'm enjoying it.

166
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,060
And yourself?

167
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,400
It's complicated.

168
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,120
Well, actually, I'm making amends with this place.

169
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,780
And I've been doing so for over 60 years.

170
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I

171
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,860
Haven't seen him before

172
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:51,260
From the looks of it, he didn't even take one bite of my special dish.

173
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,460
That is such a shame.

174
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:25,180
Are you ready for a fabulous prize?

175
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,100

and he's going to have a chance to win a brand-new, fully-equipped RV.

178
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,560
Whoa, my family's been dreaming about going camping in Lourdes for years.

179
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,840
Well, you'll be able to take them to Lourdes

182
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:09,120
are you planning to sit here and stare at your food again you came in and did that about a week

183
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,700
ago. I make it my business to remember my customers. If you don't have any appetite,

184
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,660
at least try some soup before you leave. It's on the house. Come on, you'd better eat.

185
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,760
Thank you for your concern.

186
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:54,760
I'll have a clear shot here.

187
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,640
I've got to take him out in this forest.

Oh, thank goodness. I never thought I'd trip and fall. I know every inch of this forest. I've walked here for so many years. Well, I must be getting old.

194
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:15,060
You may not have an actual fracture. I've wrapped it up as a precaution. But you should get an x-ray at the hospital, too.

195
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:26,580
I didn't peg you as a doctor. When I first saw you, I thought you were a birdwatcher or maybe a hunter, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

196
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:35,540
That's really amazing.

197
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,300
What are you talking about?

198
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,700
Oh, the birds.

199
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,320
Huh?

200
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,500
They're gathering together overhead.

201
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,800
A long time ago, all the wild birds would flock together when a young boy appeared.

202
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,900
He would extend his arm like this, and the birds would come to him.

203
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,980
As a young boy growing up, he'd spend his free time in the forest with the birds.

204
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,420
But then things changed, and Hitler's era came along.

205
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,740
The boy was now a young man and joined the police force.

206
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,500
He was convinced that the National Socialist German Workers' Party would turn his bankrupt country into an ideal place.

207
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,620
Then out of the blue, this young man was given an order.

208
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,440
A vicious criminal had escaped into this very same forest.

209
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,620
And because he knew these woods so well, he was commanded to go out and find him.

210
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,920
Shoot the violent criminal on sight, they told him.

211
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,940
The young policeman chased the criminal through the forest that he knew like the back of his hand.

212
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,660
He kept on and on until finally, there he was.

213
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,160
He had him cornered with his hands up.

214
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,980
Then he realized that the vicious criminal was actually just an ordinary man, a foreigner.

215
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,580
It didn't matter.

216
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,240
The young man felt he had no choice but to obey without question.

217
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,300
So he carried out his order.

218
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,300
since that day the birds never came to rest on his arm again

219
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:29,120
for 60 long years now this man of the forest has been trying to make amends

220
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:40,440
i'm sorry i'm so sorry apologize though he may the birds refuse to ever come near him

221
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:56,460
That's amazing.

222
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,340
It'll be okay now, little bird.

223
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,020
It's your home. We respect it.

224
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,640
Never again will blood be shed in this forest.

225
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,920
Isn't that right?
