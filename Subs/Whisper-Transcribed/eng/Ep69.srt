1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,620
It's delicious. The best I've ever had.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,620
I'm very pleased you like it.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,220
It's our homemade lingonberry jam.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,720
My! Homemade?

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,160
I was told to show this to any visitors who enjoy the jam.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,100
This is a photo of the jam maker.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,680
Goodness! He made this?

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,660
Yes. His name is Conrad.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:29,980
There's a hillside in the middle of the town.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,180
not too far away to the south where many lingonberry bushes grow and over the

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,560
course of time eventually he bought up the whole place and no one found a

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,140
reason to complain about him laying claim to the land because his jam is so

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,940
delicious yes that's right but he's also an enjoyable man and one of the few

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,920
people I can call a friend it was his idea to show the photograph his way of

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,780
I'm adding a personal touch to say,

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,060
please enjoy our authentic homemade jam.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,340
(laughing)

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,360
- Well, his strategy is working.

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,080
We'll have to come back for jam, dear.

20
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,880
- Oh yes, absolutely.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,880
- I'll tell him the next time we play chess.

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,800
He'll be very happy to hear that.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,000
(dramatic music)

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,200
[MUSIC]

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,520
[MUSIC]

26
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,460
(dramatic music)

27
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,420
I wonder if there will be an attack on this peaceful little town.

28
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,820
An attack? There are other methods besides that.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,260
There are cases where a single gun has destroyed a whole town.

30
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,560
1958, in Zweifelsstadt.

31
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,860
There was a series of murders in the state of Niedersachsen.

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,900
The townspeople began to suspect their neighbors of being the killer.

33
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,700
It left them on edge in a constant state of group hysteria.

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,140
one of the residents became so paranoid

35
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,180
that he ended up shooting his next-door neighbor

36
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,300
with a gun he had purchased for protection.

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,780
Nobody could stop it after that.

38
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,740
A fire was lit in the town,

39
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,620
and everything on hand was used as a weapon.

40
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,560
The townspeople massacred each other,

41
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,700
and there was not one survivor left.

42
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,800
Don't tell me that's going to happen here as well.

43
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,740
Because of one man.

44
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,160
We have to stop it before it starts.

45
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,420
No. I'm afraid it's too late. It might have already begun.

46
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,780
Come on! Give us your money! We know you got some, so cough it up!

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,420
No, please! That's the money for my...

48
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,720
It's your drunk dad's liquor money, isn't that right?

49
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,700
Tell your dad drinking isn't good for his health!

50
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,180
We're doing him a favor!

51
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,700
(laughing)

52
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,400
- What a wuss.

53
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,200
- Yeah.

54
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,780
- Well, let's get something to eat.

55
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,720
- Sounds good.

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,740
- What are you gonna get?

57
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,980
- Wanna go for the usual?

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,600
Got plenty to spend.

59
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,060
- Yeah.

60
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,100
- Little boy.

61
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,980
Don't you hate them?

62
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,240
Don't you hate them enough to kill them?

63
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,060
- Where do you think you're going?

64
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,120
- I'm going to have a little talk with Conrad.

65
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:53,880
- Talk?

66
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,260
What are you gonna talk to him about?

67
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,500
- When we passed the cafe,

68
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,100
didn't you notice that Ralph

69
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,620
and all of his customers inside

70
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,240
were sitting there glaring at us?

71
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,540
- Well, maybe they were just surprised

72
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,660
to see us out together.

73
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,900
That hardly ever happens.

74
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,740
- No, that can't be it.

75
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,180
Who knows what they might do

76
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,000
if they found out we had just won the lottery

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,860
and made 20 million marks.

78
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,780
- You mean, you think?

79
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,560
- That's why I wanna have this topic

80
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,260
out in the open once and for all.

81
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,580
I'm about ready to jump out of my skin here.

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,660
- Okay, for argument's sake,

83
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,460
let's just say that Conrad does know we won the lottery.

84
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,900
What on earth are you gonna do about it?

85
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,360
- I'll pay him whatever amount of money he wants.

86
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,820
I think that should do the trick to shut him up.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,120
- But then what if Conrad gets greedy

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,740
and keeps squeezing us for more hush money later on?

89
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,900
- If that happens--

90
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,520
- What are you gonna do about it then, huh?

91
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,760
- I don't know.

92
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,760
Speaking of Conrad, isn't this the place where he picks all his lingonberries?

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,780
Uh, honey?

94
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,280
What?

95
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,160
You don't really think Conrad is a bad person, do you?

96
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
Uh, no.

97
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,240
I mean, he's not the kind of person who would ruin our good fortune

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,980
now that our ship has finally come in.

99
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,500
Well, what do you think?

100
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,600
Hmm?

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,140
(crickets chirping)

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,980
- What are you looking at?

103
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:22,700
(crickets chirping)

104
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,600
(gasps)

105
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,740
Oh, oh dear, you didn't, did you?

106
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,100
- Of course I didn't.

107
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,080
- Oh my God, I can't stand it, this is too much.

108
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,160
- Listen, I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

109
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,020
- Well then who else would have done it?

110
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,080
- How should I know?

111
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,260
I just bought my gun, never been fired.

112
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,620
(sobs)

113
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,760
(barking)

114
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
- Oh, shut up.

115
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,520
God damn, that dog pisses me off.

116
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,400
Shut up, you old fleabag.

117
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,500
(barking)

118
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,800
- Well, you sure seem happy today.

119
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,820
Did something good happen?

120
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,980
Come on, spill the beans.

121
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,580
- Yeah, he finally showed up.

122
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,680
- Wait, who are you talking about?

123
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,540
- The perfect man who's going to take me

124
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,180
far away from this boring town.

125
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,140
(laughing)

126
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,880
- A drink, need a drink, oh damn.

127
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,580
They all look at me and laugh.

128
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,840
I'm just a big joker on this place, isn't that right?

129
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,320
But it's not funny at all, huh?

130
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
God, I need a drink.

131
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,400
Would this be what you really want?

132
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,060
You want this, don't you?

133
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,440
Your boy already took one. This one's yours.

134
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,940
[DOG BARKING]

135
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,020
[GUNSHOT]

136
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,340
A gunshot, and the dog's barking suddenly stopped.

137
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,260
[APPLAUSE]

138
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,400
Mr. Lipsky.

139
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,160
You're Franz Bonaparte's son, isn't that so, Mr. Lipsky?

140
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,120
Please, tell me where to find your father.

141
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
If I don't hurry and find him,

142
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,980
very soon a lot of people are going to die.

143
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,160
You know, don't you, Mr. Lipsky?

144
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,380
You know where your father is.

145
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,640
I suppose that puppet is modeled after Nina, isn't it?

146
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,660
I knew that you would be here. Nina told me where to find you.

147
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,120
Nina told you?

148
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,900
Could you open those for me?

149
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,380
Sure.

150
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,440
How long have I been like this?

151
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,360
Don't worry about it. You could use some more rest. It's important that you get it.

152
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,680
I want to thank you all that time. I could tell you were there watching out for me somehow

153
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,460
Please don't worry. I'm all right now. I

154
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,980
Don't want to die anymore

155
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:54,220
Dr.. Reich fine and Dieter should both be arriving here pretty soon now and you I have things to do. Where are you going?

156
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,980
I'm working on that

157
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,060
You've been looking over lots of documents that you've found.

158
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,460
Did you learn anything?

159
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,880
I'll be fine. You can tell me what you know.

160
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,160
I had some members of Prague's former secret police organization,

161
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,080
as well as some of General Wolf's men,

162
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,760
track down as much information as they were able to find.

163
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,440
You mean about Franz Bonaparta?

164
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,840
That's right. He's a very mysterious man,

165
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,500
a bit of a profile on him.

166
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,780
A German-born Czech.

167
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,580
It appears that the name Franz Bonaparte

168
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,780
is also an alias.

169
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,220
After World War II,

170
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,060
when most German-born Czechs

171
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,820
were chased from their homeland of Bohemia,

172
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,800
his family remained within the country.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,260
It's unclear what kind of a role he served

174
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,240
in the communist Czechoslovakian government.

175
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,640
I discovered that he was once married to a Czech woman

176
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:04,260
they had a son. When their son was just a boy, he participated in the very first

177
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,940
book readings, the experimental testing that was run throughout the mid-60s by

178
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:16,080
his father. Franz Bonaparte's son is still living in Prague. Those were Peter

179
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,180
Čapek's last words to me, and in spite of everything, I believe he was telling me

180
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,800
the truth. I'm gonna show you something that I managed to find. It's a copy of an

181
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,540
This is an old photograph of the first round of pupils who were there and took part in the '60s book readings.

182
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,020
Apparently, the little boy on the far left of the photo was...

183
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,400
Not a superior pupil.

184
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,360
He was kicked out of the readings because he wasn't a superior pupil.

185
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,720
You already knew?

186
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,460
That made him an unwanted child of no use to Bonaparta.

187
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,260
I'm pretty sure that his son is the man I stayed with in Prague.

188
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,720
Assuming that he is Bonaparta's son,

189
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,200
Do you think he'd have an idea of where his father is?

190
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,480
I don't know, but he's the only possible lead we have right now.

191
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,120
And we have to hurry before something terrible happens.

192
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,520
Something terrible?

193
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,440
Yes, quite soon, I can tell.

194
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,320
I know what Johan is about to attempt.

195
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,080
What is it? Tell me.

196
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,280
The perfect suicide.

197
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,620
True solitude.

198
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,980
The only expression of love.

199
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,820
If we don't hurry, many innocent people are going to die.

200
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,260
Your bookshelves.

201
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,640
They're full of storybooks that Franz Bonaparte drew under pen names.

202
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,780
I've actually read almost all the stories myself.

203
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,580
And after reading several of them, it suddenly began to dawn on me.

204
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,980
For some reason, all of the characters that appear in his books have German names.

205
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,300
Even in Klaus Poppe's "The God of Peace," he uses them.

206
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,500
But the problem in this instance is the Klaus Poppe pen name.

207
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,060
Franz Bonaparta and all of the other pseudonyms that he wrote under were Czechoslovakian.

208
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,440
This is the only German pen name he ever employed.

209
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,240
Just maybe Klaus Poppe was actually the true name of your German-born Czechoslovakian father.

210
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,800
There was a detective who used that same line of reasoning

211
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,220
and also concluded that was my father's real name.

212
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,100
Detective?

213
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,980
He said he was Inspector Lungay of the BKA.

214
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,480
Lungay? Is he still here?

215
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,480
He was here weeks ago. He already left.

216
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,420
Where did he go?

217
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,320
He made this deduction.

218
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,680
No, actually, with him it was more like he became my father,

219
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,940
rather than using logic.

220
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,120
I am now Klaus Poppe.

221
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,980
I have no place that I can return to.

222
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,300
I will go back to my heart's one true home," he said.

223
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,780
Many years ago, the German-born Czechs

224
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,600
were driven from their home in Bohemia

225
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,140
when Germany lost the war.

226
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,760
Where in Germany were his ancestors originally from?

227
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm not too sure of the location.

228
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,600
All I remember is my father once said to me

229
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,760
when I was very young,

230
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,280
"Our home is a small town in southern Germany

231
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,480
surrounded by many mountains."

232
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,440
I didn't want it anymore,

233
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,520
So I gave it to Inspector Lunge, a postcard I got three or four years ago.

234
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,200
The address of the sender was not included.

235
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,400
All it had was a hand-painted picture of some mountains with the initials "K.P."

236
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,320
K.P. Klaus Poppe. Could be.

237
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,620
I'm sorry to say that's all I really know.

238
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,060
Southern Germany. A town surrounded by mountains.

239
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,000
Will... will my... father be killed?

240
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,920
I can't tell you.

241
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,380
But I do know that it won't end there.

242
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,460
And Nina? Is Nina safe and sound?

243
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,780
I hope so.

244
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,340
I want to create plays for this puppet that always have happy endings.

245
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,500
Please, just keep Nina safe.

246
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,480
I will.

247
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,680
Can you tell me what's going to happen?

248
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,380
He's trying...

249
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,280
Johan's trying to recreate them.

250
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,580
Red Rose Mansion. Endless slaughter back at 5-1-1 Kinderheim.

251
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,520
Please listen.

252
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,400
No matter what happens, Tenma, come back.

253
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,480
You saved me and I'll never forget it.

254
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,440
You have to live.

255
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,960
The rain...

256
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,160
It started.

257
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:55,240
Give me a drink, I need some booze, damn it.

258
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,360
Well what's going on?

259
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,300
Did the police find Conrad's body yet?

260
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,440
No, they've labeled him missing and they've gone out looking for him.

261
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,240
- I knew we shouldn't have hidden the body in the forest.

262
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,800
We should have just gone straight to the police.

263
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,900
- What's the use of saying that now?

264
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,980
I think you're forgetting,

265
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,460
you're the one who thought I'd shot him.

266
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,220
Damn it!

267
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,480
This is what we get for winning the lottery.

268
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,360
- I keep on telling you,

269
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,340
you shouldn't have bought these horrible things.

270
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,840
- No use waiting.

271
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
There won't be any trains.

272
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,840
The Elgar River has flooded out the railway bridge.

273
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,580
All roads are closed due to the flooding as well.

274
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,320
A solitary island.

275
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,680
The worst possible scenario.

276
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,480
Klaus Poppe, is it?

277
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,060
Do you know about him?

278
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,660
Jakob Feuerbach.

279
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,260
And Emil Scherbeck.

280
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,840
Do you know about them? Because I think they and Poppe are the same man.

281
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,900
matter in art are different in each. When you've seen as much as I have, you notice

282
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,580
certain things. However, I couldn't tell you why he would use so many pen names, though.

283
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,140
His art is good. But for some reason, I really can't appreciate his work. There are plenty

284
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:27,420
of picture books around the world that have gloomy stories. But somehow, his art... different.

285
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,200
- How so? What do you mean? - Hmm. I guess you could say they're brimming

286
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:46,440
with malice. Before I forget, there's another one. This storybook from Helmuth Foss, published

287
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:53,120
in Germany in 1989. It's hard to get because there were so few printed, but I believe he

288
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,580
is also the same man as Klaus Poppe. How can you be sure about that? As I said, I'm able

289
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,880
to tell these things. When you do it long enough, you know. No matter how he changes

290
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,680
his art, there are little things that always remain the same. This story's content is

291
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,860
an about-face from the others. A thief sneaks into a quiet village in the mountains. He

292
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,500
plans to make off with a good sum of money from the villagers. But as he interacts with

293
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,000
the people of the village, he forgets how to steal, and eventually he ends up leading

294
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,580
a quiet life, helping the village folks. The title is "The Peaceful House."

295
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,960
Pope's usual unpleasant aftertaste is gone. However, his artwork takes quite a

296
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,720
turn for the worse. A bit of a strange thing happened. It

297
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,500
seems his story got better, but he forgot how to draw.

298
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,380
It's as if... as if he lost his purpose.

299
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,380
A peaceful home. A village in the mountains.

300
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,860
"Our home is a small town in southern Germany, surrounded by many mountains."

301
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,140
"A map."

302
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,960
"Hm?"

303
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,220
"Do you happen to have a map of southern Germany?"

304
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,340
"So what are you looking for?"

305
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,120
"A small town surrounded by many mountains.

306
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,540
There it is."

307
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,100
"Hm."

308
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,080
"Ruhenheim."

309
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,260
(dramatic music)

310
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,960
- Holy cow, it's a monsoon out there.

311
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,200
- So how did it go?

312
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,060
Were you able to locate Conrad in all that rain?

313
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,920
- Nope, not a trace.

314
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,060
My partners are still looking around,

315
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,360
but given the way it's been raining all afternoon,

316
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
the overflowing river's taking the trains

317
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,000
and roads out of service.

318
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,160
I know you must be concerned about your friend.

319
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,700
I mean, normally, this place is just so peaceful.

320
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,880
But then Conrad goes missing, and the next thing you know,

321
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,700
Mrs. Hillman's dog is shot dead.

322
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,340
Poor Mrs. Hillman is so distraught,

323
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,920
she's confined to her bed with grief.

324
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,360
And that's not all.

325
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,300
Mr. Kemnar was attacked leaving the pub last night.

326
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,620
I hear his condition is serious.

327
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,840
And the perp got away.

328
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,700
We got nothing.

329
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,760
If he should actually die as a result of those injuries,

330
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,980
it will be this town's first ever murder.

331
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,500
Things are falling apart and because of this rain we can't get back up.

332
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,780
What are we supposed to do with only a few people?

333
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,340
It must be the work of outsiders.

334
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,280
Crime in this town is basically non-existent.

335
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,000
It's gotta be them, right?

336
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,500
We're outsiders. Are you locking us up?

337
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,320
No, I'm not suggesting that.

338
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,360
This rain is fierce.

339
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,580
I can hardly go outside in my wheelchair in this weather.

340
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,720
Well, I'd better go patrol one more time and then catch up with my partners.

341
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,280
Be careful out there.

342
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,540
Your husband's shoes are remarkably muddy and wet.

343
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,480
As if he'd been spending time walking around in the rain.

344
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,500
I'd like to use your phone, if I may.

345
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,180
Huh?

346
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,420
Uh, it's just that lush.

347
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,980
Can't be him. He can't do anything at all.
