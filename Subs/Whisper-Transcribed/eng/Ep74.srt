1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:08,020
From Mount Olympus, Zeus commanded his mortal subjects to live off the land.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,740
They obeyed, and--

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,900
Stop, Carl. Your recitation is so stilted.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,200
Sorry, Father. I guess I was trying to be careful.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,540
But you have improved.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,420
When you first came, I thought to myself,

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,800
"Why in the world did such an unimpressive student show up here?"

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,140
Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,600
Whatever happened to him?

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,300
What happened to that Japanese doctor?

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,760
Actually, I've heard he's traveling quite a bit now, Father.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,500
I see.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,680
You know, I'd really like to meet Dr. Tenma one more time.

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,760
Me too.

15
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:11,960
(dramatic music)

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,620
(dramatic music)

17
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,920
(birds chirping)

18
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,960
(bell tolling)

19
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,640
So you've started a job? Glad to hear it.

20
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,500
What kind of work are you doing?

21
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,240
I'm an interior designer these days.

22
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,180
Oh, I see. You do seem like someone

23
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,720
who would have a very keen eye for arranging a home.

24
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,080
I am working in homes,

25
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,500
but it's a little different from what you're thinking.

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,280
Hmm?

27
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,900
Well, I specialize in kitchens.

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,960
Ah.

29
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,840
Funny, isn't it?

30
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,700
A person like me who had no idea

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,660
I've never even stood in a kitchen before.

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,940
- Well, do you think you'd consider

33
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,560
remodeling my kitchen sometime?

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,260
- Sure, why not?

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,320
- But with your expensive tastes,

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,080
I bet your kitchens must come at quite a steep price.

37
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,620
- I like the best.

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,080
(laughing)

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,440
- You're not drinking anymore, are you?

40
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,680
- No, not a single drop.

41
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,940
- That's good news.

42
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,700
Try to take your time and enjoy your life.

43
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,640
Even if we rush, tomorrow we'll arrive

44
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,000
Same as always.

45
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
You've always said that's what real happiness is.

46
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,960
Haven't you?

47
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,720
That I have.

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,760
Happiness...

49
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,480
I can't forget his words.

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,180
He said that he was happy just knowing I was waiting for him at the station.

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,080
Ah, this is Martin you're talking about.

52
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,300
People are such strange beings.

53
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,760
The sad memories seem to just fade away

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,880
until all the persons left with are the happier ones.

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,300
People are certainly designed so conveniently.

56
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,320
That's the whole reason we can keep on living.

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll introduce you. Meet Mr. Werdemann. He's a lawyer. He's the one who was ultimately

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,720
responsible for clearing your name, Mr. Grimmer.

59
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,780
I did do some research and found out as much as I could about you. You were one of the

60
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,000
children from 511 Kinderheim. You worked secretly as an intelligence agent for the East Germans

61
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,680
traveled the world posing as a freelance journalist.

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,100
After retiring, you used your skills

63
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,020
to investigate human rights violations.

64
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,880
Your duffel bag was bursting at the seams

65
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,080
with papers and documents supporting your work.

66
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,460
But in all your investigating,

67
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,920
the one mystery you were never able to unravel

68
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,420
was that of your real name.

69
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,640
- Wolfgang Grimmer.

70
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,380
- His name wasn't the only mystery.

71
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,800
He left without telling us anything about himself.

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,780
Inspector Lungay.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,260
I'm no longer an inspector, Detective Suk.

74
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,640
Oh, well, sir, you haven't retired, though.

75
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,900
I heard that you're a professor at the police academy.

76
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,520
True, I have other priorities.

77
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,740
I talk to my daughter more now.

78
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,280
Well, email, technically.

79
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,060
We lived our lives without knowing anything about one another.

80
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,440
For years, we never discussed anything.

81
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,340
Only one thing matters to people.

82
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,820
It's all about how much we can communicate during our lives.

83
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,140
Grimmer probably had lots of things he wanted to talk about

84
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,240
over a good beer.

85
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,840
You're going back to live in Dusseldorf?

86
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,140
I am. The company that hired me is located there.

87
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,960
Oh, I see. Hmm. Are you comfortable with that?

88
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,520
After all, a lot of things happened to you there.

89
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,580
There's no use in running away.

90
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,400
You said what's important is to face the truth and move forward.

91
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,260
Didn't you?

92
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,800
Mm-hmm.

93
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,180
Could you dispose of this notebook properly for me, Doctor?

94
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,320
Sure.

95
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,840
Thank you.

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,860
You're welcome. And best of luck.

97
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,360
Please, call me if there's anything you need.

98
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,780
Remember that Dr. Gillen and I are always here to help you.

99
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,100
Dieter is, too. And him.

100
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,360
Do give him my regards.

101
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,580
The questioning of Dr. Tenma is still continuing, but the real truth is still unknown.

102
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,960
Inspector Lunge begins his testimony on the Tenma case.

103
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,160
Could this possibly be the worst multiple homicide case in European history?

104
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,400
Dr. Tenma is found innocent of any crimes.

105
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,700
a formal apology to Dr. Tenma.

106
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,680
The motive for these murders still remains unclear.

107
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,340
Just who is the mysterious young man

108
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,180
who's allegedly the real culprit?

109
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,900
Munster University's medical school

110
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,120
invites Dr. Tenma to become a professor.

111
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,680
Dr. Tenma declines the school's offer firmly.

112
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,900
Dr. Tenma joins the aid group Doctors Without Borders.

113
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,940
The articles become shorter and shorter.

114
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,680
People are certainly designed conveniently, huh?

115
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,060
Hey there, Deeter.

116
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,940
You've grown a lot since the last time I saw you.

117
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,440
Hey, Mr. Heckle.

118
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,660
You've gotten a lot sleazier since the last time I saw you.

119
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,720
I see you've still got that smart mouth, don't you?

120
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,760
Sorry, I can't chat now.

121
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,400
I've got soccer practice.

122
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,960
Hold on.

123
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Hey, wait a second!

124
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,880
Isn't Tenma back in town yet?

125
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,800
He went and joined the MSF.

126
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,860
'Cause he's trying to make himself look good by doing something that doesn't make any money.

127
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,660
And I can't even get a hold of him.

128
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,000
What if he is back?

129
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,920
Then I'll tell him to his face.

130
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,940
The money he gave me for this job I'm doing for him isn't enough to cover all my expenses and labor.

131
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,380
He asked you to do a job for him?

132
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,640
He said he just needed me to look for somebody.

133
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,540
And it sounded like an easy job.

134
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,960
Confidential stuff from the police who knows what'll happen if they catch me

135
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,960

Dieter

137
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:12,280
You give this bill to tenma and if he doesn't pay it I'll see to it that he ends up an underground doctor again

138
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,860
Tell him I'm not kidding

139
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,800
We've been wondering where you went.

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,780
You haven't stopped by for quite a while.

141
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,260
I'm sorry, I've been out of the country lately.

142
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,120
Here, I brought this back to share with everybody.

143
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,300
My, my, you really shouldn't have.

144
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,160
Oh, thank you.

147
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,060
(birds chirping)

148
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,800
- It's a beautiful day.

149
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,000
So many of the leaves are photosynthesizing.

150
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,220
That's life, all those countless genes.

151
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,440
Are you familiar with Mendel's work?

152
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,740
- Yes, he's a famous geneticist.

153
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,880
- That's correct.

154
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,960
I studied at the same university Mendel attended in his day.

155
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,580
in the Czech Republic.

156
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,800
It's down southeast in Moravia.

157
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,480
It's a nice city.

158
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,400
I'd like to see it someday.

159
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,040
I thank you.

160
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,560
You've come to visit me many times.

161
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,660
I've so enjoyed the time I've spent with you.

162
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,800
It's nothing.

163
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
I feel wonderful today.

164
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,120
I feel like I can talk about anything.

165
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,320
No matter how terrifying.

166
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,280
And you...

167
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,060
You have something you want to ask me, don't you?

168
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,740
Yes, I do.

169
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,560
You're the mother of the twins, aren't you?

170
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,680
Yes.

171
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,060
I loved him so much,

172
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,580
and he was killed by that man.

173
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,440
It was all part of his experiment.

174
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,360
I will never forgive him, not for what he did.

175
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,400
Even if I die, these children growing inside of me will punish that man for what he's done.

176
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,460
He will definitely pay for everything that he's done to us.

Are the twins still... they're alive, aren't they?

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,460
Yes. They will.

181
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,960
I just remembered.

182
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,220
You can tell me if you like.

183
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:59,060
I might not remember this ever again if I don't say it now.

184
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,720
I gave names to both of those children.

185
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,660
And I'll tell you what their names are.

186
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,220
Yes, come in.

187
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,480
Well, as usual, I see that you are tardy.

188
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,200
You are ten minutes late for our appointment.

189
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,380
I'm sorry, Professor Kronecker.

190
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,080
Your apology is accepted.

191
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,400
You know why I called you in today, don't you?

192
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,240
It's about your senior thesis.

193
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,320
Without a good grade on it, you will not graduate.

194
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,420
Please come forward.

195
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:06,980
Yes.

196
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,940
I know a lot has happened to you this semester.

197
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,820
It's unrealistic to expect you'd be able to catch up with all the time you were gone.

198
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,840
I understand. But I know that that's no excuse for my grades.

199
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,360
You are quite right.

200
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,460
Now, regarding the matter of your thesis...

201
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,300
superb.

202
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,980
This thesis is far and away the best paper written by any of my students

203
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,100
I'm quite proud of you. You have done an exceptional job.

204
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,320
Thank you very much, Professor.

205
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,640
What do you want to become?

206
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,780
I want to become a lawyer, sir.

207
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,680
Well, I imagine that a great many people will be saved by your skills.

208
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,900
And now you may go.

209
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,160
Yes, sir.

210
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,000
However, don't think you'll be allowed to be tardy for court,

211
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,020
Fräulein Nina Fortner.

212
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,360
Right.

213
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,660
Yes, hello?

214
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,620
Oh, hey Dieter.

215
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,420
Will, are you graduating?

216
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,540
Even if you aren't, I'll stick with you.

217
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,920
Will, it's good to hear from you.

218
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,620
Sure that. The next time we're together, you can try and cheer me up.

219
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,660
You can't fool me. I can tell you did from your voice. Congratulations, Nina.

220
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,380
Thank you, Dieter. But once I'm in law school, the real studying begins.

221
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,000
Let's celebrate. Come home already.

222
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:08,720
I can't come home for at least another day. I've got work. And I've already made plans with my friends.

223
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,900
What are you talking about? Tenma's coming back to see us.

224
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,840
Nina? Tenma just called. He's heading abroad soon for the MSF, but first he's coming here.

225
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,180
When?

226
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,820
He said he'd be here by tomorrow. So you better hurry!

227
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,620
Oh, Nina! About our plans for tomorrow?

228
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,100
Sorry, won't be able to go!

229
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,500
Tenma! I'm going to see Tenma!

230
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,880
(panting)

231
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,140
- Oh, good afternoon, Doctor.

232
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,160
- Good afternoon.

233
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You've been sleeping ever since that day you were shot.

234
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,080
Can you hear me?

235
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,600
I had the opportunity to talk with your mother.

236
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,540
She still loves you very much.

237
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,280
Sh-She told me what your real name is, Johan.

238
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,780
You have a name.

239
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,560
Dr. Tenma, there's something I want only you to hear.

240
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,180
That time, long ago, when the monster appeared in front of me.

241
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,660
Don't touch my children!

242
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,760
Don't you come near us!

243
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
This is an experiment.

244
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,680
We will leave one behind and take the other one with us.

245
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,080
This is an experiment.

246
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,380
Now, which one are we going to take?

247
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,080
Don't let go.

248
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,060
Don't let go...

249
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,220
Don't let go...

250
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,540
Don't let go...

251
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,540
Don't let go...

252
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,340
This one...

253
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,460
No, wait...

254
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,780
This one!

255
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,080
No!

256
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,200
Was my mother really trying to save me that day, or did she confuse me with my sister?

257
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,940
Well, which is it? Which one of us didn't she need?

258
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,440
(breathing heavily)

259
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,920
- Well then, I guess this is goodbye.
