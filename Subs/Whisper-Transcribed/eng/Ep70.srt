1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,060
(rain pouring)

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,140
- You got left high and dry by your mom.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,860
- Yeah, your mom threw out you and your drunk dad

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,560
like you were a big pile of trash.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,140
- So don't try to come out of the garbage can again.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,380
(laughing)

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,420
(laughing)

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,400
(choral music)

9
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,200
(dramatic music)

10
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,360
(horse neighing)

11
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,100
- Sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

12
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,340
then pay off your tab first.

13
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,940
- Wait, wait, wait, I've got money.

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,160
Enough for today's drinks.

15
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
- Listen, I'm not gonna let you buy drinks here

16
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,700
with money that you stole from your son.

17
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,240
- What did you say?

18
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,820
- Just get out of here.

19
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,120
(spits)

20
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,780
- He's suspicious.

21
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,380
- You mean, how Conrad's missing?

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,520
- And Mrs. Hillman's dog, too.

23
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,580
Do you think he did it?

24
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,420
He's too gutless to shoot anything.

25
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,180
Yeah, he's a coward and a drunk.

26
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,520
Oh, man. We're not gonna find him here.

27
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,220
Hey, Merkle! Let's call off the search for today, yeah?

28
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,060
Hey, Merkle, you there?

29
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,660
(thunder rumbling)

30
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,080
- Hey, I found Mr. Conrad!

31
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,200
- Mirko, where'd you go?

32
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,320
- What the?

33
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,380
What happened?

34
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,280
(thunder rumbling)

35
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,480
This is Lopper! Emergency! Please respond!

36
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,880
Someone! Someone answer for God's sake!

37
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,500
You look surprised. I think I'd better take that gun of yours.

38
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,060
That drunk's too gutless to shoot anything.

39
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,020
You got that right.

40
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,700
Yeah, he's a coward and a drunk.

41
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:04,620
All over town there are countless corpses, it's like a war zone.

42
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,180
Oh my god, Vim, what just happened?

43
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,420
Easy now, you're alright.

44
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,680
It's me.

45
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,320
I just...

46
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,060
I...

47
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,780
Relax.

48
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:41,850
now let go of the gun I don't remember what happened did I really shoot them I

49
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,900
mean they were always bullying me so I

50
00:05:51,460 --> 00:06:00,140
you didn't shoot them I didn't are you sure huh it's all right

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,980
Try to calm down. You're going to be fine.

52
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,420
There's nothing to be afraid of, Vim.

53
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,860
Now try to remember what happened.

54
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,640
Who did you get this gun from?

55
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,120
Try to stay conscious, Laufer.

56
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,480
It's amazing that you made it all the way here with your leg shot like that.

57
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,740
Please, just call the station.

58
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,760
The telephone doesn't work.

59
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,500
My God, the guy took it from me.

60
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,400
Was he somebody from around here?

61
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,080
I'd never seen this guy before.

62
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,040
We'd better do some first aid on that leg.

63
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,580
These are your friends, aren't they?

64
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,640
What do you mean by that?

65
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,220
How many of your friends have come here to this town?

66
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,940
Just what are you trying to suggest?

67
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,900
Only that you've scattered quite a few guns around.

68
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,800
You even went and forced a gun on this poor innocent boy.

69
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,620
Vim? A gun? Tell me you didn't use it!

70
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,840
You're definitely not trash, Vim.

71
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,720
Don't bother with those bullies.

72
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,340
You were born for a reason, I know it.

73
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,640
You told him all of those things to encourage Vim to feel good about himself.

74
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,440
You'll be glad to know he didn't shoot this gun.

75
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,560
All the bullets are still in it.

76
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,040
I would say Vim took that good advice of yours to heart.

77
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
You did the right thing.

78
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,140
It's alright, Vim. You're a good boy.

79
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,760
There are corpses all over town. They're just lying in the street.

80
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,640
I have a question for you.

81
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,440
How many guns did you give out around here?

82
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,880
Huh?

83
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,040
How many townspeople did you give out guns to?

84
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,580
You don't want to make me any angrier.

85
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,220
Now answer me before I break you in half!

86
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,920
All right. He was like our grandson.

87
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,680
Keep talking.

88
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,540
You see, he looked just like our dead grandson.

89
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,760
It was uncanny.

90
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,120
Who did?

91
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,120
I got the impression that he really knew us quite well.

92
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,300
That's how it was. He was just like our real grandson.

93
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,080
Tell me his name.

94
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,760
Earlier, you were writing to your dead grandson's replacement.

95
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,860
You were actually sending him information, isn't that so?

96
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,780
You tell me his name.

97
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,400
He's probably come here for me.

98
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm the one that he's after.

99
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,020
That's true.

100
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,440
I would have to agree, Mr. Poppe.

101
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,640
You mean, Mr. Franz Bonaparta.

102
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,780
[explosion]

103
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:58,960
(thunder rumbling)

104
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,960
- Extremely heavy rain continues to fall

105
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,680
in southern Germany, and there have been fatalities

106
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,080
along the rivers in Bavaria.

107
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:07,840
(Dido coughing)

108
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,880
- You know what?

109
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,900
You smoke way too much.

110
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,100
- It helps with my nerves since I've quit drinking.

111
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,640
- Yeah, I think you should quit smoking too.

112
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,580
- Anyway, show me what you've been drawing

113
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,560
all this time, Dido.

114
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,620
- Does it look like him?

115
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,240
What do you think?

116
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,480
- Look like who?

117
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,240
- Well, it's supposed to be Tenma.

118
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,460
- Not bad.

119
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,780
Maybe I should give your drawing to the police.

120
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,100
Even when I offered information, they didn't believe it.

121
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,400
Not the important parts.

122
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,940
This is the man I'm talking about.

123
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,340
He's out there all by himself,

124
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,400
on a long journey to slay the monster.

125
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,800
- Eva, is he gonna come back?

126
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,740
Now, the latest news on the flood-damaged areas.

127
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,300
Due to the flooding of the Elgar River, many roads are closed and railways have been shut down in several areas.

128
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,400
Power and phone lines have also been affected as well, leading to dangerous conditions in many of the stricken areas.

129
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,020
This is an email that came three days ago.

130
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,240
Its content might be disturbing to you, but Dr. Gillen and I decided you should read it if you feel you're up to it, Nina.

131
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,900
I want to see it.

132
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:34,940
"To Nina, I'll be waiting for you in Ruhenheim, Johan."

133
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,980
So you think it's from him as well.

134
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,480
Earlier, you were describing what you felt Johan was attempting to do right now.

135
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,740
You called it a perfect suicide.

136
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,660
You thought many innocent people might wind up being killed too.

137
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,200
Ruhenheim. There is a village with that name in the south part of Germany.

138
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,760
There's a real possibility that Tenma is headed there as well.

139
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,580
I've got to go there. You have to let me go.

140
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,140
I really must admit this has been an unusual turn of events for me.

141
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,280
At first you were someone who only existed in a certain man's delusions.

142
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,960
It's true. It's as if you were an imaginary character straight out of one of your many story books.

143
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,920
For many years, I carried out my investigation, compiling only objective data.

144
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:35,360
But lately, I did something different. I ignored my methods and looked into that man's delusions.

145
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,600
I tugged at the loose ends of this case, mostly for fun.

146
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,280
In the Czech Republic, I met a young man who had visited the Red Rose Mansion frequently.

147
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,700
That young man was your own son.

148
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,500
This is a hand-drawn postcard he received.

149
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,680
It signed "KP" for Klaus Poppe, your real name.

150
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,240
Even though I've come to this place and you're sitting there right before my eyes,

151
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,460
it still feels unreal to me.

152
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,580
It really is as if a character from one of your picture books sprang to life.

153
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,240
But this is reality.

154
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,780
I did some research and found a list of refugees who had defected from Czechoslovakia

155
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,360
The name Klaus Poppe was listed there.

156
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,680
You escaped and resettled in this town after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

157
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,940
What were you trying to escape from?

158
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,120
Maybe from people like myself?

159
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,480
The orphanage known as 511 Kinderheim only existed because it was part of your plan.

160
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,540
That's where you created subjects like me.

161
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,380
When you ran away, it was to escape the reality you made.

162
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,960
I know what he's up to.

163
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,040
And now, Johan's warped plans are being manifested even as we speak.

164
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,580
And this quiet town is paying in blood for your sins.

165
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,380
Another gunshot?

166
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,420
What's happening? I saw a lot of dead people on the way over here.

167
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,960
Hey, do you have any idea what's going on?

168
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,820
Come on, why are we waiting?

169
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,300
Let's get out of town now.

170
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,360
We can't.

171
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,420
All transportation in and out of here has been shut down.

172
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,220
Well, that's great.

173
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,660
Where do you keep going?

174
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,140
You go out and then every time you come back to our room,

175
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,340
you take another shower.

176
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,540
This whole town smells of gunpowder, blood, and death.

177
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,980
It's disgusting.

178
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,060
You need to calm down, honey.

179
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,460
I've ordered you a pot of tea from the front desk, and that ought to help.

180
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,180
It's all right, baby. There's nothing to be afraid of.

181
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,280
By the time it stops raining, everything will disappear.

182
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,360
Disappear? What do you mean?

183
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,040
All those awful memories.

184
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,020
I'll allow you to go to Ruhenheim if you meet two conditions.

185
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,860
You must allow Dr. Gillen to accompany you.

186
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,680
Number two, he will not be allowed to bring a gun with you.

187
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,940
I won't. I don't need it.

188
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,480
If you'll excuse me, I need to get ready to go.

189
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,940
Dr. Reichwein, I'll need you to do what we talked about.

190
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,340
You, yourself, and Dieter, Eva, and Karl,

191
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,580
Mr. Schuwalt, and Lota,

192
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,020
Everyone that knows Johan must go into hiding.

193
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,420
Johan's trying to erase every last memory of himself.

194
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,980
That's long enough. Come on or Dieter will see you.

195
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:17,180
"My memories with Dieter, and with you, and with Lota and Karl, my memories with the Fortners and with Tenma. I have many memories I don't ever want to forget, even if there are many memories I do want to forget."

196
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,180
But with Johan, it's vital that Johan's memories...

197
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,720
...should not be erased.

198
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,900
A policeman.

199
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,220
And his gun's been taken.

200
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,880
Don't take another step!

201
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,060
Save the town. I beg of you.

202
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,720
Tell me, who shot you?

203
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,200
There have been gunfights everywhere.

204
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,820
At first, these men with guns quietly snuck their way into town and spread themselves around.

205
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,960
Before I or anyone realized what was going on, our own town people had guns and they began shooting each other.

206
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:31,740
I've got to call for help! Help me! I've got to find a way to save... to save the children!

207
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,340
Help!

208
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,620
(dramatic music)

209
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,260
- Johan, I remember clearly the first time

210
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,300
that I heard that name.

211
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,420
It was back in 1995,

212
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,680
in the statement of a certain neurosurgeon.

213
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,120
- Dr. Tenma.

214
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,580
You admit that your theory about this case

215
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,400
is incorrect now, don't you, Inspector?

216
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,220
- No.

217
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,240
You see, Dr. Tenma is still a very important witness to me,

218
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,820
and this Johan is still nothing but a fabrication.

219
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,900
A fabrication.

220
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,720
I found myself obsessed by that term throughout my so-called vacation.

221
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,060
What does a person that exists have to do to become a fabrication?

222
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,120
The answer is quite simple.

223
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,920
Erase all who knew him.

224
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,560
Erase everybody that knows his past.

225
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,140
Everything must disappear.

226
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,000
Isn't that right, Bonaparta, exactly like the ending in your picture book?

227
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,880
At last he had found a name, but there was no longer anyone around to call him by it.

228
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,400
Such a shame, because Johan was such a wonderful name.

229
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,420
That could explain what's happening right now in this town.

230
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,180
That's what I would do if I were in Johan's shoes, because I'm a fabrication as well.

231
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:08,220
I'm not really Neumeyer, the man whose name's written in the hotel's ledger, and I'm not really Wolfgang Grimmer either.

232
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,140
Actually, I'm nothing, a nobody.

233
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:19,660
I imagine I'll disappear someday, with the person who's taken my childhood memories and my real name.

234
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:28,860
I've been waiting for this. I've been waiting here, waiting all this time for my verdict.

235
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,540
"I am not afraid of death, yet I don't know how to atone for my deeds.

236
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,800
I willingly accept whatever happens to me now."

237
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,760
"You've been waiting for this?

238
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
You say you're not afraid to die?

239
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,600
Do you have any idea how terrible the things you did really were?

240
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,440
Do you understand what it means to destroy a human being's sense of good and evil?

241
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:05,400
comprehend what happens when you awaken the monster inside each of us people should know

242
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,900
in their hearts that food tastes good they should always look forward to having picnics

243
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,740
in wonderful places on their weekends they should think that beer tastes good after a

244
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:23,160
hard day's work people should know they should feel they're supposed to grieve from the bottom

245
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,220
from of their hearts if they have to bury their own child.

246
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,760
I won't let you die.

247
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,560
My only goal is to get you out of here safely

248
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,880
and have you go public with everything you've done.

249
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,920
I will see you reveal to the world the identity of the monster

250
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,300
that you awakened with your horrible deeds.

251
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,920
Until that day, I will protect you with my life.

252
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,360
(eerie music)

253
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,420
- Where is Johan now?

254
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,660
- I, I don't know.

255
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,720
- All of us know that there is a monster

256
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,260
orchestrating this massacre.

257
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,160
Now where is he?

258
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,240
- I just don't know.

259
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,220
- Don't lie to me.

260
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,860
- Another gunshot.

261
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,720
Is someone here?

262
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,040
Can you see me?

263
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,260
Look, I'm not holding a gun.

264
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,380
It's all right.

265
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,980
Don't be afraid.

266
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,620
I've come to get you all out of here. You can trust me.

267
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,960
It's too dangerous here. You must escape, or none of you will survive.

268
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:03,100
Stop crying. I'll lead you to the path so you can escape through the woods. Let's get moving.

269
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,200
Wait! I know there's this man who's giving orders from the Hotel Bergbach.

270
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
I see.

271
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,580
That means I'll need more firepower than just my pistol.

272
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,520
I found these two outside.

273
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,660
This is our fault.

274
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,280
I feel like all of this happened because I won the lottery.

275
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,740
We should have informed the police earlier, when we first found Conrad dead.

276
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,700
Back before the town completely lost its mind.

277
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,840
So then you bought all three of these guns.

278
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,280
I haven't fired a single shot with them, honestly!

279
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,980
Let me borrow these two.

280
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,240
You stay here and protect this hotel.

281
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,160
What about you?

282
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,040
Every person you'll see out there is carrying a gun.

283
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,620
I can tell who's trouble.

284
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,960
I'm a detective.

285
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,400
Oh.

286
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,160
By the way, Grimmer.

287
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,260
When we're done with all this, I would like to buy you a beer.

288
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,040
Fine by me.

289
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,460
Run! Get out of here! You have to survive!

290
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,780
[MUSIC]

291
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,760
[MUSIC]

292
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
(gentle music)
