1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Well, well, you certainly have found an excellent piece of property.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,040
It's only a 20-minute drive to the center of Berlin, perfectly situated in a convenient

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,000
and lovely neighborhood.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,780
It's rare to find a unique property of such caliber, especially on the east side.

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,620
I can only imagine.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,700
If I'm not mistaken, wasn't this the residence of Mr. Liebert, the former head of commerce

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,700
of East Germany?

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,700
Eh?

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,700
What?

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,960
You're not a buyer. You just came to investigate Mr. Liebert. Is that all?

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,660
Please forgive me, but I just need some information.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,080
I don't know anything about an official who died almost ten years ago.

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,160
Apparently, Mr. Liebert and his wife adopted fraternal twins during the time that they were here.

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,980
I told you I don't know anything.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,980
Well, who owns the property? Can you direct me to them?

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,300
Listen, a lot of the property in former East Germany

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,720
used to be owned by Jews who had to flee during the Nazi regime.

18
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,260
In some cases, the government ended up borrowing land

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,800
from people on the West Side or in other countries.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,360
The owner of this property is overseas.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,660
Besides, my company is a West Side real estate firm

22
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,060
that entered the Eastern Market after the wall fell.

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,000
We don't know anything about the past.

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,860
Now, if you could please hurry and leave, I'm locking up.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,140
Isn't there anyone who might remember?

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,140
Could there possibly be someone who knew the Lieberts?

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,680
Like I already told you, this was a residential area where many high-ranking officials lived.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,540
Most of them fled soon after the wall came down.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,400
Especially the officials from the Ministry of the Interior.

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,680
Come to think of it, an ex-official from the East German Department of Commerce lives about ten houses away.

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,360
Yeah, I remember Mr. Liebert.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,800
I'll never understand why he decided to take such a risk,

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,540
if only he'd waited just a little longer until East Germany collapsed.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,700
It makes you wonder why he went to a free country only to be killed in the end.

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,560
It's a damn shame, really.

36
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,040
Do you remember if Mr. Liebert had children? Twins, perhaps?

37
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,720
Did he have twins, you say? Hmm.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,900
Oh, yes, that's right.

39
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,140
Mr. Liebert adopted those twins from the orphanage.

40
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,080
Are you sure?

41
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,940
That's right. Those two were such cute kids.

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,120
Mr. Liebert always did talk about wanting children.

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,400
Which orphanage was it?

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Which one was it?

45
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,980
Hmm. 511?

46
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,440
Yes, that's right. I believe they came from 511 Kinderheim.

47
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,200
I'm sorry. 511 Kinderheim?

They're planning on turning this old orphanage into a supermarket sometime soon.

59
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,980
About time. Thank goodness they're finally going to destroy this creepy building.

60
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:40,520
Excuse me, ma'am. By any chance, do you know anyone from this place?

61
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,120
The orphanage? Everyone from there is long since gone.

62
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,260
I really prefer not to talk about it. It was such a tragedy.

63
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,380
But I...

64
00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:01,600
If you want to find out more about it, there's a former official from the old Ministry of Welfare named Hartmann over on 47th Street.

65
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:24,200
Hello there. Do you know if a man named Hartmann lives around here?

66
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,220
Wait, what's wrong? You're injured? Let me take a look.

67
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you.

68
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,000
You re-injured an old wound.

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,720
It's infected, but this should help.

70
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,700
Attaboy.

71
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,140
I know this stings, but it'll help you get better.

72
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,920
There you go. All done.

73
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,840
Be careful, okay?

74
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,540
You might get hurt again.

75
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,820
Hartmann.

76
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:35,860
after the fall of east germany i became the foster parent to all those kids you see photographed up

77
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,480
on the wall foster parent yes well it just means that i took care of them until they were adopted

78
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,500
or eventually able to go off on their own the boy in the middle was adopted by the president

79
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:54,920
of an accessories company and the last one on the left is enlisted in the army i still have one left

80
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,280
in my care right now it must be hard work for you to tell the truth i wouldn't call it work

81
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,520
as the district official for the ministry of welfare i worked for many years dealing

82
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,320
with orphans and i was adamantly against the way the government handled them

83
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:18,820
after the fall of socialism i thought i'd try doing things my own way i couldn't do any worse

84
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:25,140
of course it isn't easy and i don't have many resources but it's far better than the way they

85
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,100
were living in that orphanage, if you can call it that.

86
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,980
The Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Welfare

87
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,980
ran 511 Kinderheim as a special orphanage.

88
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,560
Well, all East German orphanages were pretty severe places

89
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,400
to be.

90
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,440
But these special orphanages were particularly notorious.

91
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,560
It wasn't just an institution for children

92
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,820
with nowhere to go.

93
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,980
It was the place where children of criminals

94
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,520
and political prisoners or suspected dissidents were sent.

95
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,980
Discrimination and inhumane cruelty

96
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,120
were part of everyday life for the children there.

97
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,400
Those poor unfortunates were defenseless

98
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,100
and couldn't do anything about their situation.

99
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,560
Ironically, it was a contradictory clash

100
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,560
between socialism and totalitarianism.

101
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,000
The government claimed they were reeducating them

102
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,580
to be good citizens, but in actuality,

103
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,340
behind closed doors and away from the public eye,

104
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,220
Those helpless children were treated like criminals,

105
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,080
even worse than criminals.

106
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,940
The director and instructors were absolutely terrible.

107
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,800
The worst of the bunch would confiscate care packages

108
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,760
sent to the children and sell them for their own profit.

109
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,940
Who then were the real criminals, I ask you?

110
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,100
Fear and violence ruled the daily lives

111
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,100
of those poor children in those special orphanages.

112
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,780
You can't raise normal people that way.

113
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:55,340
and then one day that incident happened the incident what exactly do you mean by

114
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,780
that well when you came here you said that you wanted to ask me about the

115
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,980
twins didn't you yes that's right can you tell me anything at all about them I

116
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,060
don't know much about the girl except that she was left at an orphanage in a

117
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,960
different district but the boy I'll always remember the brother Johan Johan

118
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,560
Yes, please, tell me whatever there is to know.

119
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,160
What happened?

120
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,960
They kept everyone from finding out.

121
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,700
The East German government placed a strict gag order on it.

122
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,360
Well, it is in the past now, so I suppose it's all right.

123
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,440
I guess there's no harm in talking to you about the incident.

124
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,160
Sir, what are you talking about?

125
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,040
I need to know.

126
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,000
What'd Johan do?

127
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,700
He led an uprising.

128
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,640
I'm home.

129
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,700
Dieter, we have company.

130
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,900
Come here and say hello to him, why don't you?

131
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,440
Oh.

132
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,540
Dieter, where are your manners?

133
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,280
Well, are you going to greet the man or not?

134
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,260
Oh, it's okay.

135
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,720
We already met earlier out in front of the building.

136
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,880
Remember?

137
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,760
Please, continue, Mr. Hartmann

138
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,240
I'd like to hear more

139
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
No, I'm sorry, I can't

140
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,600
Not in front of the child

141
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,700
Uh, understood

142
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,840
Well, it's late

143
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,420
Can we continue this another time?

144
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,560
Dieter

145
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,380
Maybe you'd like to stay and have dinner with us

146
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,240
Sure, if you don't mind

147
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,360
Mr. Tenma, you say that you're a freelance journalist.

148
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,940
Does that mean you're going to write an article about the things we've been talking about?

149
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,920
Eventually.

150
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,180
When you do write your article, please be sure to emphasize this.

151
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,180
The moral development of a child all depends on the adult that raises him.

152
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,920
It is essential that we encourage every child to follow the proper path.

153
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,980
If we do, they'll be able to achieve their dreams and have a happy life.

154
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,260
Dreams, huh?

155
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,940
Hey, Dieter, what are your dreams?

156
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,500
A soccer ball.

157
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,460
Huh?

158
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,920
I want a soccer ball.

159
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,680
I see.

160
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,860
Thank you for dinner.

161
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,420
I was hoping we could continue our conversation another time.

162
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,360
Of course. I am sorry we couldn't finish it up tonight, Mr. Tenma.

163
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,100
I'll be back. Perhaps I can come by tomorrow.

164
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,760
Well, Dieter.

165
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:27,780
Hey.

166
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,540
Uh, hello. I'm sorry.

167
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,200
May I still make a purchase?

168
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:43,320
Mr. Hartmann?

169
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,820
It's me, Tenma.

170
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,660
Mr. Hartmann?

171
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,720
Mr. Hartmann!

172
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,680
Mr. Hartmann, what's wrong?

173
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,940
Please, open up!

174
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,620
Mr. Hartmann, I...

175
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,300
Mr. Tenma?

176
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,040
Dieter!

177
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,600
What happened to him?

178
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,040
He was playing. He was standing on a chair and he fell.

179
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,640
Oh, my dear Dieter.

180
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,540
It hurts. Oh, it really hurts.

181
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
Where, Dieter? Where does it hurt?

182
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,560
It hurts everywhere.

183
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,240
Mr. Hartmann, call an ambulance, quick.

184
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,280
All right.

185
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,100
Dieter, let me take a look.

186
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
My God.

187
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,800
What are all these bruises?

188
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,340
Does this hurt?

189
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,060
What about here?

190
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,440
Two of your ribs are fractured, and also your shoulder is dislocated.

191
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,140
How did you get this injury from falling off a chair?

192
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,720
The ambulance is on the way and should be here soon, so everything's going to be all right.

193
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,000
Good, but where'd these bruises come from?

194
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,200
I said everything's all right. You can leave now, Mr. Tenma.

195
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,200
But...

196
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,280
Your hand's just now. It was like you were examining him. It's as if you were a doctor.

197
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Uh, well...

198
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,380
Tenma, I thought I heard that name somewhere before.

199
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,920
You are a doctor, aren't you?

200
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,380
The one wanted for murder.

201
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,540
These bruises. Just how did he get these bruises all over his body, huh?

202
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,220
You shouldn't worry about the boy. You've got your own problems, don't you?

203
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,100
The police are on their way, along with the ambulance.

204
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Mr. Hartmann, what really happened to Dieter? How did he get all of these injuries?

205
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,100
What's it matter to you? I mean, you're the one who's wanted for murder, Doctor.

206
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,100
You're very short-tempered. Just like a fugitive.

207
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
You did this to him, didn't you?

208
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Did what? What do you mean?

209
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,100
You're the one who's been abusing Dieter all this time, aren't you?

210
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:00,340
aren't you? Abusing? Why, I'd never do such a thing to an innocent child. Right, Dieter?

211
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,420
Wait, what are you doing? I'm taking Dieter to the hospital.

212
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:16,420
First murder and now kidnapping too? Don't move. The police will catch you eventually.

213
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:24,640
It's okay, Dieter

214
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,340
We'll be at the hospital soon

215
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,680
I'm scared

216
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,660
I'm scared of the hospital

217
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,200
There's nothing to be afraid of

218
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,320
The doctors will take good care of you

219
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,080
But Mr. Harmon is always the one who took care of me

220
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,800
Every time I got hurt before

221
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,200
What?

222
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,380
What are you telling me?

223
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,200
You're completely covered in scars and bruises

224
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,600
And you've never been to a hospital?

225
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,460
I'm scared

226
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,100
The world is full of bad things

227
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,000
That's why I have to become stronger

228
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,680
If I'm gonna fight all the bad things

229
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
I have to become stronger

230
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,540
Is that what Hartmann told you?

231
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,580
The world is dark

232
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,860
The future is bleak

233
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,940
That isn't true

234
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,120
The world's not a dark place. That's a lie.

235
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,780
Really?

236
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,520
Yes, really.

237
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,360
Oh, I almost forgot.

238
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,060
This soccer ball is for you.

239
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:24,980
Wow!

240
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,640
Tomorrow will be a good day.

241
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,060
I promise.

242
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,080
I'm sorry for coming so late.

243
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,140
Thank you, nurse.

244
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,360
It's all right, but the ER is pretty busy at the moment.

245
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,120
It might end up being a while before we can treat him.

246
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,800
Can't you move him up at all?

247
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,460
There was a very big accident. I'm sorry.

248
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,040
The bus driver died instantly, so we need to ask the truck driver about the circumstances of the accident.

249
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,640
He broke both his legs, but he can still talk, can't he?

250
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,420
We have to treat him first. You can question him after we're done.

251
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,920
All right, then we'll wait right here until he's ready.

252
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,220
Uh, I see. I'll be back in two hours.

253
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:06,960
What?

254
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,740
Please, just do what you can to take care of the boy.

255
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,480
And whatever you do, please be sure not to let anyone else take him away.

256
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,340
I will be coming back to get him.

257
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,580
I owe you one.

258
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,200
But, sir...

259
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,160
Is the accident site cleaned up yet?

260
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,120
No, traffic's still backed up.

261
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,800
Okay, what should I do now?

262
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,320
First, what to do with Dieter?

263
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,940
Even if I call the police, I can't go with him.

264
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:44,380
I don't know much about the girl, except that she was left at an orphanage in a different district.

265
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,060
A different orphanage?

266
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,440
Wait, that's it?

267
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,940
There's a child that you want me to take in?

268
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Well, are you the child's parent?

269
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,340
What are you doing coming here at this hour?

270
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,340
I'm sorry. I know it's a strange request, but this child needs you.

271
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,660
Look, I understand that the child is being abused.

272
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,580
But if I don't know who you are, then how can I...

273
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,440
Well, I... I just...

274
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,940
I can't take in a child from a suspicious person who won't even identify himself.

275
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,900
Wait! Did Anna Liebert live here with you at this orphanage by any chance?

276
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,280
Hold on a second.

277
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,580
Are you saying that you know Anna Liebert?

278
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,880
That's right. So you do remember Anna?

279
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,200
Yes, of course I do.

280
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,680
How is Anna? Is she doing well for herself?

281
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,480
Uh, yes. She's currently taking classes at Heidelberg University.

282
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,660
Really? Then I guess she's doing very well.

283
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,640
Anna was such a nice girl.

284
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,500
I heard she was adopted by Mr. Liebert of the Commerce Ministry.

285
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,780
Along with her twin brother... Oh, dear.

286
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,680
What was his name again?

287
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,440
Johan.

288
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,760
That was it. His name was Johan.

289
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,300
They were truly very close.

290
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,700
I felt so sorry for them when they had to be separated,

291
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,060
but they had to be placed in different orphanages.

292
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,260
Before the two of them arrived here, they only had each other.

293
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,440
They were truly alone in this world.

294
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,220
They were found walking hand in hand near the border of Czechoslovakia.

295
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,600
Just the two of them, shivering all alone in the cold.

296
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,160
At first, Mr. Liebert was only going to adopt Johan,

297
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,900
but Johan wouldn't go anywhere without his sister.

298
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,420
There was no separating them.

299
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,480
Thankfully, Anna was able to live a happy life because of her brother.

300
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,480
I heard that the conditions in the orphanages in East Germany were pretty terrible.

301
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,900
Not all orphanages were like 511 Kinderheim.

302
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:06,720
Inga, dear, the bathroom is the other way.

303
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,400
Down the hall, okay?

304
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,940
Mommy!

305
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,360
It's all right, it's all right.

306
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,260
There's nothing to be afraid of.

307
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,440
Now you can go to the bathroom by yourself, can't you?

308
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:31,720
These poor children have never really felt the love of a parent.

309
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,880
In order to develop as a person, the only thing you need is love.

310
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,140
The orphanages of the East Side were truly horrible places for the children to grow up in.

311
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,000
Everything was so impersonal. Even this place was only known by the number 47.

312
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,340
You'd better believe we did everything we could do within our power.

313
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,740
so that we wouldn't be controlled by the government.

314
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,320
We weren't going to be another 511 Kinderheim.

315
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,660
It was a special orphanage controlled by the Ministry of Welfare

316
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,000
and the Ministry of the Interior.

317
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,780
Do you know what that means?

318
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,240
Uh, no.

319
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,660
The reality was,

320
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,040
it was the Ministry of the Interior's pet project.

321
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,460
East Germany was using that place for experimentation

322
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,300
on the children.

323
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:50,420
We'll be right back.
