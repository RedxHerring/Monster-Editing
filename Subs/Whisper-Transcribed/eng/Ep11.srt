1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,700
Well, well, you certainly have found an excellent piece of property.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,140
It's only a 20-minute drive to the center of Berlin, perfectly situated in a convenient and lovely neighborhood.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,500
It's rare to find a unique property of such caliber, especially on the east side.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:27,440
I can only imagine. If I'm not mistaken, wasn't this the residence of Mr. Liebert, the former head of commerce of East Germany?

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,960
What? You're not a buyer. You just came to investigate Mr. Liebert. Is that all?

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,680
Please forgive me, but I just need some information.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,060
I don't know anything about an official who died almost ten years ago.

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,160
Apparently, Mr. Liebert and his wife adopted fraternal twins during the time that they were here.

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,980
I told you, I don't know anything.

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,980
Well, who owns the property? Can you direct me to them?

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,720
A lot of the property in former East Germany used to be owned by Jews who had to flee during the Nazi regime.

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,880
In some cases, the government ended up borrowing land from people on the West Side or in other countries.

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,340
The owner of this property is overseas.

14
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,040
Besides, my company is a West Side real estate firm that entered the Eastern Market after the Wall fell.

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,980
We don't know anything about the past.

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,860
Now, if you could please hurry and leave, I'm locking up.

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,140
Isn't there anyone who might remember?

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,140
Could there possibly be someone who knew the Lieberts?

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,680
Like I already told you, this was a residential area where many high-ranking officials lived.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,520
Most of them fled soon after the wall came down.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,380
Especially the official from the Ministry of the Interior.

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,680
Come to think of it, an ex-official from the East German Department of Commerce lives about ten houses away.

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,360
Yeah, I remember Mr. Liebert.

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:59,580
I'll never understand why he decided to take such a risk if only he'd waited just a little longer until East Germany collapsed

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,180
It makes you wonder why he went to a free country only to be killed in the end. It's a damn shame

26
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:15,740
Really? Do you remember if mr. Liebert had children twins perhaps? Did he have twins you say hmm? Oh

27
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,900
Yes, that's right

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,260
Mr. Liebert adopted those twins from the orphanage. Are you sure that's right

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,940
Those two were such cute kids.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,140
Mr. Liebert always did talk about wanting children.

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,400
- Which orphanage was it?

32
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,780
- Which one was it?

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,100
Hmm.

34
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:33,980
511?

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,440
Yes, that's right.

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,420
I believe they came from 511 Kinderheim.

37
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,860
- I'm sorry.

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,160
511 Kinderheim?

39
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,820
(dramatic music)

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:00,860
(suspenseful music)

41
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,600
[MUSIC]

42
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,160
(dramatic music)

43
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,700
(birds squawking)

44
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,960
They're planning on turning this old orphanage into a supermarket sometime soon.

45
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,540
About time.

46
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,900
Thank goodness they're finally going to destroy this creepy building.

47
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,260
Excuse me, ma'am.

48
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,520
By any chance, do you know anyone from this place?

49
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,060
The orphanage?

50
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,120
Everyone from there is long since gone.

51
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,300
Remember not to talk about it. It was such a tragedy.

52
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,380
Uh, but I...

53
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,500
If you want to find out more about it,

54
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,620
there's a former official from the old Ministry of Welfare named Hartmann over on 47th Street.

55
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,200
Hello there. Do you know if a man named Hartmann lives around here?

56
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,200
Wait, what's wrong? You're injured? Let me take a look.

57
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,980
Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you.

58
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,720
You re-injured an old wound. It's infected, but this should help.

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,140
Atta boy. I know this stings, but it'll help you get better.

60
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,040
There you go, all done.

61
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,860
Be careful, okay?

62
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,920
You might get hurt again.

63
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,780
Hartmann.

64
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
After the fall of East Germany,

65
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,540
I became the foster parent to all those kids you see photographed up on the wall.

66
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,700
Foster parent?

67
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Yes, well, it just means that I took care of them until they were adopted or eventually able to go off on their own.

68
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,900
The boy in the middle was adopted by the president of an accessories company,

69
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,260
and the last one on the left is enlisted in the army.

70
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,100
I still have one left in my care right now.

71
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,800
It must be hard work for you.

72
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,260
To tell the truth, I wouldn't call it work.

73
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,680
As the district official for the Ministry of Welfare,

74
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,120
I worked for many years dealing with orphans,

75
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,220
and I was adamantly against the way the government handled them.

76
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,160
After the fall of socialism, I thought I'd try doing things my own way.

77
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,800
I couldn't do any worse.

78
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,740
Of course, it isn't easy, and I don't have many resources,

79
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,440
but it's far better than the way they were living in that orphanage,

80
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,760
if you can call it that.

81
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:35,460
The Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Welfare ran 511 Kinderheim as a special orphanage.

82
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,940
Well, all these German orphanages were pretty severe places to be.

83
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,760
But these special orphanages were particularly notorious.

84
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,460
It wasn't just an institution for children with nowhere to go.

85
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,180
It was the place where children of criminals and political prisoners or suspected dissidents were sent.

86
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,740
humane cruelty were part of everyday life for the children there. Those poor

87
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,760
unfortunates were defenseless and couldn't do anything about their

88
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,560
situation. Ironically, it was a contradictory clash between socialism

89
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,100
and totalitarianism. The government claimed they were re-educating them to

90
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,800
be good citizens, but in actuality, behind closed doors and away from the public

91
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,980
eye, those helpless children were treated like criminals, even worse than

92
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,900
and instructors were absolutely terrible.

93
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,640
The worst of the bunch would confiscate care packages

94
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,320
sent to the children and sell them for their own profit.

95
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,140
Who then were the real criminals, I ask you?

96
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,020
Fear and violence ruled the daily lives

97
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,460
of those poor children in those special orphanages.

98
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,420
You can't raise normal people that way.

99
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,760
And then one day, that incident happened.

100
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,720
- Incident?

101
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,820
What exactly do you mean by that?

102
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,840
You said that you wanted to ask me about the twins, didn't you?

103
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,780
Yes, that's right. Can you tell me anything at all about them?

104
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,920
I don't know much about the girl, except that she was left at an orphanage in a different district.

105
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,000
But the boy... I'll always remember the brother, Johan.

106
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Johan? Yes, please, tell me whatever there is to know!

107
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,960
What happened? They kept everyone from finding out?

108
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,720
The East German government placed a strict gag order on it.

109
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,360
Well, it is in the past now, so I suppose it's all right.

110
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,420
I guess there's no harm in talking to you about the incident.

111
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,140
Sir, what are you talking about?

112
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,060
I need to know.

113
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,000
What'd Johan do?

114
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,700
He led an uprising.

115
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,620
I'm home.

116
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,920
Dieter, we have company. Come here and say hello to him, why don't you?

117
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,420
Oh.

118
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,280
Dieter, where are your manners? Well, are you going to greet the man or not?

119
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,780
Oh, it's okay. We already met earlier out in front of the building. Remember?

120
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,220
Please, continue, Mr. Hartmann. I'd like to hear more.

121
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,580
No, I'm sorry, I can't. Not in front of the child.

122
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,660
Uh, understood.

123
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,360
Well, it's late. Can we continue this another time?

124
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,540
Dieter.

125
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,340
Maybe you'd like to stay and have dinner with us?

126
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,220
Sure, if you don't mind.

127
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,340
"Mr. Tenma, you say that you're a freelance journalist.

128
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,440
Does that mean you're going to write an article about the things we've been talking about?"

129
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,460
"Eventually."

130
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,160
"When you do write your article, please be sure to emphasize this.

131
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,180
The moral development of a child all depends on the adult that raises him.

132
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,920
It is essential that we encourage every child to follow the proper path.

133
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,980
If we do, they'll be able to achieve their dreams and have a happy life.

134
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,260
Dreams, huh?

135
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,940
Hey Dieter, what are your dreams?

136
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,520
A soccer ball.

137
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,460
Huh?

138
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,900
I want a soccer ball.

139
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,680
I see.

140
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,880
Thank you for dinner.

141
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,480
I was hoping we could continue our conversation another time.

142
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,400
Of course. I am sorry we couldn't finish it up tonight, Mr. Tenma.

143
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,100
I'll be back. Perhaps I can come by tomorrow.

144
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,520
Well, Dieter...

145
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,580
(eerie music)

146
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,820
- Hey.

147
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,520
Hello, I'm sorry.

148
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,300
May I still make a purchase?

149
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,820
Mr. Hartman? It's me, Tenma.

150
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,660
Mr. Hartman?

151
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,920
Mr. Hartman! Mr. Hartman, what's wrong? Please, open up!

152
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,780
Mr. Hartman, I...

153
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,300
Mr. Tenma!

154
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,600
Dieter! What happened to him?

155
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,960
He was playing. He was standing on a chair and he fell.

156
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,660
Oh, my dear Dieter.

157
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,540
It hurts. Oh, it really hurts.

158
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,020
Where, Dieter? Where does it hurt?

159
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,580
It hurts everywhere.

160
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,180
Mr. Hartmann, call an ambulance, quick!

161
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,260
All right.

162
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,080
Dieter, let me take a look.

163
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,260
Look! My God!

164
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,800
What are all these bruises?

165
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,340
Does this hurt?

166
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,080
What about here?

167
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,600
Two of your ribs are fractured.

168
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,440
And also, your shoulder is dislocated.

169
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,140
How did you get this injury from falling off a chair?

170
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,760
The ambulance is on the way and should be here soon,

171
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,720
so everything's going to be all right.

172
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,980
Good. But where'd these bruises come from?

173
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,200
Everything's alright. You can leave now, Mr. Tenma.

174
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,240
But...

175
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,520
Your hands just now, it was like you were examining him.

176
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,300
It's as if you were a doctor.

177
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,640
Uh, well...

178
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,360
Tenma, I thought I heard that name somewhere before.

179
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,920
You are a doctor, aren't you?

180
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,400
The one wanted for murder.

181
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,680
These bruises...

182
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,540
Just how did he get these bruises all over his body, huh?

183
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,620
You shouldn't worry about the boy.

184
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,240
You've got your own problems, don't you?

185
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,200
The police are on their way, along with the ambulance.

186
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,720
Mr. Hartman, what really happened to Dieter?

187
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,540
How did he get all of these injuries?

188
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,800
What's it matter to you?

189
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,560
I mean, you're the one who's wanted for murder, Doctor.

190
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,640
You're very short-tempered.

191
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,660
Just like a fugitive.

192
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,580
You did this to him, didn't you?

193
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,340
What do you mean?

194
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,660
You're the one who's been abusing Dieter all this time, aren't you?

195
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,820
Abusing? Why, I'd never do such a thing to an innocent child.

196
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,360
Right, Dieter?

197
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,340
Wait, what are you doing?

198
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,380
I'm taking Dieter to the hospital.

199
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,900
First murder, and now kidnapping, too?

200
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,080
Don't move!

201
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,220
The police will catch you, eventually.

202
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,320
It's okay, Dieter. We'll be at the hospital soon.

203
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,660
I'm scared. I'm scared of the hospital.

204
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,180
There's nothing to be afraid of.

205
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,220
The doctors will take good care of you.

206
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,060
But Mr. Harmon is always the one who took care of me

207
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,940
every time I got hurt before.

208
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,200
What?

209
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,360
What are you telling me?

210
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,200
You're completely covered in scars and bruises

211
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,540
and you've never been to a hospital?

212
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,460
I'm scared.

213
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,660
"The world is full of bad things. That's why I have to become stronger."

214
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,740
"If I'm gonna fight all the bad things, I have to become stronger."

215
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,960
"Is that what Heartmon told you?"

216
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,540
"The world is dark. The future is bleak."

217
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,160
"That isn't true."

218
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,920
"The world's not a dark place. That's a lie."

219
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,280
"Really?"

220
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,900
"Yes, really."

221
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:30,120
I almost forgot this soccer ball is for you tomorrow will be a good day I promise

222
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry for coming so late thank you nurse it's all right but the ER is pretty busy at

223
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,880
the moment it might end up being a while before we can treat him can't you move him up at all

224
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,600
There was a very big accident

225
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,600
So we need to ask the truck driver about the circumstances of the accident he broke both his legs, but he can still talk any

226
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,960
We have to treat him first

227
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,280
You can question him after we're done. All right, then we'll wait right here until he's ready. I see

228
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,760
I'll be back in two hours. What please just do what you can to take care of the boy

229
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,180
and

230
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,480
Whatever you do, please be sure not to let anyone else take him away

231
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,580
I will be coming back to get him. I owe you one.

232
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,200
Uh, but sir...

233
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,160
Is the accident site cleaned up yet?

234
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,140
No, traffic's still backed up.

235
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,800
Okay, what should I do now?

236
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,320
First, what to do with Dieter?

237
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,940
Even if I call the police, I can't go with him.

238
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,160
I don't know much about the girl,

239
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,300
except that she was left at an orphanage in a different district.

240
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,440
A different orphanage. Wait, that's it!

241
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,920
There's a child that you want me to take in?

242
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,660
Well, are you the child's parent?

243
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,360
What are you doing coming here at this hour?

244
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,300
I'm sorry, I know it's a strange request, but this child needs you.

245
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,660
Look, I understand that the child is being abused,

246
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,440
If you don't know who you are, then how can I...

247
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Well, I... I just...

248
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,940
I can't take in a child from a suspicious person who won't even identify himself.

249
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,940
Wait! Did Anna Liebert live here with you at this orphanage by any chance?

250
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,280
Hold on a second.

251
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,600
Are you saying that you know Anna Liebert?

252
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,860
That's right. So you do remember Anna?

253
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,180
Yes, of course I do.

254
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,700
How is Anna? Is she doing well for herself?

255
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,520
Yes. She's currently taking classes at Heidelberg University.

256
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,660
Really? Then I guess she's doing very well.

257
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,640
Anna was such a nice girl.

258
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,500
I heard she was adopted by Mr. Liebert of the Commerce Ministry,

259
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,780
along with her twin brother... Oh, dear.

260
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,640
What was his name again?

261
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,440
Johan.

262
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,780
That was it. His name was Johan.

263
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,300
They were truly very close.

264
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,720
I felt so sorry for them when they had to be separated,

265
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,080
but they had to be placed in different orphanages.

266
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,260
Before the two of them arrived here, they only had each other.

267
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
They were truly alone in this world.

268
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,220
They were found walking hand in hand near the border of Czechoslovakia.

269
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,560
Just the two of them, shivering all alone in the cold.

270
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,980
At first, Mr. Liebert was only going to adopt Johann,

271
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,900
but Johann wouldn't go anywhere without his sister.

272
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,420
There was no separating them.

273
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,460
Thankfully, Anna was able to live a happy life because of her brother.

274
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,500
I heard that the conditions in the orphanages in East Germany were pretty terrible.

275
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,900
Not all orphanages were like 5-1-1 Kinderheim.

276
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,700
Inga, dear, the bathroom is the other way.

277
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,420
Down the hall, okay?

278
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,280
It's all right, it's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of.

279
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,460
Now you can go to the bathroom by yourself, can't you?

280
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,680
These poor children have never really felt the love of a parent.

281
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,880
In order to develop as a person, the only thing you need is love.

282
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,160
The orphanages of the East Side were truly horrible places for the children to grow up in.

283
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,000
Everything was so impersonal, even this place was only known by the number 47.

284
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,360
You'd better believe we did everything we could do within our power,

285
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,100
so that we wouldn't be controlled by the government.

286
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,940
We weren't going to be another 5-1-1 Kinderheim.

287
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,260
It was a special orphanage controlled by the Ministry of Welfare and the Ministry of the Interior.

288
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,560
Do you know what that means?

289
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,980
Uh, no.

290
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,460
The reality was, it was the Ministry of the Interior's pet project.

291
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,180
East Germany was using that place for experimentation...

292
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,580
on the children.

293
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,280
(eerie music)

294
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,180
[MUSIC]

295
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,240
