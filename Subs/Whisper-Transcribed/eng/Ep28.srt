1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,920
That's good enough? When you say that, just what exactly do you mean, Mr. Schuvald?

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,620
I've decided that I've learned enough. I am calling off the investigation.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:22,040
But sir, we had a breakthrough, and I'm close to another. I checked out Carl Neumann, and one thing's certain, that boy's your real son.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,740
I'm quite grateful to you for all you've done.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,680
Now, hold on. There's still more to be done.

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,140
There's still the Edmund Farran issue to figure out.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,780
Edmund pretended to be your son, but some evidence I uncovered seems to indicate that he didn't really commit suicide.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,100
If that's really the case, someone else is pulling the strings and may have killed Farran.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,720
It has been solved to my satisfaction.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,520
Father, I made some tea. Would you care for some?

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,600
Yes, I would.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,900
Oh, good afternoon, detective.

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,040
Would you care to join us?

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,740
No, thank you. I'll be going.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,780
Once again, good work. Just send me your bill. Good day.

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,700
It sure looks nice outside.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It does.

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,920
Oh, and Johan's come as well.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,100
What a surprise. So Johan's decided to visit.

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,680
Shuvald had always been known as a distrustful man with a sour disposition.

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,460
Who would have thought that he'd turn into such a good-natured soul when he found his son?

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,300
With that smile of his, who'd have guessed that people still call him the Vampire of Bavaria?

23
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,500
What a surprise. So Johan's decided to visit.

So, you're trying to track down this puppy, eh?

30
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,540
What a job.

31
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,980
My client told me her ex-husband basically dog-napped the little fella.

32
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,480
I guess disputes over pets can be just as bad as ones over kids.

33
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,240
You're right about that.

34
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,640
I think I'll have some wine, if that's quite all right with you.

35
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,380
You go ahead. I'll be sticking with the sparkling water.

36
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,620
I'm glad to hear you say that.

37
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,800
I know work's scarce at the moment, but it's a good choice on your part

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,880
life with alcohol I'm doing okay at least on that account what do you mean

39
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,440
are you saying there's something else in your life that's bothering you well I

40
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,860
find that with all the free time I have now I end up rehashing things a lot such

41
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,980
as I spend hours and hours pouring over this personal notebook I have of

42
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:19,260
unsolved crimes cases I never solved as a detective how interesting so tell me

43
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,140
when you look at it how do you feel I feel frustrated there were so many

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,880
I wasn't able to solve it haunts me to think of those vicious killers still out there walking around in our world

45
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,320
They're free because of my incompetence

46
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,000
Even now I can't seem to catch them. You're being too hard on yourself

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,600
You could have caught them you had the skills to solve those cases

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,860
But your self-critical nature was impeding you Richard you got frustrated that you couldn't read these murderers minds and that caused you pain

49
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,860
So I turned to alcohol

50
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,040
Sure. Of course you did.

51
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,340
Gentlemen, dinner is served.

52
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,240
Oh, good. It's time to eat.

53
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,920
Actually, I think it would be in your best interest for you to keep trying.

54
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,460
Hmm?

55
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,580
I would encourage you to keep looking at your old police notebook.

56
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,480
But why? I'll just become angry again.

57
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,140
Stop thinking that way.

58
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,760
You have to analyze what you did in the past in a new light.

59
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,020
Your mind is clearer now that should help. Let's be frank with each other

60
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,180
We both know that you shot a young serial killer when you were drunk

61
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,380
And I must say you are facing the reality of what happened that night admirably

62
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,680
But now Richard you face a far greater challenge

63
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,660
Facing your thoughts when you pulled that trigger

64
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,900
You're still haunted by that boy you see him in your mind every day, don't you?

65
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,460
When you've brought everything to light, all those things festering under the surface,

66
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,800
that boy's ghost will finally move on.

67
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,240
I see. When I've brought everything to light, huh?

68
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,840
The Homer murder case is a good place to start. The victim, Joachim Homer, had a long and

69
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,860
steady career as an accountant. He was never involved in anything shady and had no enemies.

70
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,900
And when he was murdered, there were no signs of a robbery.

71
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,620
Then there were those two Voice of God cases. The victims were a former housekeeper and

72
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,420
a chauffeur. What connected those two killings was that the words "I have heard the voice

73
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,040
of God" were left scrawled on a wall at both crime scenes.

74
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,740
The Dornach Company President case.

75
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,260
Lothar Gauck was one of the wealthiest businessmen in Bavaria, and his body was discovered in the Hartoltz Forest.

76
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,280
And then there's the Spira couple case.

77
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,760
Both were forcibly drowned, and their bodies washed up along the Isar River later on.

78
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,540
This one's still being investigated as one of a string of murders involving middle-aged couples.

79
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,940
A material witness in that case disappeared, a Japanese doctor who's still on the run.

80
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,160
Oh, man.

81
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,880
The more unsolved cases I had, the more booze I drank.

82
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,460
Then it felt good, but it's different now.

83
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,980
This is tough. It feels just like the doctor said.

84
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,480
So I'm sober, my mind is clear and I'm feeling calm.

85
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,580
Hey.

86
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,660
Hold on a second. Come on. Think think hard Richard

87
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,340
(panting)

88
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,080
- So, you tried doing it again and what was the result?

89
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,180
- I did.

90
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,460
I looked at all my notes and I thought of something new,

91
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,600
but then I...

92
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,640
- You saw that boy's ghost again,

93
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,580
and once that happened,

94
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,180
you lost your train of thought, right?

95
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,200
- Uh-huh.

96
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,700
- There's no need to worry.

97
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,960
When you have an important thought like that,

98
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,860
sooner or later it will come back to you.

99
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,460
What was it that I realized?

100
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,860
An idea flashed through my mind.

101
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,880
It felt like it was a key to solving one of those cases.

102
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,960
Just my imagination.

103
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,240
Who's there?

104
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,420
Show yourself!

105
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,440
Whoever you are, I'll catch you!

106
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,440
This is like that time, way back.

107
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,440
I was running after that punk just like this.

108
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,200
I chased him down an alley.

109
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,300
Sorry for coming here so late at night, Doc.

110
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,980
Nonsense. If you think you've figured things out and you're ready to share them, go ahead then. Tell me everything.

111
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,340
Back then, I felt myself looking deep within that killer.

112
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,380
That's when I knew it existed in this world.

113
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,740
It was true evil.

114
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,500
And once I saw it standing right there in front of me, I shot and killed him.

115
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,080
That's good. Thank you for sharing, Richard.

116
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,140
By telling me this, you're well on the road to recovery.

117
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,840
There's still more, Doctor. It just came to me.

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,220
Hmm?

119
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,860
That idea that had flashed through my mind before.

120
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,980
All those unsolved cases I had been working to solve separately.

121
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,160
I realized they are actually one single case.

122
00:10:59,560 --> 00:10:59,840
Huh?

123
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,040
Greetings, my dear Dr. Gillan. I'm writing to thank you for sending me a copy of your

124
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,980
recently published book, Transcendental Criminal Psychology. I found your book informative

125
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,100
and a very interesting read, and it pleases me to see that a student of mine from Dusseldorf

126
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,600
University has now become a leading authority in the field of criminal psychology. Now I

127
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,700
- I have a question for you regarding another matter.

128
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,020
You told me in a phone conversation

129
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,860
that you conducted a lengthy interview

130
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,880
with the serial murderer, Peter Juergens.

131
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,340
After you spoke with him, you told me that Juergens claimed

132
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,000
that a friend of his had encouraged him

133
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,020
to murder the victims.

134
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,880
Sadly, my memory isn't what it used to be,

135
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,480
so could you please tell me again,

136
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
what was the name of Juergens' friend

137
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,640
whom he said told him to kill?

138
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,380
I'd appreciate that information, as it may aid an associate of mine.

139
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,180
P.S.

140
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,320
As I mentioned earlier, you were quite a student in college and excelled in my class.

141
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,480
And you had a fellow colleague who was equally bright.

142
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,960
You often competed with him for the best marks.

143
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,760
He graduated and became a neurosurgeon.

144
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,860
At any rate it seems that he's become a suspect in a multiple homicide case with your expertise

145
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:27,900
I'm hoping you could help me get a better picture of who he is. Please. Tell me everything you might know about him

146
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,300
What kind of person is he and where do you think he might be right now this dr. Tenma? I

147
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,480
Remember you you're a detective

148
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,040
Well, I used to be and now I'm a private investigator

149
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,020
I'm sorry to show up unannounced here at your door, ma'am.

150
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,720
And I hate to bring up a subject I know must be painful for you,

151
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,120
but I would appreciate it if I could ask you some questions again.

152
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,580
Of course you can.

153
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,060
It's been four years since I last spoke to the police,

154
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,220
and it seems like they're done with their investigation.

155
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,180
Mr. Schuwald?

156
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,320
Yes, I believe your mother was actually employed by him.

157
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
Wasn't she once the head housekeeper at his mansion?

158
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,440
She was, but she worked for Mr. Schuwald 20 years ago.

159
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,240
She wasn't fired, so do you happen to know why she quit?

160
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,580
Well, at that time, she became very ill,

161
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,660
and after her sickness, she only worked close to home, in the neighborhood.

162
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,120
Was that it, or could it be she had some problem with Mr. Schuwald?

163
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,000
No, not at all. They were actually quite good friends.

164
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,020
She told me that she used to read poetry to Mr. Schuwald when he was still able to see.

165
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,700
My mother just loved reading poems to him.

166
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,880
Come along. I want to show you something.

167
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,500
Look how generous he was to her.

168
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,780
I've kept all of them because they remind me of my dear mother.

169
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,880
Every one of those books are collections of poetry that were given to my mother as a thank you from Mr. Schubold.

170
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,060
How things change.

171
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,980
The head detective in the doorknock company president case is now just a private eye.

172
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,320
You worked as Mr. Gawk's chief business liaison and personal secretary.

173
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,520
I ask you once again, did anyone hold a grudge against him?

174
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,480
You mean, did anyone hate him?

175
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,480
There aren't enough hours in the day to count all the people who despised him.

176
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,780
In business, Mr. Gawk was such a fierce adversary

177
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,140
that he personally forced some of our competition to go bankrupt.

178
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,900
But there was another powerful and well-known businessman in Bavaria wasn't there.

179
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,260
How did Mr. Gauk feel about him?

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
I take it you mean Mr. Schuwald?

181
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,420
Well, they were lifelong rivals in business, but of course you knew that, right?

182
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,440
They knew each other very well.

183
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,860
When Mr. Gauk was still alive, Schuwald's company went bankrupt two times.

184
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,780
That second bankruptcy happened when Mr. Gauk undercut Schuwald's prices for the purpose of ruining him.

185
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,940
is that Mr. Gawk was consciously trying to crush him.

186
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,760
Mr. Shuvald made certain we suffered serious losses, too.

187
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,880
So then they both hated each other?

188
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,080
Of course.

189
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,160
A few times, they happened to be at the same party,

190
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,400
and if looks could kill, they both would have been dead.

191
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,100
Oh, it was very tense.

192
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,520
They had explosive fights.

193
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,080
Like two vipers.

194
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,800
But those snakes understood each other's every move.

195
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,180
Only those two tycoons could talk to each other on the same level.

196
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,240
I never felt like they were enemies.

197
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,340
This may sound weird, but they were really more like friends.

- Oh yeah, I knew Hans real well.

208
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,500
Poor Hans was one of those two people

209
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,740
that ended up being victims

210
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,800
in that awful Voice of God murder case.

211
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,420
That Hans was a good guy, he deserved better.

212
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,640
- Just what is it that makes you say

213
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,940
Hans was such a good guy?

214
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,480
- He was nice, always treated me to a drink or two.

215
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,500
- Generous, huh?

216
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,320
I heard that Hans used to work

217
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,040
for Mr. Schuwald as his driver.

218
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,780
He told me that, but he worked as Shuvald's driver almost 30 years ago.

219
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,720
Did Hans say why he stopped driving for Mr. Shuvald?

220
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,980
Well, that was around the time old Shuvald's company went bankrupt.

221
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,440
That's why he was fired, huh? So Hans never said that he and his boss didn't get along?

222
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,120
Listen to me. What I'm about to say is to honor the memory of Hans.

223
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,640
If ever there was a guy who could get along with anybody and everybody, it was Hans.

224
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,020
He was a prince. Even rich bastards like that vampire of Bavaria, Shuvald.

225
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,100
He treated us poor folks like kings and Hans always said he was the one who taught Shuvald about bird-watching.

226
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,120
He taught him about bird-watching?

227
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,860
Uh-huh. Hans said Shuvald was more like a happy kid than a vampire when he took him to the forest.

228
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,400
It's hard to believe that was two years ago.

229
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
But whenever I think of my dear husband,

230
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,740
I just can't understand why such a kind and wonderful man ended up being murdered.

231
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,320
It's unfair. He died so horribly.

232
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,360
You have my sympathies.

233
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,560
Pardon my asking, but I believe your husband grew up as an…

234
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:36,980
Orphan?

235
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,060
Yes, he lived in an orphanage till he was six,

236
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,420
then with different foster families until he was eighteen.

237
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,620
After that, he became an accountant.

238
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,300
Is it true Mr. Schuwald, the business tycoon,

239
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,400
asked your husband to be his corporate accountant?

240
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,400
He did, many times.

241
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,560
But my husband always turned him down.

242
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,240
My husband was quite busy with work at the time, but that wasn't why.

243
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,240
He said Mr. Schuwald had a different set of financial principles.

244
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,380
When it came to money, my husband was very honest.

245
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,480
Again, thank you so much. I appreciate the help.

246
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,220
My husband's killer. Will he ever be caught?

247
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,760
I'll try my best. If I can do it, I swear I'll catch him.

248
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:17,880
Well then.

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,320
Yes?

251
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,460
I forgot to ask you if you knew how your husband and Mr. Schuwald first met each other.

252
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,580
Oh, that. It seems they met in the forest.

253
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,920
The forest?

254
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,380
Yes, they met in the forest back when Mr. Schuwald could still see. It was a total coincidence.

255
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,680
What were they doing in a place like that?

256
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,040
They were both there bird-watching. After they met, they went to the forest together all the time.

like he was trying to run you over.

- Man, what a creep.

275
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,160
- Dr. Rackvine, I've re-examined all the evidence.

276
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,400
And what I found out supports what I told you before.

277
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,900
Some of the key murder cases that I wasn't able to solve

278
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,560
all point to one killer having just one motive.

279
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,120
There's the Voice of God murder case

280
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,020
and the Dornach Company President murder case.

281
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,440
murder case? Look at the three of them. They're all extremely different. The methods in which

282
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,660
they were committed, for example. And the victims weren't related to each other. None

283
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,680
of them even knew each other. However, I have discovered that all of them shared one common

284
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:15,400
bond. There was a man who connected all the victims. And because they knew him, they were

285
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,540
all murdered. Every one of them was killed to further isolate Mr. Schuwald.

286
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:27,380
Hmm. There's also another connection in these cases that's rather curious. In the

287
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,860
Dornach Company president case, his secretary said there was a certain young

288
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,340
man who was supposed to meet with Mr. Gauk right before he was murdered. And in

289
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,960
the Voice of God cases, under "I have heard the voice of God," this name was

290
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,080
scrawled there by the murderer. And then there's the Spira couple murder case.

291
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,920
Since both of them drowned, that case seemed to be unrelated to the others.

292
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,580
But the name of the killer given by the Japanese doctor, who was the only witness in that case, was the same.

293
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,240
It was the same name in every case.

294
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,360
Johan.

295
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,440
Huh?

296
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,360
I've been in touch with a former student of mine who's now a renowned criminal psychologist.

297
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,540
He interviewed a murderer who claimed he committed his crimes on his friend's orders.

298
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,960
In here, he wrote that friend's name.

299
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,840
and the name that's in this letter is Johan.

300
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,500
Johan is a common name, but based on what you found,

301
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,480
it's also possible that all these cases could be related.

302
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,040
If by chance your findings are true,

303
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,900
this Johan has been systematically murdering people

304
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,400
for the past four years.

305
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,880
I can't help but wonder why this man known as Johan

306
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,480
is trying to force Schuwald into complete isolation.

307
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,800
Oddly enough, Margot Langer, the woman who bore

308
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,160
Juvald's son, conveniently died as well.

309
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,340
And there was that young student who was pretending to be Juvald's son.

310
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,280
He conveniently killed himself as soon as he made his claim.

311
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,360
If Johan really does exist, I wonder where he is right now.

312
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,260
Perhaps he's close.

313
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,660
What a surprise! So Johan's decided to visit.
