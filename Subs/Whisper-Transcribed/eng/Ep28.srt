1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
That's good enough.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,920
When you say that, just what exactly do you mean, Mr. Shoevald?

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,780
I've decided that I've learned enough. I am calling off the investigation.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,960
But, sir, we had a breakthrough, and I'm close to another.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,020
I checked out Carl Neumann, and one thing's certain, that boy's your real son.

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,720
I'm quite grateful to you for all you've done.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,680
Now, hold on. There's still more to be done.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,140
There's still the Edmund Farran issue to figure out.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,780
Edmund pretended to be your son, but some evidence I uncovered seems to indicate that he didn't really commit suicide.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,100
If that's really the case, someone else is pulling the strings and may have killed Farran.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,700
It has been solved to my satisfaction.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,520
Father, I made some tea. Would you care for some?

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,600
Yes, I would.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,840
Oh, good afternoon, Detective.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,480
Hmm.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:06,740
would you care to join us no thank you I'll be going once again good work just send me your bill

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:13,960
good day it sure looks nice outside it does oh and Johan's come as well

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,280
what a surprise so Johan's decided to visit

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:28,160
Shuvald had always been known as a distrustful man with a sour disposition who would have thought

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,240
that he turned into such a good-natured soul when he found his son with that smile of his

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:42,340
who'd have guessed that people still call him the vampire of Bavaria what a surprise so Johan's

22
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,340
decided to visit.

23
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:42,320
We'll be right back.

24
00:02:42,340 --> 00:03:12,320
We'll be right back.

25
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:31,340
how cute so you're trying to track down this puppy huh what a job my client told me her

26
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:38,540
ex-husband basically dognapped the little fella I guess disputes over pets can be just as bad

27
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,200
one's over kids. You're right about that. I think I'll have some wine, if that's quite all right

28
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,620
with you. You go ahead. I'll be sticking with the sparkling water. I'm glad to hear you say that.

29
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,860
I know work's scarce at the moment, but it's a good choice on your part not to cloud your life

30
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:01,240
with alcohol. I'm doing okay, at least on that account. What do you mean? Are you saying there's

31
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,280
something else in your life that's bothering you? Well, I find that with all the free time I have

32
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,980
now I end up rehashing things a lot. Such as? I spend hours and hours pouring over this personal

33
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:19,100
notebook I have of unsolved crimes. Cases I never solved as a detective. How interesting. So tell

34
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:25,060
me, when you look at it, how do you feel? I feel frustrated. There were so many murder cases I

35
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,780
wasn't able to solve. It haunts me to think of those vicious killers still out there walking

36
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,940
around in our world. They're free because of my incompetence. Even now I can't seem to catch them.

37
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,020
You're being too hard on yourself.

38
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
You could have caught them.

39
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,580
You had the skills to solve those cases,

40
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,140
but your self-critical nature was impeding you, Richard.

41
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,540
You got frustrated that you couldn't read these murderers' minds,

42
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,860
and that caused you pain.

43
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,780
So I turned to alcohol?

44
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,020
Sure. Of course you did.

45
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,340
Gentlemen, dinner is served.

46
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,240
Oh, good. It's time to eat.

47
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,920
Actually, I think it would be in your best interest for you to keep trying.

48
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:13,420
Hmm, I would encourage you to keep looking at your old police notebook, but why I'll just become angry again

49
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,580
Stop thinking that way you have to analyze what you did in the past in a new light

50
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,920
Your mind is clearer now that should help

51
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,900
Let's be frank with each other

52
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,900
We both know that you shot a young serial killer when you were drunk and I must say you are facing the reality of what?

53
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,580
Happened that night admirably, but now Richard you face a far greater challenge

54
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:42,160
facing your thoughts when you pull that trigger you're still haunted by that boy

55
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,360
you see him in your mind every day don't you yeah when you brought everything to

56
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,320
light all those things festering under the surface that boy's ghost will

57
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,620
finally move on

58
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:30,480
I see.

59
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,240
When I've brought everything to light, huh?

60
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:41,960
the homer murder case is a good place to start the victim joachim homer had a long and steady

61
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,940
career as an accountant he was never involved in anything shady and had no enemies and when

62
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:55,280
he was murdered there were no signs of a robbery then there were those two voice of god cases

63
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,580
the victims were a former housekeeper and a chauffeur what connected those two killings

64
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,920
was that the words, I have heard the voice of God,

65
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,040
were left scrawled on a wall at both crime scenes.

66
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,720
The Dornach Company president case.

67
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,420
Lutagauk was one of the wealthiest businessmen in Bavaria,

68
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,320
and his body was discovered in the Hartoltz forest.

69
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,280
And then there's the Spira couple case.

70
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,900
Both were forcibly drowned,

71
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,760
and their bodies washed up along the Isar River later on.

72
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,720
This one's still being investigated

73
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,540
as one of a string of murders involving middle-aged couples.

74
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,420
A material witness in that case disappeared,

75
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,940
a Japanese doctor who's still on the run.

76
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,120
Oh, man.

77
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,880
The more unsolved cases I had, the more booze I drank.

78
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Then it felt good, but it's different now.

79
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,980
This is tough. It feels just like the doctor said.

80
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,460
So I'm sober, my mind is clear, and I'm feeling calm.

81
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,560
Hey.

82
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,820
Hold on a second.

83
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,380
Come on, think.

84
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,360
Think hard, Richard.

85
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,600
Huh?

86
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Huh?

87
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:46,520
so you tried doing it again and what was the result i did i looked at all my notes and i

88
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,000
thought of something new but then i you saw that boy's ghost again and once that happened you lost

89
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,460
your train of thought right uh-huh there's no need to worry when you have an important thought

90
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:09,320
like that sooner or later it will come back to you what was it that I realized

91
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,100
an idea flashed through my mind it felt like it was a key to solving one of

92
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:40,320
those cases just my imagination who's there show yourself whoever you are I'll catch you

93
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,440
This is like that time, way back.

94
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,440
I was running after that punk just like this.

95
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,200
I chased him down an alley.

96
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,300
Sorry for coming here so late at night, Doc.

97
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,960
Nonsense. If you think you've figured things out and you're ready to share them, go ahead then. Tell me everything.

98
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,340
Back then, I felt myself looking deep within that killer.

99
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,380
That's when I knew it existed in this world.

100
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,740
It was true evil.

101
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,480
And once I saw it, standing right there in front of me, I shot and killed him.

102
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,060
That's good. Thank you for sharing, Richard.

103
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,120
By telling me this, you're well on the road to recovery.

104
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,620
there's still more doctor it just came to me hmm that idea that it flashed

105
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,060
through my mind before all those unsolved cases I had been working to

106
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:00,960
solve separately I realized they are actually one single case

107
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,780
greetings my dear dr. Gillen I'm writing to thank you for sending me a copy of

108
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,380
of your recently published book,

109
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,720
Transcendental Criminal Psychology.

110
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,940
I found your book informative and a very interesting read,

111
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,360
and it pleases me to see that a student of mine

112
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,160
from Dusseldorf University has now become

113
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,280
a leading authority in the field of criminal psychology.

114
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,420
Now I have a question for you regarding another matter.

115
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,200
You told me in a phone conversation

116
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,940
that you conducted a lengthy interview

117
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,580
with the serial murderer, Peter Juergens.

118
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,420
After you spoke with him, you told me that Juergens claimed

119
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,860
a friend of his had encouraged him to murder the victims sadly my memory isn't what it used to be

120
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,220
so could you please tell me again what was the name of jurgens's friend whom he said told him to

121
00:11:49,220 --> 00:12:04,180
kill i'd appreciate that information as it may aid an associate of mine p.s as i mentioned earlier

122
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,780
you were quite a student in college and excelled in my class and you had a fellow colleague who was

123
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,780
equally bright you often competed with him for the best marks he graduated and became a neurosurgeon

124
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:21,860
at any rate it seems that he's become a suspect in a multiple homicide case with your expertise

125
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:27,100
i'm hoping you could help me get a better picture of who he is please tell me everything you might

126
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:33,400
know about him what kind of person is he and where do you think he might be right now this

127
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:41,320
dr. tenma I remember you you're a detective well I used to be and now I'm

128
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,880
a private investigator I'm sorry to show up unannounced here at your door ma'am

129
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,680
and I hate to bring up a subject I know must be painful for you but I would

130
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,960
appreciate it if I could ask you some questions again of course you can it's

131
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,960
been four years since I last spoke to the police and it seems like they're

132
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:05,340
done with their investigation. Mr. Schuvald? Yes, I believe your mother was actually employed by him.

133
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Wasn't she once the head housekeeper at his mansion? She was, but she worked for Mr. Schuvald

134
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,940
20 years ago. She wasn't fired, so do you happen to know why she quit? Well, at that time she became

135
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:23,560
very ill, and after her sickness she only worked close to home in the neighborhood. Was that it,

136
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,220
or could it be she had some problem with Mr. Schuvald?

137
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,020
No, not at all.

138
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,980
They were actually quite good friends.

139
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,800
She told me that she used to read poetry to Mr. Schuvald

140
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,020
when he was still able to see.

141
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,700
My mother just loved reading poems to him.

142
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,820
Come along. I want to show you something.

143
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,520
Look how generous he was to her.

144
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,780
I've kept all of them because they remind me of my dear mother.

145
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,800
Every one of those books are collections of poetry

146
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,960
that were given to my mother as a thank you from Mr. Schubold

147
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,060
How things change

148
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,360
The head detective in the Doorknock Company president case

149
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,980
is now just a private eye

150
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,380
You worked as Mr. Gauck's chief business liaison and personal secretary

151
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,560
I ask you once again, did anyone hold a grudge against him?

152
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,480
You mean, did anyone hate him?

153
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,480
There aren't enough hours in the day to count all the people who despised him.

154
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,820
In business, Mr. Gawk was such a fierce adversary

155
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,160
that he personally forced some of our competition to go bankrupt.

156
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,880
But there was another powerful and well-known businessman in Bavaria, wasn't there?

157
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,260
How did Mr. Gawk feel about him?

158
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,640
I take it you mean Mr. Schuwald?

159
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,420
Well, they were lifelong rivals in business, but of course you knew that, right?

160
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,440
They knew each other very well.

161
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,260
When Mr. Gauk was still alive,

162
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,880
Schuwald's company went bankrupt two times.

163
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,000
That second bankruptcy happened

164
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,200
when Mr. Gauk undercut Schuwald's prices

165
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
for the purpose of ruining him.

166
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,200
So what you're saying is that Mr. Gauk

167
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,900
was consciously trying to crush him.

168
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,740
Mr. Schuwald made certain we suffered serious losses, too.

169
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,860
So then they both hated each other?

170
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,080
Of course.

171
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,160
A few times they happened to be at the same party,

172
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,420
and if looks could kill, they both would have been dead.

173
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,100
Oh, it was very tense.

174
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,660
They had explosive fights like two vipers, but those snakes understood each other's every move

175
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,340
Only those two tycoons could talk to each other on the same level. I never felt like they were enemies

176
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,180
This may sound weird, but they were really more like friends

177
00:15:45,100 --> 00:16:07,780
Oh yeah, I knew Hans real well.

178
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,680
Poor Hans was one of those two people that ended up being victims in that awful Voice

179
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,240
of God murder case.

180
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,900
Hans was a good guy. He deserved better. Just what is it that makes you say Hans

181
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:25,220
was such a good guy? He was nice. Always treated me to a drink or two. Generous,

182
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,260
huh? I heard that Hans used to work for Mr. Schuwald as his driver. He told me

183
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,140
that, but he worked as Schuwald's driver almost 30 years ago. Did Hans say why he

184
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,980
stopped driving for Mr. Schuwald? Well, that was around the time old Schuwald's

185
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,980
company went bankrupt that's why he was fired huh so hans never said that he and his boss didn't

186
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,600
get along listen to me what i'm about to say is to honor the memory of hans if ever there was a guy

187
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,700
who could get along with anybody and everybody it was hans he was a prince even rich bastards like

188
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,900
that vampire of bavaria shoe vault he treated us poor folks like kings and hans always said he was

189
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,640
the one who taught shoe vault about bird watching he taught him about bird watching uh-huh hans said

190
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,880
Shuvold was more like a happy kid than a vampire when he took him to the forest.

191
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,100
It's hard to believe that was two years ago, but whenever I think of my dear husband,

192
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,740
I just can't understand why such a kind and wonderful man ended up being murdered.

193
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,940
It's unfair. He died so horribly. You have my sympathies. Pardon my asking,

194
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,600
but I believe your husband grew up as an...

195
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:36,980
Orphan?

196
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,060
Yes, he lived in an orphanage till he was six,

197
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,440
then with different foster families until he was 18.

198
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,620
After that, he became an accountant.

199
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,280
Is it true Mr. Schuvald, the business tycoon,

200
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,380
asked your husband to be his corporate accountant?

201
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,400
He did, many times.

202
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,540
But my husband always turned him down.

203
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,220
My husband was quite busy with work at the time, but that wasn't why.

204
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,240
He said Mr. Schuvald had a different set of financial principles.

205
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,540
when it came to money my husband was very honest again thank you so much I

206
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,640
appreciate the help my husband's killer will he ever be caught I'll try my best

207
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:23,720
if I can do it I swear I'll catch him well then oh one more thing yes I forgot

208
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,360
to ask you if you knew how your husband and mr. shoe vault first met each other

209
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,560
Oh, that. It seems they met in the forest.

210
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,900
The forest?

211
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,980
Yes, they met in the forest back when Mr. Schuwald could still see.

212
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,380
It was a total coincidence.

213
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,660
What were they doing in a place like that?

214
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,020
They were both there birdwatching.

215
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,040
After they met, they went to the forest together all the time.

216
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,160
Birdwatching.

217
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:05,980
more like a happy kid read poetry to mr. shoe vault or like friends

218
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:20,080
hey buddy you okay oh yeah I'm fine thanks that guy was driving like an

219
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,140
idiot from what I saw it looked more like he was trying to run you over man

220
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,480
- Man, what a creep.

221
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,700
- Dr. Rackvine, I've reexamined all the evidence,

222
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,820
and what I found out supports what I told you before.

223
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,080
Some of the key murder cases that I wasn't able to solve

224
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,960
all point to one killer having just one motive.

225
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,700
There's the Voice of God murder case,

226
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,700
and the Durnach Company president murder case,

227
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,100
the accountant murder case.

228
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,500
Look at the three of them.

229
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,740
They're all extremely different.

230
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,560
The methods in which they were committed, for example,

231
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,480
and the victims weren't related to each other.

232
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,160
None of them even knew each other.

233
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,860
However, I have discovered

234
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,220
that all of them shared one common bond.

235
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,020
There was a man who connected all the victims,

236
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,060
and because they knew him, they were all murdered.

237
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,640
Every one of them was killed to further isolate Mr. Schuwald.

238
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,520
- Hmm.

239
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
- There's also another connection in these cases

240
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,140
that's rather curious.

241
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,740
In the Dornach Company President case,

242
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,280
his secretary said there was a certain young man

243
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,140
who was supposed to meet with Mr. Gouk

244
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,140
right before he was murdered.

245
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,200
And in the Voice of God cases,

246
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,140
under I have heard the voice of God,

247
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,840
this name was scrawled there by the murderer.

248
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,460
And then there's the Spirit Couple murder case.

249
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,800
Since both of them drowned,

250
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,600
that case seemed to be unrelated to the others.

251
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,520
But the name of the killer given by the Japanese doctor

252
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,160
who was the only witness in that case was the same.

253
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,720
It was the same name in every case.

254
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,560
- Johan.

255
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,400
I've been in touch with a former student of mine

256
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,760
who's now a renowned criminal psychologist.

257
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,360
He interviewed a murderer who claimed

258
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,220
he committed his crimes on his friend's orders.

259
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,660
In here, he wrote that friend's name,

260
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,000
and the name that's in this letter is Johan.

261
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,280
Johan is a common name,

262
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,680
but based on what you found, it's also possible

263
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,220
that all these cases could be related.

264
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,200
If by chance your findings are true,

265
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,040
this Johann has been systematically murdering people

266
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,080
for the past four years.

267
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,980
I can't help but wonder why this man known as Johann

268
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,940
is trying to force Shuvald into complete isolation.

269
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,020
- Oddly enough, Margot Langer,

270
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,760
the woman who bore Shuvald's son,

271
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,960
conveniently died as well.

272
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,520
- And there was that young student

273
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,060
who was pretending to be Shuvald's son.

274
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,440
He conveniently killed himself as soon as he made his claim.

275
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,060
If Johan really does exist, I wonder where he is right now.

276
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:05,780
Perhaps he's close.

277
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,980
What a surprise.

278
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,820
So Johan's decided to visit.

279
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:18,060
Ah, Johan, the weather's so beautiful.

280
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,060
Yes, isn't it, sir?

281
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,300
You hunt there, he's right next to Shuvald.
