183
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,240

184
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,820
He's grown up well.

185
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,020
I saw him a year ago in Dusseldorf.

186
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,460
Kenzo. Let's start over. You... you need me.

187
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,320
Kenzo.

188
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,520
You belong to me.

189
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,840
I will get you back.

190
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,820
Because you're mine.

191
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,700
So, what are you up to these days?

192
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,620
I've heard all sorts of rumors.

193
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,380
The rumors are probably true.

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
I've been married and divorced three times now.

195
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,240
Between my father's inheritance and my alimony,

196
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,500
I'm living pretty comfortably.

197
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,260
But enough about me.

198
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,040
How has life been treating you, Dr. Becker?

199
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,040
Huh? I don't know.

200
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,820
Nothing's changed with me.

201
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,180
I still have no chance of moving up in the world.

202
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,180
Tenma's now Chief of Surgery.

203
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,940
Word is, he's on his way to becoming Hospital Director.

204
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,000
Love to be in his shoes, let me tell you.

205
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,160
But please, who am I kidding? It ain't so bad.

206
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,240
I still manage to have a good time.

207

There's more to life than promotions.

208
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,400
I'd never want to be like Tenma and have no time for women or fun.

209
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,360
What's the point?

210
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,820
Is Kenzo...

211
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,060
Do you know by any chance if Dr. Tenma ever did settle down?

212
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,220
No, not yet.

213
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,240
And to be completely honest, I've introduced him to quite a few very nice women.

214
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,360
But you know him, no interest at all. His work comes first.

215
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,240
As a matter of fact, I'm about to set him up with a new girl.

216
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,360
God only knows if it's gonna work out.

217
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,680
She's the daughter of a state senator, and she is absolutely beautiful.

218
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,400
If she can't keep his attention, then I give up.

219
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,600
But, anyway, you called me about something.

220
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,540
How can I be of service, Ava?

221
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,100
You know, back when you were the daughter of the hospital director,

222
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,100
You gave me the time of day.

223
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,060
Who would have thought that you'd even think to call?

224
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,580
I understand you're well off, but really,

225
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,640

I mean it when I say it, Ava.

227
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,820
I'm more than happy to listen, anytime.

228
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,000

230

- Dr. Tenma and the state senator's daughter.

231
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,860
Don't let him meet her.

232
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,940

233
