00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,740
smoke.

13
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
Lighter.

14
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,080
- Where is my lighter?

15
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,780
My bag.

16
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,040
- I wanna know what you did with my bag.

17
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,500
- And I already told you it's the only bag you had.

18
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,680
- You liar, I know you're not telling me the truth.

19
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,920
I had another shoulder bag, where is it?

20
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,580
- Probably with whoever stole it from you

21
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,820
when you passed out drunk in the alley.

22
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,100
- What are you going to do about it?

23
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,620
I had valuables, important things in there.

24
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,060
- I'll tell you what,

25
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,160
you can fill out a theft report if you like,

26
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:34,160
but i really wouldn't get your hopes up

27
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,680
how the hell did you lose your keys

28
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,680
my bag was stolen last night just hurry up and open the room for me

29
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,480
what happened here

30
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,500
damn somebody really went to town

31
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,900
Oh, man, this is awful. I gotta change the lock now.

32
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,360
Which reminds me, Ms. Heinemann, you still owe me back rent.

33
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,340
I don't want to have to ask you again.

34
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
The deposit you put down has already run out.

35
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,220
I'm gonna need the rest of what you owe soon.

36
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,680
These people even broke into my damn suitcase.

37
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,120
Are you listening?

38
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,580
You have to pay for a new lock and all that back rent.

39
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,480
Well, I don't have any money.

40
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,400
What?

41
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,000
Fine, I'll get out. Don't worry.

42
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,800
Such a tragic story.

43
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,900
Still, I don't know what you expect me to do about any of it.

44
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,840
You know, I seem to remember you being the one who stormed out on me.

45
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,060
Oh, come on. That's all ancient history now.

46
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,660
So why not buy me a drink?

47
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,140
Please, Ava. It's just a stolen purse, for God's sake.

48
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,200
You must have had some extra cash tucked away somewhere.

49
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,900
Honestly, I've yet to meet another woman who could burn through money the way you do.

50
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,400
And here you are, finally coming to me for some cash.

51
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,440
This is it.

52
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,080
Welcome to rock bottom, baby.

53
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,080
So how much?

54
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,580
Huh?

55
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,400
I'll sleep with you, you know.

56
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,100
I'm asking you how much you'd be willing to pay.

57
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,100
My God.

58
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,200
Honey, as a general rule, most men won't pay to have sex with women they've already had a bunch of times.

59
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,980
You can at least buy me a drink.

60
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,420
Go find yourself a street corner to work.

61
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,240
Who knows, you might get lucky and meet some sad sack who's not too picky.

62
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,960
Desperate and middle-aged and drunk must be someone's type.

63
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:13,960
Yeah, I'm positive you didn't leave any purse here last night.

64
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,360
Maybe you left it wherever you went next.

65
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,020
I don't remember anything after I left this box.

66
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,820
You mentioned you had something important in your bag.

67
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,020
If it's worth any money, you might as well kiss it goodbye.

68
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,540
No, it's not. It's not worth anything at all.

69
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,040
Not any money, that is.

70
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,020
Hey, I've been looking for you.

71
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,880
I asked for you at the pub back there, and they told me you'd just headed in this direction.

72
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,940
Yeah, and who are you?

73
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,860
Are you serious? We had such a good time drinking last night.

74
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,820
I was drinking with you?

75
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,020
Your bag. That's why I was looking for you.

76
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,540
I guess this means I have to make awkward introductions again.

77
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,320
I'm Roberto. So, shall we grab a little something to eat?

78
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,760
Your hotel room? Really? That's terrible. I'm so sorry.

79
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,320
Well, whatever. I mean, it's not like you did it.

80
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,340
Well, no, obviously not. I didn't even dare look in your bag.

81
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,300
Oh, look, my hotel keys are still in here. A little late for those. I don't need them anymore.

82
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm sorry, it's all my fault. If I'd returned your bag sooner, you wouldn't have been kicked out of your room in the first place.

83
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,140
Hey, it wasn't your fault at all.

84
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,000
Besides, I'm very grateful that you gave me back my bag.

85
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,960
Honestly, I'm kind of grateful that you lost it.

86
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,300
Huh?

87
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,620
Well, last night as I watched you leave the pub, I sat there thinking to myself,

88
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,760
you shouldn't let this person slip away.

89
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,780
And now, thanks to your bag, here you are and here I am.

90
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,720
You have something very important in there, don't you?

91
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,580
I do.

92
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,040
This is all that I have left in the world.

93
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,520
Oh, a photo album. May I take a look?

94
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,440
You may.

95
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,280
Hmm

96
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,200
That's my father

97
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,800
He looks just like I imagined

98
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,940
He was a hospital director, right?

99
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,180
Yeah, did I talk about him last night?

100
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,100
You did

101
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,920
You spoke very highly of him

102
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,400
You mentioned that he died ten years ago

103
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,440
I could tell that you still miss him

104
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,660
Let's see

105
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,540
Ah, the ex-fiance

106
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,700
Please, don't tell me I told you about him

107
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,380
I believe his name was Tenma?

108
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,620
Quite a guy, this Tenma.

109
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,140
I really want to know what I said last night.

110
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,080
Well, I wouldn't make a habit of it.

111
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,580
It might end up making other men jealous.

112
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,680
Huh?

113
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,220
Odd, this page is empty.

114
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
Is that so?

115
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,400
The photos that were on this page,

116
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,880
looks like somebody tore them out.

117
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,120
Well, I guess I didn't need those pictures anymore.

118
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,600
So I see.

119
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,100
Hey.

120
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,800
Let's get a drink.

121
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,900
Sounds good.

122
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,700
So, you were running a security company.

123
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,020
I'm impressed.

124
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,380
Yeah, in the south of France.

125
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,540
Then we had a bad day and one of our better clients was killed on my watch.

126
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,400
So that was the end of that.

127
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,340
We're both going through tough times.

128
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,700
Nah, forget it.

129
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,080
Let's drink to the here and now.

130
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,760
Enjoy ourselves, you know?

131
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:55,920
Mm-hmm.

132
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,620
Oh, that song.

133
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,300
It's good stuff, huh?

134
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,660
So you like this song, too?

135
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,740
Of course.

136
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,960
Let's dance.

137
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:23,040
Come on.

138
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,660
Well, I don't really know how to dance.

139
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,140
Just put your arms around me.

140
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,660
Um.

141
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,780
Good.

142
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,000
I knew a man who loved this song.

143
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,300
He wasn't a very good dancer either.

144
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,280
So, you'd end up dancing like this?

145
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,380
That's right.

146
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:54,280
How fun.

147
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,280
How about another drink?

148
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,540
Just one more?

149
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,880
Thanks, but I'm good.

150
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,760
Lightweight.

151
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,960
Time for bed.

152
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,380
Sounds good to me, babe.

153
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:24,100

I've seen him, you know. Blonde, charming, handsome. He's grown up well.

161
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,220
I saw him a year ago in Dusseldorf.

162
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Kenzo, let's start over. You... you need me.

than promotions. I'd never want to be like Tenma and have no time for women or fun. What's

176
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:59,060
the point? Is Kenzo... Do you know by any chance if Dr. Tenma ever did settle down?

177
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,960
No, not yet. And to be completely honest, I've introduced him to quite a few very nice

178
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,260
women. But you know him, no interest at all. His work comes first. As a matter of fact,

179
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,220
I'm about to set him up with a new girl.

180
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,380
God only knows if it's going to work out.

181
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,680
She's the daughter of a state senator, and she is absolutely beautiful.

182
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,420
If she can't keep his attention, then I give up.

183
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,600
But, anyway, you called me about something.

184
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,520
How can I be of service, Ava?

185
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,080
You know, back when you were the daughter of the hospital director,

186
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,100
you never even gave me the time of day.

187
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,060
Who would have thought that you'd even think to call?

188
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,720
I understand you're well off.

189
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,640
But really, I think you're getting lonely, aren't you?

190
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,560
I mean it when I say it, Ava.

191
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,820
I'm more than happy to listen, anytime.

192
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Look, I don't want you to let them meet up.

193
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:48,860
Huh?

194
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,360
Dr. Tenma and the state senator's daughter.

195
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,860
Don't let him meet her.

196
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,940
Man, I should have known.

197
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,780
You're still in love with him.

198
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,240
Don't let him.

199
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:32,520
Do me a favor, don't screw it up this time.

200
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,020
I went out of my way to set this one up for you, Tenma.

201
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,440
Well, we'll see about that.

202
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,760
Hmm?

203
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
This is it.

204
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,200
This is the clock that Mr. Yunkers was talking about at the hospital.

205
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,340
Excuse me, about the clock in the window...

206
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,280
Hey, what's going on?

207
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,000
You're already late for your date.

208
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,200
What are you doing?

209
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:26,760
That's a very beautiful watch.

210
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,480
Oh, why, thank you.

211
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,460
I mean, I wear a watch, but mine is nothing, a trinket.

212
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,480
Honestly, I don't even check the time anymore.

213
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,840
I wonder why.

214
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,020
Time seems to be moving faster and faster.

215
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,920
Um, excuse me, but who are you?

216
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,260
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude,

217
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,120
but are you Senator Berger's daughter, Angelica?

218
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,160
Yes.

219
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,640
Goodness, you're a pretty little thing.

220
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,780
Well, aren't you?

221
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,220
Uh, thank you, I think.

222
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,640

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,820

231
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,000
Hey, Tenma!

232
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,940
Maybe if you give her a call right now,

233
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,920
she might come back.

234
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,340
Who knows?

235
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,760
- I wanna stop by the hospital for a quick minute.

236
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,600
- What?

237
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,420
At this hour?

238
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,640
Ah, I've had it with ya!

239
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,300
Fine, leave.

240
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:50,020
Kenzo.

241
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,340
You're mine.

242
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,260
You're all mine.

243
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,300
Mr. Junkers! Please, wait!

244
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,520
Mr. Junkers!

245
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,960
Kenzo, what's going on?

246
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,900
Wait! Kenzo! I have to talk to you!

247
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,560
Mr. Junkers!

248
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Kenzo! Please, just wait!

249
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Kenzo?

250
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:12,100
Oh, great, I broke my heel.

251
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Kenzie, I'm...

252
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
âª âª

253
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
- Kenzo.

254
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:03,560
âª âª

255
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:11,560
âª âª

256
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:19,560
âª âª

257
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:33,260
I saw him, you know.

258
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,780
Oh, yes.

259
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,120
A year ago in Dusseldorf.

260
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,940
I saw him.

261
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,740
It was Johann, I'm sure of it.

262
00:21:49,560 --> 00:22:08,520
You saw Johan, huh?

263
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,820
Guess I'll have to kill you.
