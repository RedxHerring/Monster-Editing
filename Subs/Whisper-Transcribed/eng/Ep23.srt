Be thankful something horrible didn't happen to you.

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,980
You got a cigarette?

13
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,000
Huh?

14
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,160
I'm just asking if you've got a cigarette.

15
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,200
There's no smoking in the station.

My bag!

I want to know what you did with my bag.

24
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,220
And I already told you it's the only bag you had.

25
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,560
You liar! I know you're not telling me the truth. I had another shoulder bag. Where is it?

26
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,160
Probably with whoever stole it from you when you passed out drunk in the alley.

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,960
What are you going to do about it? I had valuables, important things in there.

I don't wanna have to ask you again.

Yeah, I'm positive you didn't leave any purse here last night.

77
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,360
Maybe you left it wherever you went next.

78
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,840
I don't remember anything after I left this bar you mentioned you had something important in your bag

82
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,020
Asked for you at the pub back there

And they told me you'd just headed in this direction.

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,900

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,480
Your bag.

89
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,020
That's why I was looking for you.

90
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,540
I guess this means I have to make awkward introductions again.

91
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,320
I'm Roberto.

92
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,320
So, shall we grab a little something to eat?

93
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:21,380
Your hotel room really that's terrible. I'm so sorry. Well, whatever. I mean, it's not like you did it

94
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,340
Well, no, obviously not. I didn't even dare look in your bag

95
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,340
Oh, look, my hotel keys are still in here a little late for those. I don't need them anymore. I'm sorry

96
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,100
It's all my fault if I'd returned your bag sooner

97
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,140
You wouldn't have been kicked out of your room in the first place. Hey, it wasn't your fault at all

98
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,000
Besides, I'm very grateful that you gave me back my bag.

99
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,980
Honestly, I'm kind of grateful that you lost it.

Huh?

101
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,060
Well, last night, as I watched you leave the pub,

102
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,640
I sat there thinking to myself,

103
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,380
"You shouldn't let this person slip away."

104
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,780
And now, thanks to your bag, here you are and here I am.

105
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,340
Hmm.

106
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,720
You have something very important in there, don't you?

107
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,580
I do.

108
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,080
This is all that I have left in the world.

109
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,520
Oh, a photo album. May I take a look?

110
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,480
You may.

111
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,160
That's my father.

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,940
He looks just like I imagined. He was a hospital director, right?

113
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,180
Yeah. Did I talk about him last night?

114
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,900
You did. You spoke very highly of him.

115
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,400
You mentioned that he died 10 years ago.

116
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,420
I could tell that you still miss him.

117
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,640
Let's see.

118
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,600
Ah, the ex-fiance.

119
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,640
- Please, don't tell me I told you about him.

120
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,380
- I believe his name was Tenma?

121
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,620
Quite a guy, this Tenma.

122
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,140
- I really wanna know what I said last night.

123
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,080
- Well, I wouldn't make a habit of it.

124
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,580
It might end up making other men jealous.

125
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,720
(laughing)

126
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,220
- Well, odd, this page is empty.

127
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,900
- Is that so?

128
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
- The photos that were on this page

129
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,860
looks like somebody tore them out.

130
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,040
- Well, I guess I didn't need those pictures anymore.

131
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,600
- So I see.

132
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,120
- Hey.

133

Let's get a drink.

134
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,880
- Sounds good.

135
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,700
So, you were running a security company.

136
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm impressed.

137
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,800
Yeah.

138
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,380
In the south of France.

139
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,540
Then we had a bad day and one of our better clients was killed on my watch.

140
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,400
So that was the end of that.

141
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,320
We're both going through tough times.

142
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,700
Nah, forget it.

143
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,080
Let's drink to the here and now.

144
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,980
Mm-hmm

145
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,740
That's on it's good stuff, huh? So you like this song too, of course

146
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,900
Let's dance

148
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,040
- Come on.

149
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,660
- Well, I don't really know how to dance.

150
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,140
- Just put your arms around me.

151
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,760
Good.

152
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
I knew a man who loved this song.

153
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,280
He wasn't a very good dancer either.

154
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,300
So, you'd end up dancing like this?

155
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,180
That's right.

156
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,800
(laughing)

157
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,280
How fun. How about another drink?

158
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,880
Just one more? Thanks, but I'm good.

159
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,720
Lightweight.

160
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,360
Time for bed. Sounds good to me, babe.

161
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,780
Mm-hmm

162
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,270
There's just one more thing I want to ask you

163
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,700
What's that?

164
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,340
the pictures

165
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,940
Where are they?

166
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,760
What pictures?

167
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,000
Those photographs you took out of the album, where'd you hide them?

168
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,920
- Tell me.

169
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,280
You see, I'm on to your little secret.

170
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,220
You're looking for Tenma, aren't you?

171
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,580
I know you kept those photos from burning

172
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,660
and I'm sure you have them with you somewhere.

173
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,580
- What?

174
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,220
You're saying you know where Tenma is?

175
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,000
- Yeah.

176
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,060
(laughing)

177
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,720
[laughing]

178
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,720
The photographs that you're talking about...

[laughing]

182
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,780
I've seen him, you know.

183
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,240
Blond, charming, handsome.

184
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,820
He's grown up well.

185
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,020
I saw him a year ago in Dusseldorf.

186
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,460
Kenzo. Let's start over. You... you need me.

187
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,320
Kenzo.

188
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,520
You belong to me.

189
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,840
I will get you back.

190
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,820
Because you're mine.

191
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,700
So, what are you up to these days?

192
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,620
I've heard all sorts of rumors.

193
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,380
The rumors are probably true.

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
I've been married and divorced three times now.

195
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,240
Between my father's inheritance and my alimony,

196
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,500
I'm living pretty comfortably.

197
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,260
But enough about me.

198
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,040
How has life been treating you, Dr. Becker?

199
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,040
Huh? I don't know.

200
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,820
Nothing's changed with me.

201
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,180
I still have no chance of moving up in the world.

202
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,180
Tenma's now Chief of Surgery.

203
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,940
Word is, he's on his way to becoming Hospital Director.

204
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,000
Love to be in his shoes, let me tell you.

205
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,160
But please, who am I kidding? It ain't so bad.

206
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,240
I still manage to have a good time.

207
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,180
There's more to life than promotions.

208
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,400
I'd never want to be like Tenma and have no time for women or fun.

209
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,360
What's the point?

210
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,820
Is Kenzo...

211
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,060
Do you know by any chance if Dr. Tenma ever did settle down?

212
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,220
No, not yet.

213
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,240
And to be completely honest, I've introduced him to quite a few very nice women.

214
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,360
But you know him, no interest at all. His work comes first.

215
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,240
As a matter of fact, I'm about to set him up with a new girl.

216
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,360
God only knows if it's gonna work out.

217
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,680
She's the daughter of a state senator, and she is absolutely beautiful.

218
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,400
If she can't keep his attention, then I give up.

219
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,600
But, anyway, you called me about something.

220
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,540
How can I be of service, Ava?

221
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,100
You know, back when you were the daughter of the hospital director,

222
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,100
You gave me the time of day.

223
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,060
Who would have thought that you'd even think to call?

224
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,580
I understand you're well off, but really,

225
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,640
I think you're getting lonely, aren't you?

226
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,560
I mean it when I say it, Ava.

227
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,820
I'm more than happy to listen, anytime.

228
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,000
- Look, I don't want you to let them meet up.

229
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:48,860
- Huh?

230
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,380
- Dr. Tenma and the state senator's daughter.

231
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,860
Don't let him meet her.

232
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,940
- Man, I should have known.

233
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,820
You're still in love with him.

234
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,260
Don't let him.

I went out of my way to set this one up for you, Tenma.

You're already late for your date.

246

Why, thank you.

249

I mean, I wear a watch, but mine is nothing, a trinket.

250
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,500
I don't even check the time anymore.

251
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,840
I wonder why.

252
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,020

Um, excuse me, but who are you?

I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude,

255
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,120
but are you Senator Berker's daughter, Angelica?

256
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,140
Yes.

I'm sorry, what are you trying to say? I'm confused. Who are you exactly?

266
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,480
I have this tiny little birthmark on my inner thigh. He used to kiss it.

267
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,720
How he used to love kissing me there. Dr. Tenma, that is. You know him?

268
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,440
Oh

269
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,560
No

270
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,080
See see she left because you were late and it's all because you had to stop in that store. Oh

271
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,560
Too bad. I'm sorry about that. Can you do me a favor and apologize for me?

272
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,780
Wait, hey Tenma

273
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,960
Maybe if you give her a call right now, she might come back.
