1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:12,120
If I had known this was going to happen, I never would have taken that job.

2
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,800
I didn't like anything about it, right from the beginning.

3
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,000
It'll be okay.

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,140
Just hang in there.

5
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,320
You probably only need a few stitches.

6
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:51,220
I told you Robbie. No hospitals. Don't take me to the hospital. Get me the doctor. The

7
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:57,020
Hellbrow Hotel. Look Martin, I know what you're thinking. If you go to a hospital, the police

8
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,560
are going to drag you right back to prison. Look, I get it, but there's no time to drive

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,120
around looking for that so-called doctor. I said the hotel. The Hellbrow. Your life

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,840
Life is more important if you're alive.

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,400
Hurry up! The hell prowl!

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,100
I should have known.

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,080
Nothing good ever happens when there's a woman involved.

14
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,780
I'm begging you.

15
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,480
Hurry up.

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,880
Get me to Dr. Tenma right away.

- Behave yourself and don't be rude.

21

as someone you wouldn't be able to see under normal circumstances.

22
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,280
Well then, I guess I should have brought an autograph book.

23
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,880
If you fool around, I'll kill you.

24
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,460
Come in.

25
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,880
Allow me to introduce you to my man, Martin.

26
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,060
You may leave now.

27
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,620
I'm saying that I want to speak to your man in private.

28
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,660
Yes, as you wish, sir.

29
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,140
If you even think about screwing this up,

30
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,180
I'm going to kill you.

31
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,580
- Do you mind if I sit down in this chair here, sir?

32
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,740
- Go ahead.

33
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,220
How long have you been working for the baby?

34
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,880
- Oh, it's been almost three years.

35
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,180
- And before that?

36
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:44,140
Prison, huh? How many years? I was in for 8. Murder? Something like that. Considering

37
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:50,260
the crime, you got out rather quickly. I must have been a model inmate. I hear you're a

38
00:04:50,260 --> 00:05:00,360
model employee, too. I'll do whatever's required. Any kind of job at all. Except...

39
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,580
- Filled with work that involves women.

40
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,500
- Oh?

41
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,460
- Well, when it comes to jobs, I'm not really that picky.

42
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,060
But when it comes to women, I don't like to take

43
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,780
any kind of gig that might involve them.

44
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,380
- This involves a woman.

45
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,740
The job that I want you to do will require you

46
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,100
to keep watch over a certain woman for a while.

47
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,480
- What a terrible job.

48
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,240
- You'll go to Dusseldorf, pick up this lady,

49
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
and bring her back to me.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

51
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,360
You're perfect for the job because you

52
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,640
don't want an assignment that would necessitate

53
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,920
your involvement with women.

54
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,300
So I don't need to worry about you.

55
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,980
You'll be able to keep things strictly professional.

56
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,300
Are you Ava Heinemann?

57
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,380
Who wants to know?

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,280
My name's Martin, but I'm sure my name doesn't mean anything to you because I was hired by somebody to pick you up and take you back to Frankfurt with me.

59
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,140
By whom?

60
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,500
A tall man wearing glasses and a rather expensive suit.

61
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,840
A tall man wearing glasses? He's not associated with Roberto, is he?

62
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,000
Look, I really don't know much about him, other than the fact that he seems to be very important.

63
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,920
If you don't want to make the trip, I won't force you. I'm not too thrilled with the idea myself.

64
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,340
Right now someone is after me you don't say so how would you like to be my bodyguard?

65
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,780
Well, that is kind of part of my assignment. Anyway, wait here

66
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,520
Carry it

67
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,490
Let's go this is better than letting him kill me

68
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,750
What a pain in the ass.

69
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,410
The way she swings her hips, the smell of her perfume.

70
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,890
This is infuriating.

71
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,050
I hate this job.

72
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,790
Why don't you talk to me, Martin?

73
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,390
Alright.

74
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,370
If that's what you want me to do, what exactly should we talk about?

75
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,430
I don't really feel like talking now.

76
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,490
Then let's continue to be quiet.

77
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,850
How about a drink?

78
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,470
Have any alcohol on you?

79
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,890
Sorry, but I never touch the stuff.

80
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,990
I'm going to check out the dining car.

81
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,150
O-oh...

82
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,190
I see, so you're traveling alone, huh?

83
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,750
As luck would have it, I'm also traveling by myself.

84
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,770
Hey, why don't you tell me where you're staying? I'll pay you a little visit later.

85
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,990
Ah, let me give you my card. You may need--

86
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,850
What are you doing, pal?

87
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,970
What am I doing?

88
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,630
This woman asked me for a drink, so I gave her one.

89
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,310
Don't you lay a finger on her.

90
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,250
You don't even talk while you're having dinner?

91
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,030
Like I said before, I'll talk if you want me to.

92
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,790
I'm just curious as to why you don't drink.

93
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,910
My mother was a terrible alcoholic, but I don't mind if you drink.

94
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,530
Doesn't bother me at all, really.

95
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,490
If your mother drank, I'm sure she probably had a very good reason.

96
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,090
Oh, you think so?

97
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,470
Yes, I do. And I should know I have a very good reason for my drinking.

98
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,510
You might as well go ahead and tell me about it.

99
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,890
If you don't want to eat your meal in silence.

100
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,610
It could take a long time.

101
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,270
Hey, I'm in no rush.

102
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,050
I used to have someone I was going to marry.

103
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:00,230
He was Japanese and a neurosurgeon, absolutely brilliant at his work.

104
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,190
So then, you know what I did?

105
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,270
I tried to shoot my former fiancé.

106
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:24,130
Well, aren't you surprised that I picked up the nearest loaded gun and tried to kill that

107
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,530
man?

108
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,450
But you didn't actually do it.

109
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,750
Let me assure you your story is a whole lot better than mine

110
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,410
I'm listening. Why is my story better? Tell me I want to know I

111
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,130
Shot her. I actually went and pulled the trigger

112
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:46,030
My girlfriend and some guy were going at it in the bedroom. I

113
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,650
Went and shot both of them until there were no more bullets in the gun

114
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,430
The room was filled with the smell of their blood and her perfume

115
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:02,430
and reality set in there I was standing in the middle of everything all alone

116
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:09,310
Wow you're an idiot you know that you're probably right

117
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,050
(sighs)

118
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,770
I hate this job.

119
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,390
My boss is waiting inside this hotel.

120
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,570
You said you killed people, so just keep your filthy hands off me.

121
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,870
Which room?

122
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,610
I'll take you up to 'em.

123
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,470
Your attire is inappropriate. There's a dress code for this hotel.

124
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,750
Just wait in the car.

125
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,790
Ask for room 1014.

126
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:09,670
I don't know what the man in glasses will say to her, but if she refuses his deal, this

127
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:14,170
crappy job will be over once and for all, and I won't have to see her anymore.

128
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,990
What's the matter?

129
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,190
You don't look like it went very well.

130
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,170
Actually, it wasn't such a bad offer.

131
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,270
He said I could use this card as much as I want to.

132
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,810
Well, come on already, let's get going.

133
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,890
Where exactly are we going?

134
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,870
On a little shopping spree.

135
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,270
I really hate this job.

136
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,630
- Next on our itinerary.

137
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,170
- This is a menswear store.

138
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,570
- That's very astute of you.

139
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,670
I'm buying you clothes to make you presentable.

140
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,850
- But I'm okay with the clothes I got.

141
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,610
- Well, I don't care for them.

142
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,150
I don't want the men accompanying me all day

143
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,310
to be dressed like a bung.

144
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,250
I like this one.

145
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,690
Now to find a necktie.

146
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,210
Kenzo hmm here go try this one on for me

147
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,010
Neckties I hate them

148
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,550
How is it well hmm you look a little better now

149
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,790
But fix your tie it looks sloppy like that

150
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,550
Stop walking that way. You look like a thug with your shoulders slouched down.

151
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,290
I think the way I'm walking is perfectly normal.

152
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,710
Your idea of normal is lowbrow.

153
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,270
I've decided that from now on I want you to be my escort.

154
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,490
That means wherever we might go, I want you to look and act normally.

155
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,930
Don't embarrass me.

156
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,410
That's your job. That's what you were hired for.

157
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,230
Yeah, that's my job.

158
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,810
Don't put your elbows on the table.

159
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,190
Huh?

160
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,410
Fork in your left hand, knife in the right.

161
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,790
Don't make sounds when you chew your food.

162
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,950
So it's all true then, right?

163
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,190
What do you mean?

164
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,290
You know, that you were the daughter of the director of a big hospital.

165
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,750
Did you think I was lying?

166
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,830
Before I brought you to this city, I thought you were just a sloppy alcoholic with a lot of rough edges.

167
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,590
What about now?

168
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,390
You're a classy looking lady.

169
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,550
The way I appear now is my true form.

170
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,690
Yes, Eva Heinemann has finally returned to her rightful place in the city.

171
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,030
What's that you're holding?

172
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,570
An invitation to a big party.

173
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,150
Party, huh? Yes, that's the job that was given to me. What are you talking about?

174
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,810
I was told I have to attend several social gatherings. That's all I really know

175
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,270
Aren't you happy could be a fun job for you. You're coming with me. Yeah

176
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,090
You must escort me and appear to be a gentleman worthy of accompanying me

177
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,370
Just when I thought this job couldn't get any worse

178
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,430
How does it feel, being back in the company of people from your old social circle?

179
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,510
What could possibly be so funny?

180
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,890
Jeez, I can't tell what any of these people are going on about.

181
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,890
The weather report. The stock market.

182
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,990
I don't even know what language they're speaking.

183
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,890
Sounds like gibberish to me.

184
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,570
I'm starting to feel sick.

185
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,550
Oh, there you are.

186
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,710
Yeah. Hey, you don't have to worry about me.

187
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,190
Enjoy yourself.

188
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,290
- Let's go.

189
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:02,810
- Huh?

190
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,370
- We're leaving.

191
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,230
- What?

192
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,290
Hey, hold on.

193
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,890
- My job here is done.

194
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,390
He's not at this party.

195
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,330
We can go now.

196
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,370
- Who's not?

197
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,410
What are you talking about?

198
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,670
- Take me away from here.

199
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,490
Anywhere at all is fine with me.

200
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,850
Just take me away now.

201
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,590
- I didn't know at the time.

202
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:47,610
why her hands were shaking well I've managed to survive the day what's wrong

203
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:54,330
thought you told me you returned to the place where you truly belong every day I

204
00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:00,070
used to live like those people you saw at the party I thought once I entered

205
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,050
The real me would fit in and feel right at home.

206
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,410
So I guess...

207
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,210
now you've discovered that you only feel comfortable in places like this bar.

208
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,530
No! This isn't the place for me either!

209
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,930
This isn't it! That wasn't it!

210
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,170
No matter where I go, I don't seem to belong!

211
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,150
I already knew that about myself!

212
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,350
I don't fit in.

213
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,790
As soon as this job is completed,

214
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,010
I didn't want to be killed by Roberto in Dusseldorf,

215
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,090
where I was so worn and shabby.

216
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,230
I thought it would be better to be killed here,

217
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,010
where I could die as the beautiful Eva Heinemann.

218
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,650
But when you die, it's all the same anyway.

219
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:17,550
I wanted to protect her it's a bad habit of mine always has been right then I

220
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,770
thought I want to protect this woman

221
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,470
Nobody ever gets the drop on you.

222
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,030
How in the hell did this happen?

223
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:58,090
I'm going to tell everything to Dr. Tenma. Better hurry.

224
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,510
Just hang in there, Martin. We're very close. Almost there.

225
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:17,330
Damn Naitai. If I hadn't put this on, I never would have had to go anywhere near there.

226
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,010
I never would have had to see such terror.
