7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
He has a split personality?"

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,560
As a split personality?

9
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:48,540
We'll be right back.

10
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:58,560
♪♪

11
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:08,560
♪♪

12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's see if I got this straight.

13
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,000
So you told us when you arrived at the warehouse,

14
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,400
you witnessed the Asian man and the arsonist engaging in a verbal argument.

15
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,880
According to your statement, Anna, as soon as the Asian man saw you there, he quickly fled.

16
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,060
So, Miss Liebert, is that exactly how you saw it?

17
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,620
Yes, sir.

18
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Well, it's good that firebug ended up turning himself in.

19
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,120
He confessed that he's a right-wing extremist, said he was celebrating his people when he lit the fire.

20
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,980
Anyway, Miss Liebert, your record's clean, so that's all we need from you today.

21
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,880
We do appreciate your cooperation.

22
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,520
So then you're saying that I can go home now, Detective?

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,740
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:11,160
Oh, hold on. There's one thing I forgot to ask about.

25
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,800
The townsfolk refer to the Asian man you mentioned as Dr. Tenma.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,700
Miss Liebert, you wouldn't happen to know anything else about this guy, would you?

27
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,000
No, I don't know anything about him.

28
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,800
Tell me, what are you thinking?

29
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,220
I'd say from the way Miss Liebert was dressed, she might just be a high-class call girl.

30
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,040
That isn't what I meant.

31
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:38,680
Huh?

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,240
I'm talking about Dr. Tenma.

33
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,060
When we first spoke to the Turks from that district, all of them referred to our Asian guy as Dr. Tenma.

34
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,620
But as soon as we told them the doctor was under investigation and suspected to be a serial killer,

35
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,860
they got real tight-lipped.

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,440
All of a sudden, none of them knew who he was.

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:09,480
They told me I'm responsible for you now.

38
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,880
Mr. Russo.

39
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,460
It's so great to see you.

40
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
I was worried about you.

41
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,600
When you left town, it was just so sudden.

42
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,960
Now that's more like it.

43
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,100
There. Now you look more like the Anna I've always known.

44
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,460
I like you better in casual clothes.

45
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,960
Come on, sit down and eat. I ordered what you like. Enjoy.

46
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,480
Mr. Rosso, aren't you going to eat?

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,740
No, thanks, dear. I've already eaten.

48
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,800
I'll just have me some coffee.

49
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,240
Go on, dig in.

50
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,400
Thank you. I am pretty hungry.

51
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:15,900
what's so funny you haven't changed you still take five sugars in your coffee

52
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:24,140
well that's what tastes best i say coffee isn't any good at all if it isn't sweet

53
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,140
it's good to see you can smile

54
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:37,420
It's good to see you can smile

55
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,460
I know you're in the middle of a big job interview

56
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,500
And up to now you've looked quite serious

57
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,300
But you smiled when you saw me put all that sugar in my coffee

58
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,640
Your name's Anna...

59
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,880
Right, my name is Anna Liebert

60
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,740
So, uh...

61
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,020

quite a boost except except what do me a favor show off that smile a little more all right

64
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:21,020

Hold on.

89
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,900
Just forget about trying to make time with my Anna.

90
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,360
I'd hate to have to hurt you.

91
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,560
Oh, boy, listen to the crybaby Rosso, everybody.

92
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,000
He's suddenly acting all tough.

93
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,580
Hey, wait till you get a load of this.

94
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,240
Last week, he was at my house watching a TV movie,

95
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,660
bawling like a baby.

96
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,160
Hey.

97
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,920
Another order of squid ink risotto.

98
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,080
Ah, Summertime is playing across the street.

99
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,200
Huh?

100
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,780
That old movie house is screening Summertime.

101
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,420
See there?

102
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,140
What a city.

103
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,960
Frankfurt has so many great old movie theaters.

104
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,580
that movie was on TV just last week that one really brings me to tears have you

105
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:10,820

106
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,440
actually in the city of Venice folks don't know the history of Venice it was

107
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,140
a port city back in medieval days and everyone called it the city of water the

108
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,600
entire city of Venice was originally built on a lagoon there are these canals

109
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,120

121
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:56,980

122
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:05,680
private time. It's none of my business where you go. I've been learning how to shoot a gun. Oh,

123
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Oh, learning to shoot.

124
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,680
That's right. At Mr. Venkel's firing range.

125
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,680
You're learning at Venkel's place, huh?

126
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
He's good people.

127
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680

Tell me, what's it taste like?

141
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,600
Like there's some garlic, olive oil, parsley, and not much else.

142
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,480
So the flavors of the other things you put in there are gone, right?

Mm-hmm.

144
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,420
That just means you haven't learned how to make it proper.

145
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:09,480
this cooking's tough stuff anything worth learning takes practice

146
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,860
I'm all done with the bathroom mr. Rosso I'm heading for bed now so

147
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:39,000
When I was younger, I never realized that movies like this existed.

148
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,240
Mr. Rosso, movies have always affected you deeply.

149
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,600
That's true.

150
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,700
When I was younger, I always wanted to watch movies, but with work, I never had the time to.

151
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,760
Back then, I ate a lot of fabulous meals, but to be really honest, I never felt any of them had any taste or flavor.

152
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,300
I didn't even appreciate the taste of sugar then.

153
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,180
Really? Is that the truth?

154
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,600
You know my past. Isn't that right, Anna?

155
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,120
Well, after you left, I checked up on you, and I know what happened.

156
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:40,360
You're really Nina Fortner, and you disappeared two years ago after your parents were murdered.

157
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,380
Exactly what were you looking for me to do?

158
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,500
Were you looking for me to do a hit, or did you want me to teach you to kill?

159
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,540
I guess I wanted to learn from you. That was it.

160
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,500
So how did you find out about me and what I did?

161
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,460
From one of my professors at law school.

162
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,920
He had done research on you and all the cases you were involved in.

163
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:17,120
The Ristorante Nino case, the Sacco Milano case, the Sabatini murder case.

164
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,260
You were called into court to testify in all three of those murder cases.

165
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,500
And in each of those cases, all charges were dropped due to a complete lack of evidence.

166
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,020
However, my professor came up with a theory about it that made sense

167
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,080
There was only one conclusion

168
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,940
A world-class hitman committed all three of the murders

169
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,100
And he said that you were that man

170
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:05,640
I suppose you want to know how many people I killed.

171
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,380
To be honest with you, I can't even remember.

172
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,400
I was never a good kid.

173
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,920
And before I knew what was what, I was in way over my head.

174
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,160
Robbery, blackmail.

175
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,120
If you can name it, then I did it.

176
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,980
And eventually, I became a hitman.

177
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,420
I rewarded myself by eating very well

178
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:41,120
I never had any feelings about it

179
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,460
It was just my job

180
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,720
This one day, I was doing what I always did.

181
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,520
Waiting to kill some faceless guy.

182
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,340
It was sunny, and he was alone.

183
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,640
I'd been doing it so long I was numb

184
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,000
I didn't know how many I'd killed or who was next

185
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,840
I had him as good as dead

186
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,200
He had ordered a coffee

187
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,720
And as I watched, he started putting sugar in it

188
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,160
One spoonful

189
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,140
Two spoonfuls

190
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,500
And three

191
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,800
And four

192
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,260
After the fifth spoonful, he stopped

193
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,640
That moment started me finally tasting the coffee I drank

194
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,200
When I saw how he was enjoying that coffee, I couldn't do it

195
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:26,300
That was the day I put my gun down for good.

196
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,140
That part of my life is done.

197
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,680
I know I can't kill people and steal their simple pleasures.

198
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,640
After all the time we've spent together, I don't get it.

199
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,080
You never asked me to teach you how to kill someone.

200
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,240
I decided...

201
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,980
I decided that getting you involved wouldn't be right.

202
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,160
Do you really have to go, Nina?

203
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,420
Goodbye.

204
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,400
Thank you for everything, Mr. Rosso.

205
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,560
You should know killing's easier than you think.

206
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,380
You just have to forget how sweet the sugar is.
