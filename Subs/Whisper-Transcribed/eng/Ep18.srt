1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey, wait up! What the hell are we doing here, anyway? Come on, let's get out of here!

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,360
I give up. There's no use with this guy. I guess I'll be starving in Bro forever.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,560
If only I still had that rug. Dammit.

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,880
Huh? The hell's that supposed to be?

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,520
"It's...a message...help...the monster inside me...is about to explode...what is

6
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,620
this supposed to mean?

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,280
He has a split personality?"

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:00,940
♪ I've got to be in this place ♪

9
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,440
(upbeat music)

10
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,020
(dramatic music)

11
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,040
Let's see if I got this straight.

12
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,800
So you told us when you arrived at the warehouse, you witnessed the Asian man and the arsonist

13
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,500
engaging in a verbal argument.

14
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,440
According to your statement, Anna, as soon as the Asian man saw you there, he quickly

15
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,860
fled.

16
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
So, Miss Liebert, is that exactly how you saw it?

17
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,620
Yes, sir.

18
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,080
Well, it's good that firebug ended up turning himself in.

19
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,140
He's a right-wing extremist, said he was celebrating his people when he lit the fire.

20
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,980
Anyway, Miss Liebert, your record's clean, so that's all we need from you today.

21
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,060
We do appreciate your cooperation.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,500
So then you're saying that I can go home now, detective?

23
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,800
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,800
Oh, hold on.

25
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,160
There's one thing I forgot to ask about.

26
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,820
The townsfolk refer to the Asian man you mentioned as Dr. Tenma.

27
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,700
Miss Liebert, you wouldn't happen to know anything else about this guy, would you?

28
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,120
No, I don't know anything about him.

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,780
Tell me, what are you thinking?

30
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,220
I'd say from the way Miss Liebert was dressed, she might just be a high-class call girl.

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,040
That isn't what I meant.

32
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:38,700
Huh?

33
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,280
I'm talking about Dr. Tenma.

34
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,140
When we first spoke to the Turks from that district,

35
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,060
all of them referred to our Asian guy as Dr. Tenma.

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,680
But as soon as we told them the doctor was under investigation

37
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,600
and suspected to be a serial killer,

38
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,860
they got real tight-lipped.

39
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,440
All of the sudden, none of them knew who he was.

40
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,420
They told me I'm responsible for you now.

41
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,000
Yana, it's so great to see you. I was worried about you.

42
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
When you left town, it was just so sudden.

43
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,000
Now that's more like it.

44
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,080
There. Now you look more like the Yana I've always known.

45
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,200
I like you better in casual clothes come on sit down and eat. I ordered what you like enjoy

46
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,820
Mr.. Rosso aren't you going to eat? No. Thanks dear. I've already eaten. I'll just have me some coffee

47
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,520
Go on dig in thank you. I am pretty hungry

48
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,840
What's so funny?

49
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,840
You haven't changed. You still take five sugars in your coffee.

50
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,180
Well, that's what tastes best.

51
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,140
I say coffee isn't any good at all if it isn't sweet.

52
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,160
It's good to see you can smile.

53
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,360
It's good to see you can smile.

54
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,500
I know you're in the middle of a big job interview and up to now, you've looked quite serious.

55
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,280
But you smiled when you saw me put all that sugar in my coffee.

56
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,080
Your name's Anna...

57
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,840
Right. My name is Anna Liebert.

58
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,420
So, uh...

59
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,900
Well, Miss Liebert, the job's yours.

60
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,000
You'll start today.

61
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,280
Having a young lady like you waiting tables in my cafe might give my business quite a boost.

62
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,340
Except...

63
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,960
Do me a favor. Show off that smile a little more, alright?

64
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,940
When you smile, it'll make everyone feel good.

65
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,400
Thank you so much for the job. I'll work very hard, really.

66
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,440
Chances are you may not have to.

67
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,460
This is an Italian restaurant in a small town.

68
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,320
Two tables of folks is as busy as it gets.

69
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
- Anna, come stand over here. - Sure.

70
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,800
I'll place all the orders here on the bar,

71
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,300
and you'll take them from here to the customer's tables.

72
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,420
All used plates go on that side of the counter,

73
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,140
the wine is right here, and the glassware is back here.

74
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,620
You'll find more bottles of wine above this shelf,

75
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
on these little hooks.

76
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,480
So more wine is above the shelf and glassware is back there.

77
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,040
This is for water.

78
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,580
Got it.

79
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,240
Morning, Rosso.

80
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,980
So, how are you today?

81
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,340
Good morning and welcome.

82
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,780
I'm starving.

83
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,380
Nice to meet you, sir.

84
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,540
My name's Anna.

85
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,940
It's not possible.

86
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,100
There's no way someone as pretty as you could be a waitress in a place like this.

87
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,600
Huh?

88
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,200
Well, you're awake, and my place is classier than you thought.

89
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,280
Introducing Anna, our new waitress. She'll be serving here from now on.

90
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,200
Like I said, I'm pleased to meet you.

91
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,600
You really mean it?

92
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,480
(gulps)

93
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:14,780
- Huh.

94
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:17,580
(laughs)

95
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,540
- Hey, Anna, how about a nice plate of carbonara?

96
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,840
- Hey, Anna, I think I'll have a bolognese.

97
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,060
Can you get me some more water when you have a chance?

98
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,280
Uh-huh, right away.

99
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,480
Order up. One bolognese and one carbonara.

100
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,920
Coming right up.

101
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,200
All right, here you go, sir.

102
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,700
You're a gem, Anna.

103
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,760
Vongole and rigatoni.

104
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,240
And table three's fettuccine order is up.

105
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,040
Okay.

106
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,280
Hey, Rosso.

107
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,920
Come on, you gotta tell us how you tricked this cutie

108
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,080
into working here for you.

109
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,660
I didn't have to trick her.

110
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,840
Guess I was just my charming self.

111
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,160
Hey, Anna, if you're free tonight,

112
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,500
how about you let me take you out to a real restaurant?

113
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,260
Come on, it'll be fun.

114
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,280
Hold on.

115
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,900
Just forget about trying to make time with my Anna.

116
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,380
I'd hate to have to hurt you.

117
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,560
Oh, boy, listen to the crybaby Rosso, everybody.

118
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,000
Suddenly acting all tough.

119
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,580
Hey, way to get a load of this.

120
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,240
Last week, he was at my house, watching a TV movie,

121
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,660
falling like a baby.

122
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,360
[grunting]

123
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,360
Hey.

124
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,780
[laughing]

125
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,960
Another order of squid ink risotto!

126
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,100
Ah! Summertime is playing across the street.

127
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:41,990
Huh?

128
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,420
That old movie house is screening Summertime. See there?

129
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,020
What a city! Frankfurt has so many great old movie theaters.

130
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,800
That movie was on TV just last week.

131
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,380
That one really brings me to tears.

132
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,400
Have you ever seen "Summertime"?

133
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,920
- Mm-mm.

134
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,100
- It's touching.

135
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,740
The whole thing takes place in Italy,

136
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,440
actually in the city of Venice.

137
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,880
Folks don't know the history of Venice.

138
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,440
It was a port city back in medieval days

139
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,580
and everyone called it the city of water.

140
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,340
The entire city of Venice was originally built on a lagoon.

141
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,700
There were these canals

142
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,060
I'd really like to go see it with you some day.

143
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,200
It's just beautiful.

144
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,080
It sounds to me like you've been there before.

145
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,440
I have.

146
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,100
The film's soundtrack is great music.

147
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,360
It's very well composed.

148
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,480
I bet you've heard its theme song.

149
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,180
I'd say most folks have heard it.

150
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,320
It was a popular, very well-known song.

151
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,940
Tell me, how does it go?

152
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,600
Let's see.

153
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,620
[humming]

154
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,640
Hmm?

155
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,340
Hey, I know. Let's go across the street and see it right now.

156
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,680
We've missed some, but they'll still let us in.

157
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,040
Oh, it's just... well, I...

158
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,120
Some other time. It is kind of late, and you're still eating.

159
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,060
Sorry.

160
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,540
[music stops]

161
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,620
[birds chirping]

162
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:18,980
[leaves rustling]

163
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,480
[children laughing]

164
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, I'm back.

165
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,020
Great! So, how was your break?

166
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,400
Oh, can I scrub that for you?

167
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,500
No, thanks. I can handle it.

168
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,420
I appreciate you letting me take off a few hours from work every afternoon.

169
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,580
Ah, it's no problem. It's always slow around this time of the day.

170
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,340
Anna, I don't want to be nosy, but...

171
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,380
Where do you go every day?

172
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,580
Hey, forget I asked. It's your private time. It's none of my business where you go.

173
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,300
I've been learning how to shoot a gun.

174
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,800
Oh, learning to shoot.

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,400
That's right. At Mr. Venkel's firing range.

Tell me, Mr. Oso, have you ever shot a gun before?

179
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,260
Me, shooting guns? No way!

180
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,360
Honestly, I get all nervous just looking at them.

Take a taste.

195
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,240
No, you should try it.

196
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,680
Let's try it.

197
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,120
Tell me, what's it taste like?

198
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,620
Like there's some garlic, olive oil, parsley, and not much else.

199
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,480
So the flavors of the other things you put in there are gone, right?

200
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,220
Mm-hmm.

201
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,420
That just means you haven't learned how to make it proper.

202
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,140
This cooking's tough stuff.

203

Anything worth learning takes practice.

I'm all done with the bathroom, Mr. Oso. I'm heading for bed now, so...

205
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,980
When I was younger, I never realized that movies like this existed.

206
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,420
(crickets chirping)

207
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,200
- Mr. Rosso, movies have always affected you deeply.

208
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,620
- That's true.

209
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,780
When I was younger, I always wanted to watch movies,

210
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,700
but with work, I never had the time to.

211
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,720
Back then, I ate a lot of fabulous meals,

212
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,980
but to be really honest,

213
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,740
I never felt any of them had any taste or flavor.

214
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,260
I didn't even appreciate the taste of sugar then.

215
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,040
- Really?

216
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,180
Is that the truth?

217
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,620
You know my past. Isn't that right, Anna?

218
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,160
Well, after you left, I checked up on you. And I know what happened.

219
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,360
You're really Nina Fortner. And you disappeared two years ago, after your parents were murdered.

220
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,360
"Exactly what were you looking for me to do?

221
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,820
Were you looking for me to do a hit?

222
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,520
Or did you want me to teach you to kill?"

223
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,840
"I guess I wanted to learn from you.

224
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,680
That was it."

225
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,120
"So how did you find out about me and what I did?"

226
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,480
"From one of my professors at law school.

227
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,180
He had done research on you and all the cases you were involved in the Ristorante Nino case

228
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,120
the Sacco Milano case the Sabatini murder case

229
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,520
You were called into court to testify in all three of those murder cases and in each of those cases

230
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,560
All charges were dropped due to a complete lack of evidence

231
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:35,360
However, my professor came up with a theory about it that made sense there was only one conclusion a

232
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,660
A world-class hitman committed all three of the murders and he said that you were that

233
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,180
man.

234
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,240
I

235
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,620
suppose you want to know how many people I killed.

236
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,380
To be honest with you, I can't even remember.

237
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:17,920
I was never a good kid, and before I knew what was what I was in way over my head.

238
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,120
Robbery, blackmail, if you can name it, then I did it.

239
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,000
And eventually I became a hitman.

240
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,320
I rewarded myself by eating very well.

241
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,100
I never had any feelings about it.

242
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,500
It was just my job.

243
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,720
This one day, I was doing what I always did.

244
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,620
some faceless guy.

245
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,340
It was sunny, and he was alone.

246
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,640
I'd been doing it so long I was numb.

247
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,000
I didn't know how many I'd killed or who was next.

248
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
I had him as good as dead.

249
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,560
He had ordered a coffee, and as I watched,

250
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,500
he started putting sugar in it.

251
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,080
One spoonful.

252
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,860
Two spoonfuls.

253
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,460
And three.

254
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,780
And four.

255
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,220
After the fifth spoonful, he stopped.

256
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,640
That moment started me finally tasting the coffee I drank.

257
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,700
When I saw how he was enjoying that coffee,

258
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,180
I couldn't do it.

259
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,940
- That was the day I put my gun down for good.

260
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,580
That part of my life is done.

261
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,140
I know I can't kill people and steal their simple pleasures.

262
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,340
After all the time we've spent together, I don't get it.

263
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,140
You never asked me to teach you how to kill someone.

264
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:48,020
I decided I decided that getting you involved wouldn't be right

265
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,160
Do you really have to go, Nina?

266
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,420
Goodbye.

267
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,400
Thank you for everything, Mr. Rosso.

268
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,560
You should know killing is easier than you think.

269
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,380
You just have to forget how sweet the sugar is.
