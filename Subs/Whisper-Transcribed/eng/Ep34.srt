1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,940
He was released?

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,980
Yes. Johann Liebert was discharged this morning.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,760
Wow, that was fast.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,240
They said he just collapsed all of a sudden,

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,500
but I guess it couldn't have been anything too serious.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,040
Oh, you! You come by the library a fair amount.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,160
Hey, you're a librarian at the university, aren't you?

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,120
Oh, so they let him out already?

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,400
That's a relief. He gave me such a scare yesterday.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,760
So you were there when he collapsed, then?

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,380
Uh-huh. He was trying to track down a book,

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
and I was the one helping him, just the luck of the draw.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,320
And then it happened?

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,420
I've never heard a person scream like that before.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,780
What set him off?

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,060
He had this picture book, and he flipped it to a certain page.

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,960
Picture book?

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,280
[MUSIC]

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,600
(dramatic music)

20
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,540
- Nobody'd think less of you

21
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,820
Your EEG readings were normal. They didn't show anything.

22
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,880
In fact, you're the picture of health.

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,840
You know, the doctor says it's probably anemia or fatigue.

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,540
Another possibility is that you experienced some sort of shock, or so the doctor says.

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,960
By the way, he also mentioned something about a scar on your head from a major surgery.

26
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,480
I'm just giving you a hard time, but seriously, you should probably take it easy for a bit.

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,580
Oh, I almost forgot. You got some mail. This letter came for you while you were in the hospital.

28
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,900
Oh, really?

29
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,860
It's strange. They didn't put their return address.

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,920
But I didn't hear any ticking, so I think you're okay.

31
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,940
What's so funny, Johan? Come on, share the joke.

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,380
Just what did they send you, anyway?

33
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,020
Oh, it's merely a letter from the Red Hindenburg.

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,760
Huh?

35
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,780
You look pretty wholesome.

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,820
You sure you're tall enough for this ride?

37
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,360
What, are you lost, kid? Or maybe you're looking to lose it, yeah.

38
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
Yeah, if you want to learn your ABCs, I'm the perfect girl for the job. Come on.

39
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,580
You don't happen to know the Red Hindenburg, do you?

40
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,440
Huh?

41
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,600
The Red Hindenburg. I'm looking for her. She's nearby, or so I've heard.

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,420
Huh? Why are you looking for her?

43
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,140
Seriously, you must be into some pretty kinky stuff there, kid.

44
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,080
Fine, they're in the back.

45
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Need my fix. I'm coming down too hard

46
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,180
Will I find a red Hindenburg at the top of the stairs

47
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,440
(eerie music)

48
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,180
- It's open.

49
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,140
Oh good, you came.

50
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,210
Make yourself at home.

51
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,860
Ah yes, that face of yours.

52
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,080
You've such a beautiful face.

53
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,900
I saw you on TV, kid. The evening news.

54
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,620
Right next to Schuwald. Smooth one, aren't ya?

55
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,220
So now you're calling yourself the Red Hindenburg.

56
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,260
After calling yourself Margot Langer all that time?

57
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,780
And before Langer the name was blue Sophie call me whatever as long as I get paid names don't mean crap, right?

58
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,700
Johan Liebert

59
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,780
If you simply must know it's a pet name for my latest boyfriend he's waiting back there behind door number one

60
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,400
Thank you, honey

61
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,300
Don't go getting any funny ideas, sweetie

62
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,220
He's holding a big gun in his hand and he's just itching to give it a go

63
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,740
I can't see the one he's got in his pants.

64
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,680
(laughing)

65
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,960
(coughing)

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,960
I'm impressed.

67
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,740
Warming your way into old Shuvald's confidence like that?

68
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,560
You're running one hell of a scheme.

69
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,960
I'm not just saying it to be polite.

70
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,300
I remember you bringing that foreign boy,

71
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,980
saying he was Shuvald's son.

72
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,840
Who could have ever guessed the real deal would come forward?

73
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,920
Those were some pretty long odds, right?

74
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,340
Guess you knew better.

75
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,320
Poor little Edmund Farran, what a fool.

76
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,320
You practically tied the noose for him as soon as he'd served his purpose.

77
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,400
Hell, kid, it took me two years.

78
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,080
That's how long ago the real Margot Langer died,

79
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,940
and let me tell you, the timing couldn't have been better for me.

80
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,720
After she died, her name allowed me to cash in on Shuvald's guilt.

81
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:24,400
money go to waste whatever it's not like the girl was my closest friend or

82
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,960
anything she wasn't even turning tricks anymore she said she went completely

83
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,520
clean we just had a couple of drinks nothing more she probably didn't have

84
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,760
anyone else to talk to I'd get her drunk shed a few crocodile tears and suddenly

85
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,300
her life was an open book. I heard all about her fling with Shuvald and about sending his

86
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,160
bastard to an orphanage. And then the poor thing went and got herself killed. I used

87
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,380
the name Margot Langer to get Shuvald's money, and I lived happily ever after. End of story.

88
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,720
When Margot was killed, the police concluded she was the victim of a random attack. Case

89
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,520
closed. Little did they know this dead former hooker was just one measly piece in a big

90
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,260
- A gory puzzle, like Richard Brown,

91
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,480
the former police detective.

92
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,080
I can't help but feel sorry for the guy.

93
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,040
If he hadn't gotten so nosy,

94
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,720
maybe he wouldn't have felt like jumping

95
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,940
that fateful night.

96
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,080
(laughing)

97
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,140
Goodness me, what's the body count again?

98
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,500
Enough reminiscing, let's get down to why I asked you

99
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,880
Business, my dear.

100
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,300
And don't even think about squirming your way out of this one.

101
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Ain't that right, honey?

102
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,800
So name a number. I'm listening.

103
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,080
What are you, deaf?

104
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,660
Tell me, what do you think is the ultimate fear?

105
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,720
I really thought I'd already reached the darkest of the dark.

106
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,440
What the hell are you mumbling about now?

107
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,580
But then, ahead of me...

108
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,920
I beheld a darkness even greater still.

109
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,540
Wait a minute!

110
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,380
You think you can just walk away?

111
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
I'm leaving this town.

112
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,860
Shuvalp no longer amuses me.

113
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,940
Don't try to blow me off, kid!

114
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,620
It's no use.

115
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,740
How do you shoot a person who doesn't even exist?

116
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm through messing around!

117
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,220
Honey! Honey, get out here already!

118
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,720
Honey! What are you doing? Roberto, please!

119
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,720
Hello again. May I please have a balloon?

120
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,040
Here, take it and go get your fix.

121
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,260
How much longer is it going to be, Doctor?

122
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,820
Come on, he's bleeding from his head.

123
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,360
What?

124
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,020
My kid's going in first.

125
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,200
You wait your turn.

126
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,720
Quit your yowling, Brad.

127
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,840
It's just a broken bone.

128
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,640
It hurts so much.

129
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,900
Mommy.

130
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,440
You said it, fella.

131
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,420
Whine all you want.

132
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,280
There's still only one doctor here.

133
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,820
It hurts.

134
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,440
Am I right?

135
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,120
It hurts.

136
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,160
It hurts.

137
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,060
It hurts.

138
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,900
It hurts.

139
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:34,920
It hurts.

140
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,320
It hurts.

141
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,540
What do you got in that bundle of yours, huh?

142
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,020
Uh, this? It's nothing.

143
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,020
You don't happen to know if this particular doctor is good, do you, sir?

144
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,700
Ah, best of the bunch.

145
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,860
If it weren't for this doctor, all us Asians around here, we'd all be dead.

146
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,300
Especially the Vietnamese.

147
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,380
Really, you don't say.

148
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,220
Hold on, you're not Vietnamese, right?

149
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,660
No, I'm not.

150
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,940
Wait a sec, where are you going?

151
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Some of these folks are in a bad way, son. Let them go first.

152
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,400
Don't worry. I didn't come here as a patient, for what it's worth.

153
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,360
Hey, hold up! You need to wait your turn!

154
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,760
He needs to be looked at right now, Doctor!

155
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,560
My kid is first, you got that?

156
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,780
If you'd excuse me.

157
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,500
Hey, what the hell? Where do you think you're going, pal?

158
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,160
Uh, I'm sorry, Doctor. I just wanted to ask you something really fast.

159
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,580
Wait out there! How many times do I have to tell you?

160
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,020
I don't have time for this.

161
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,540
A woman. And she's...

162
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,700
- Get out of here!

163
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,600
- How old could she be?

164
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,080
- I'm in the middle of suturing this wound.

165
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,260
If anything goes wrong, it's on your head

166
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,300
for distracting me.

167
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,280
- A stab wound in the thigh.

168
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,160
It's from a knife.

169
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,800
Her stitches are neat, but...

170
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,280
I think the patient's going to need a drainage tube.

171
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,140
- I think you need to keep quiet.

172
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,260
- Otherwise, you'd better take this person

173
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,240
to a real hospital.

174
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,340
I don't know who you think you are, but this is a real hospital.

175
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,660
No, it's really not.

176
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,660
It's no hospital any more than you're a real doctor.

177
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,840
If a real hospital were an option for these people, don't you think they would have gone?

178
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,740
Most of the patients who come here are undocumented immigrants.

179
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,380
If they took their problems to one of those real hospitals,

180
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,260
they'd be sent to jail and deported to their country of origin.

181
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,780
How many people do you think I've had die right here in this room

182
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,800
It was a real hospital, wasn't a choice.

183
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,680
Save your judgment for things you actually know something about.

184
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,900
Insert the drainage tube, now.

185
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,520
The knife he was stabbed with probably wasn't very clean.

186
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,340
Unless you insert a drainage tube,

187
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,480
the wound will get infected and form an abscess.

188
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
Look, I know what I'm talking about here.

189
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,140
Okay.

190
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,020
Now, remove a few of the stitches.

191
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,420
Got it.

192
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,700
Insert that tube about five centimeters.

193
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,480
Gently now.

194
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,100
That's it. You did a good job.

195
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,700
Thank you very much. Who's the next patient?

196
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,700
You're finally awake.

197
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,520
You push yourself too hard.

198
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,260
Your patients told me you'd been treating them for two days straight without any sort

199
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,720
of break.

200
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,840
I checked on everyone's post-operative status while you were asleep.

201
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,920
How old are you, anyway?

202
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:14,820
Seventeen.

203
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,920
I never would have guessed it based on your work.

204
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,460
You've the skills of a practicing physician.

205
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,940
It just happened.

206
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,900
The doctor who used to practice out of this building disappeared and left all his equipment behind.

207
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,320
Equipment won't get you far without proper training.

208
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,380
So, where'd you learn your techniques, anyway?

209
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,280
My father. He was a doctor.

210
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,960
Is that so?

211
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,320
He had a practice in Vietnam,

212
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,760
and when he came to East Germany to study, he took me along with him.

213
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,900
He ended up staying there for keeps, even opened up his own little clinic.

214
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,200
And then the Berlin Wall came down.

215
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,120
He never had enough time to treat everybody,

216
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,180
but he tried to help out the immigrant community as best he could.

217
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,020
Until that day.

218
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,080
The day a man murdered my father, some neo-Nazi thug.

219
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Just because our skin is a different color, my father is dead.

220
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,020
I was just a kid, so eventually they sent me to an orphanage.

221
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,500
A German family adopted me soon after.

222
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,500
Turns out the only reason they took me in was to look like good Samaritans to the neighborhood.

223
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,200
We saved this poor little yellow girl. Aren't we great?

224
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,700
I ran away. Anyway, I'd been helping my father at his clinic from the start.

225
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,120
I read a lot of the medical books in his library after he was killed.

226
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,320
Someone had to carry on his mission, and who better to do it than his own daughter?

227
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,360
Step aside, I can finish up the boy's arm.

228
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,140
That wasn't so bad. Go easy on it for a while if you want it to heal right.

229
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:58,840
Okay.

230
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,480
Fine then, who's up next?

231
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,380
Most of them are treated and gone.

232
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,980
You know, you could be a top-notch doctor if you went to school.

233
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,480
This country is full of opportunities for people who want to learn.

234
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,780
Words of wisdom from a real doctor, unless I'm wrong.

235
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,900
I'm not going to close this clinic because you say so.

236
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,280
Hold on, that's not what I'm saying here.

237
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,080
I just thought that maybe you could...

238
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,140
If I leave, who's going to take care of all those people who come here for help?

239
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,360
No one, nobody else here gives a damn!

240
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,000
Listen, what I meant was...

241
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
Mommy, don't die!

242
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,980
What happened?

243
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,480
My pimp, I pissed him off.

244
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,180
He said I had a smart mouth, so he shot me!

245
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,500
Mommy! Mommy!

246
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,260
Your mom walked all the way here after being shot?

247
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,960
Mommy said if we came here, you'd be able to make her better again!

248
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,360
But she's shot!

249
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,680
Please save her! Make Mommy better! I don't want her to die!

250
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,900
I will. Now go wait out there like a good, brave boy, okay?

251
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,260
Doctor, please help her!

252
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,200
Around here, it's the prostitutes who always get shot or knifed or worse.

253
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,280
I wish there was something I could do, but I'm out of my league here.

254
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,180
We need to get her on the table. Lift up her legs.

255
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,540
No way! What do you think you're doing?

256
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,380
This woman needs to go to a real hospital!

257
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,040
She'll be dead before we ever get her to the emergency room!

258
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,960
I can't! I can't save this patient! This one's too much for me!

259
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,720
"There's always a chance, as long as the patient is still breathing, do you understand?

260
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,360
Don't ever give up hope."

261
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,480
"If the artery in her abdominal cavity had been damaged, her blood pressure would have

262
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,640
plummeted, leading to immediate shock.

263
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,660
But she was able to walk here on her own, which means her blood pressure dropped gradually.

264
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,420
She's in a state of pre-shock, which improves her odds.

265
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,920
Judging from the location of the bullet wound, there could be some damage to the spleen.

266
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,840
We can perform emergency abdominal surgery on her while transfusing blood simultaneously.

267
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,480
Alright, let's get started.

268
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,040
Pick up the scalpel.

269
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,740
"It's amazing he can sleep so soundly."

270
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,740
"I still can't believe there was no damage to the stomach, intestines, or any part of

271
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,760
the digestive tract.

272
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,640
All we had to do was remove the injured portion of the spleen and stitch her up.

273
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,980
You did a great job in there."

274
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,180
"Only because you were there with me."

275
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,800
"Mommy..."

276
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:13,660
"You know, Dr. Tenma, this place could use you."

277
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,940
"I came here because I had a question to ask."

278
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,620

Blue Sophie, also known as the Red Hindenburg.

Word on the street is you were the first person to arrive at the crime scene.

281
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,760
Are the rumors true?

282
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,460
Uh-huh.

283
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,560
Can you tell me anything about what you saw when you got there? Anything at all?

284
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,640
I got a call that somebody heard a shot, so I rushed over as fast as I could.

285
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,720
I got her in the back of the head, point blank.

286
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,100
I've seen many crime scenes, but this was different.

287
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,620
The feeling that I got when I walked into that room...

288
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,080
It wasn't a robbery. There wasn't any malice either.

289
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,120
It was simply a killing.

Keep the light shining.

Enroll in a program somewhere and study hard, okay?

You've got a real gift for this.

You'll make a fine doctor.
