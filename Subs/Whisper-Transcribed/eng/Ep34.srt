1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
He was released?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes. Johann Liebert was discharged this morning.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Wow, that was fast.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
They said he just collapsed all of a sudden.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But I guess it couldn't have been anything too serious.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, you. You come by the library a fair amount.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey, you're a librarian at the university, aren't you?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh, so they let him out already?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,880
that's a relief he gave me such a scare yesterday so you were there when he

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,600
collapsed then uh-huh he was trying to track down a book and I was the one

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,780
helping him just the luck of the draw and then it happened I've never heard a

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,320
person scream like that before what set him off he had this picture book and he

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,900
flipped it to a certain page picture book

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,340
Nobody'd think less of you for taking a few days off, you know.

19
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,980
Your EEG readings were normal.

20
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,480
They didn't show anything.

21
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,060
In fact, you're the picture of health.

22
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,920
You know, the doctor says it's probably anemia or fatigue.

23
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,840
Another possibility is that you experienced some sort of shock, or so the doctor says.

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,380
By the way, he also mentioned something about a scar on your head from a major surgery.

25
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,580
I'm just giving you a hard time, but seriously, you should probably take it easy for a bit.

26
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,440
Oh, I almost forgot.

27
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,480
You got some mail.

28
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,400
This letter came for you while you were in the hospital.

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,320
Oh, really?

30
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
It's strange.

31
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,560
They didn't put their return address, but I didn't hear any ticking, so I think you're

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:19,560
What's so funny, Johan? Come on, share the joke.

33
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Just what did they send you, anyway?

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Oh, it's merely a letter from the Red Hindenburg.

35
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Huh?

36
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,820
You look pretty wholesome. You sure you're tall enough for this ride?

37
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,380
What, are you lost, kid? Or maybe you're looking to lose it, yeah.

38
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,260
If you want to learn your ABCs, I'm the perfect girl for the job. Come on.

39
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,580
You don't happen to know the Red Hindenburg, do you?

40
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,460
Huh?

41
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,600
The Red Hindenburg. I'm looking for her. She's nearby, or so I've heard.

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,420
Huh? Why are you looking for her?

43
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,140
Seriously, you must be into some pretty kinky stuff there, kid.

44
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,100
Fine, they're in the back.

45
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:18,680
I need my fix.

46
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,520
I'm coming down too hard.

47
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Will I find a red Hindenburg at the top of the stairs?

48
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,180
It's open.

49
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,160
Oh, good, you came.

50
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,380
Make yourself at home.

51
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,860
Ah, yes, that face of yours.

52
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,080
You've such a beautiful face.

53
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,900
I saw you on TV, kid, the evening news.

54
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,340
Right next to Schuwald.

55
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,620
Smooth one, aren't you?

56
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,180
So now you're calling yourself the Red Hindenburg,

57
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,280
after calling yourself Margot Langer all that time?

58
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,260
And before Langer, the name was Blue Sophie.

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,720
Call me whatever, as long as I get paid.

60
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,640
Names don't mean crap, right, Johan Liebert?

61
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,080
If you simply must know, it's a pet name for my latest boyfriend.

62
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,080
He's waiting back there behind door number one.

63
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,220
Ain't ya, honey?

64
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:12,980
don't go getting any funny ideas sweetie he's holding a big gun in his hand and he's just

65
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,740
itching to give it a go you should see the one he's got in his pants

66
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:25,960
i'm impressed

67
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,740
warming your way into old shoe vaults confidence like that you're running one hell of a scheme

68
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm not just saying it to be polite I remember you bringing that foreign boy saying he was

69
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,600
Schuwald's son who could have ever guessed the real deal would come forward those were some

70
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:54,200
pretty long odds right guess you knew better poor little Edmund foreign what a fool you practically

71
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:01,960
tied the noose for him as soon as he'd served his purpose hell kid it took me two years that's how

72
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,940
Long ago, the real Margot Langer died, and let me tell you, the timing couldn't have been better for me.

73
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,720
After she died, her name allowed me to cash in on Shuvald's guilt.

74
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,020
No point letting that money go to waste.

75
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,720
Whatever. It's not like the girl was my closest friend or anything.

76
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,300
She wasn't even turning tricks anymore.

77
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,560
She said she went completely clean.

78
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,160
We just had a couple of drinks, nothing more.

79
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,780
She probably didn't have anyone else to talk to.

80
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,780
I'd get her drunk, shed a few crocodile tears,

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,340
and suddenly her life was an open book.

82
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,020
I heard all about her fling with Schuwald,

83
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,700
and about sending his bastard to an orphanage.

84
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,540
And then the poor thing went and got herself killed.

85
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,320
I used the name Margot Langer to get Schuwald's money,

86
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,380
and I lived happily ever after, end of story.

87
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,320
When Margot was killed, the police concluded

88
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,380
she was the victim of a random attack.

89
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,320
Case closed.

90
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,760
Little did they know this dead former hooker

91
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,480
was just one measly piece in a big, gory puzzle.

92
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,460
Like Richard Brown, the former police detective.

93
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,060
I can't help but feel sorry for the guy.

94
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,040
If he hadn't gotten so nosy,

95
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,920
maybe he wouldn't have felt like jumping that fateful night.

96
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:30,160
Goodness me, what's the body count again?

97
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,480
Enough reminiscing. Let's get down to why I asked you to come here tonight.

98
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,880
Business, my dear.

99
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,300
And don't even think about squirming your way out of this one.

100
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,760
Ain't that right, honey?

101
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,740
So name a number. I'm listening.

102
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,080
What are you, deaf?

103
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,660
Tell me, what do you think is the ultimate fear?

104
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,660
Huh?

105
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,340
I really thought I'd already reached the darkest of the dark.

106
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,440
What the hell are you mumbling about now?

107
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,440
But then, ahead of me...

108
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,940
I beheld a darkness even greater still.

109
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,540
Wait a minute!

110
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,380
You think you can just walk away?

111
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,560
I'm leaving this town.

112
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,740
You see, Shoe Vault no longer amuses me.

113
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,940
Don't try to blow me off, kid!

114
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,620
It's no use.

115
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,760
How do you shoot a person who doesn't even exist?

116
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
I'm through messing around!

117
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Honey! Honey, get out here already!

118
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Honey, what are you doing?

119
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Roberto, please!

120
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:34,720
Hello again. May I please have a balloon?

121
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Here, take it and go get your fix.

122
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,440
How much longer is it gonna be, Doctor? Come on, he's bleeding from his head!

123
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,440
What? My kid's going in first. You wait your turn.

124
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,900
Quit your yowling, Brad. It's just a broken bone.

125
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,640
It hurts so much.

126
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,880
Mommy!

127
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,440
You said it, fella. Wine all you want.

128
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,280
There's still only one doctor here.

129
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,400
Am I right?

130
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:38,520
Hey, young man, what do you got in that bundle of yours, huh?

131
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,980
Uh, this? It's nothing.

132
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,000
You don't happen to know if this particular doctor is good, do you, sir?

133
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,700
Best of the bunch.

134
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,840
If it weren't for this doctor, all us Asians around here, we'd all be dead.

135
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,260
Especially the Vietnamese.

136
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,360
Really? You don't say.

137
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
Hold on. You're not Vietnamese, right?

138
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,660
No, I'm not.

139
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,960
Wait a sec. Where are you going?

140
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,060
Some of these folks are in a bad way, son. Let them go first.

141
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Don't worry. I didn't come here as a patient for what it's worth.

142
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,360
Hey, hold up. You need to wait your turn.

143
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,780
He needs to be looked at right now, doctor!

144
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,560
My kid is first, you got that?

145
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,800
If you'd excuse me.

146
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,500
Hey, what the hell? Where do you think you're going, pal?

147
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,140
I'm sorry, Doctor. I just wanted to ask you something really fast.

148
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,560
Wait out there. How many times do I have to tell you?

149
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,040
I don't have time for this.

150
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,540
A woman. And she's...

151
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,700
Didn't you hear me? Get out of here.

152
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,640
How old could she be?

153
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,080
I'm in the middle of suturing this wound.

154
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,320
If anything goes wrong, it's on your head for distracting me.

155
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,260
A stab wound in the thigh.

156
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,160
It's from a knife.

157
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,380
Her stitches are neat, but...

158
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,280
I think the patient's going to need a drainage tube.

159
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,140
I think you need to keep quiet.

160
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,260
Otherwise, you'd better take this person to a real hospital.

161
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,260
They'll take care of it.

162
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,340
I don't know who you think you are, but this is a real hospital.

163
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,660
No, it's really not.

164
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,700
It's no hospital any more than you're a real doctor

165
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,600
If a real hospital were an option for these people

166
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,880
Don't you think they would have gone?

167
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,740
Most of the patients who come here are undocumented immigrants

168
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,400
If they took their problems to one of those real hospitals

169
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,280
They'd be sent to jail and deported to their country of origin

170
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,780
How many people do you think I've had die right here in this room

171
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,800
Because a real hospital wasn't a choice?

172
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,640
Save your judgment for things you actually know something about

173
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:46,560
insert the drainage tube now the knife he was stabbed with probably wasn't very clean

174
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,120
unless you insert a drainage tube the wound will get infected and form an abscess look i know what

175
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,900
i'm talking about here okay now remove a few of the stitches got it insert that tube about

176
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
Five centimeters. Gently now.

177
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
That's it. You did a good job.

178
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
Thank you very much. Who's the next patient?

179
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:50,700
You're finally awake.

180
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,520
You push yourself too hard.

181
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,720
Your patients told me you'd been treating them for two days straight without any sort of break.

182
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,820
I checked on everyone's post-operative status while you were asleep.

183
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,820
You know, you're pretty good at this for being underground.

184
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,900
How old are you, anyway?

185
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,600
17.

186
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,920
I never would have guessed it based on your work.

187
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,460
You have the skills of a practicing physician.

188
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,940
It just happened.

189
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,920
And the doctor who used to practice out of this building disappeared and left all his equipment behind.

190
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,320
The equipment won't get you far without proper training.

191
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,360
So, where'd you learn your techniques, anyway?

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,300
My father, he was a doctor.

193
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,960
Is that so?

194
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,760
He had a practice in Vietnam, and when he came to East Germany to study, he took me along with him.

195
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,920
He ended up staying there for keeps, even opened up his own little clinic.

196
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,200
And then the Berlin Wall came down.

197
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,160
He never had enough time to treat everybody, but he tried to help out the immigrant community as best he could.

198
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,040
Until that day

199
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,300
The day a man murdered my father

200
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,080
Some neo-nazi thug

201
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,860
Just because our skin is a different color

202
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,520
My father is dead

203
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,840
I was just a kid

204
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,040
So eventually they sent me to an orphanage

205
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,560
A German family adopted me soon after

206
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,480
Turns out the only reason they took me in was to look like good Samaritans to the neighborhood

207
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,240
We saved this poor little yellow girl, aren't we great?

208
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,740
So I ran away

209
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,700
Anyway, I'd been helping my father at his clinic from the start

210
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,140
I read a lot of the medical books in his library after he was killed

211
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,340
Someone had to carry on his mission, and who better to do it than his own daughter?

212
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,380
Step aside, I can finish up the boy's arm

213
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,500
That wasn't so bad.

214
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,160
Go easy on it for a while if you want it to heal right.

215
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,840
Okay.

216
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,480
Fine, then. Who's up next?

217
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,380
Most of them are treated and gone.

218
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,000
You know, you could be a top-notch doctor if you went to school.

219
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,480
This country is full of opportunities for people who want to learn.

220
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,800
Words of wisdom from a real doctor, unless I'm wrong.

221
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,940
I'm not going to close this clinic because you say so.

222
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,280
Hold on. That's not what I'm saying here.

223
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,080
I just thought that maybe you could...

224
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,140
If I leave, who's going to take care of all those people who come here for help?

225
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,360
No one. Nobody else here gives a damn.

226
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,040
Listen, what I meant was...

227
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,280
Mommy, don't die!

228
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,000
What happened?

229
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,480
My pimp, I pissed him off.

230
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,200
He said I had a smart mouth, so he shot me.

231
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,540
Mommy, Mommy!

232
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,260
Your mom walked all the way here after being shot?

233
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,960
Mommy said if we came here, you'd be able to make her better again.

234
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,420
But she's shot.

235
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,760
Please save her. Make Mommy better. I don't want her to die.

236
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,880
I will. Now go wait out there like a good, brave boy, okay?

237
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,240
Save my Mommy, Doctor. Please help her.

238
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,200
Around here, it's the prostitutes who always get shot or knifed or worse.

239
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,280
I wish there was something I could do, but I'm out of my league here.

240
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,180
We need to get her on the table. Lift up her legs.

241
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
No way! What do you think you're doing?

242
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,360
This woman needs to go to a real hospital!

243
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,040
She'll be dead before we ever get her to the emergency room!

244
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,280
I can't! I can't save this patient!

245
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,960
This one's too much for me!

246
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,420
A doctor never gives up!

247
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,420
There's always a chance as long as the patient is still breathing.

248
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,480
Do you understand?

249
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,380
Don't ever give up hope!

250
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,260
If the artery in her abdominal cavity had been damaged,

251
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:55,020
her blood pressure would have plummeted leading to immediate shock but she was able to walk here

252
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,500
on her own which means her blood pressure dropped gradually she's in a state of pre-shock which

253
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,340
improves her odds judging from the location of the bullet wound there could be some damage to

254
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,940
the spleen we can perform emergency abdominal surgery on her while transfusing blood simultaneously

255
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,900
all right let's get started pick up the scalp

256
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:40,680
It's amazing he can sleep so soundly.

257
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,760
I still can't believe there was no damage to the stomach, intestines, or any part of the digestive tract.

258
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,640
All we had to do was remove the injured portion of the spleen and stitch her up.

259
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,100
You did a great job in there.

260
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,200
Only because you were there with me.

261
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,620
Mommy.

262
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,540
You know, Dr. Tenma,

263
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,280
this place could use you.

264
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,320
No.

265
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:19,360
I came here because I had a question to ask

266
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,640
I spotted this article

267
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,700
Blue Sophie, also known as the Red Hindenburg

268
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,020
The word on the street is you were the first person to arrive at the crime scene

269
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,800
Are the rumors true?

270
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,500
Uh-huh

271
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,700
Can you tell me anything about what you saw when you got there?

272
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,580
Anything at all?

273
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,660
I got a call that somebody heard a shot, so I rushed over as fast as I could.

274
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,700
I got her in the back of the head, point blank.

275
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,500
She died instantly.

276
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,100
I've seen many crime scenes, but this one was different.

277
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,500
The feeling that I got when I walked into that room...

278
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,120
It wasn't a robbery. There wasn't any malice, either.

279
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,160
It was simply a killing.

280
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,140
Johan.

281
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,440
When you're in the darkness, you only sink deeper into it.

282
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,700
Keep the light shining.

283
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,760
Enroll in a program somewhere and study hard, okay?

284
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,780
You've got a real gift for this.

285
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,120
You'll make a fine doctor.

286
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,520
Hold on! Where are you going, Dr. Tenma? Please wait!

287
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,520
The darkness?

288
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,320
But you also look like someone sinking deeper into the darkness, aren't you, Dr. Tenma?

289
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,320
Please tell me that you'll come back someday. Can you promise me that?
