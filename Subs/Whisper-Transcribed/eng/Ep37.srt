00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,260
Of course!

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,280
Hey, where are you going?

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,500
Schuwalt's book donation ceremony. You wait here!

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,460

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,740
Don't follow me, Dieter! Stay here!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,720
It's Schuwald.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:36,700
Huh?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,140
I need to speak with Hans-Georg Schuwald now.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,360
Call his estate.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,680
Yes, sir.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,220
Wait.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,300
Unless I've got the date wrong,

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,100
today is his book donation ceremony

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,980
at the University of Munich library.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,300
We've got an emergency.

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,180
Huh?

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,720
I know Tenma's next target.

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,620
And it's Schuwald.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,660
Nina! Wait!

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,620
Loda! I'm so glad you came.

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,960
I tried, but the person I'm looking for...

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,180
I'm not going to find them here after all.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,880
And we were just getting to be friends, too.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,120
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,460
You're twins, right?

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,880
You gotta be! You look just like him!

28

We'll be right back.

42
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:04,300
once upon a time in a land far away there lived a nameless monster the

43
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:14,940
monster was dying to have a name so the monster made up his mind and set out on

44
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:21,760
a journey to look for one but the world was such a very large place the monster

45
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,760
They split in two and went on separate journeys.

46
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,260
One went east, the other headed west.

47
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,520
The one who went east came upon a village.

48
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,760
There was a blacksmith who lived at the village's entrance.

49
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,760
"Mr. Blacksmith, please give me your name," said the monster.

50
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,520
"I can't give you my name," replied the blacksmith.

51
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,520
"If you give me your name, I'll go inside you and make you strong," said the monster.

52
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,520
"Really?" said the blacksmith. "If you make me stronger, I'll give you my name."

53
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,520
The monster went into the blacksmith.

54
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,520
And so, the monster became Otto the blacksmith.

55
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Otto was the strongest man in town.

56
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:28,840
Then one day, he said, "Look at me! Look at me! The monster inside of me is getting bigger!"

57
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,320
Munch, munch. Chomp, chomp. Gobble, gobble. Gulp.

58
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,760
The hungry monster ate up Otto from the inside out.

59
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Once again, he was a monster without a name.

60
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:58,680
next he went into Hans the shoemaker however munch munch chomp chomp gobble

61
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,480
gobble gulp once again he went back to being a monster without a name then he

62
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:15,060
became Thomas the hunter but soon munch munch chomp chomp gobble gobble gulp

63
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,180
Back he went, to being a monster without a name.

64
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,120
The monster next went to a castle to look for a nice name.

65
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,320
He came upon a very sick boy who lived in that castle.

66
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,720
If you give me your name, I'll make you strong, said the monster.

67
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,480
The boy replied,

68
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,840
If you can make me healthy and strong, I will give you my name.

69
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,460
So the monster jumped right into the boy.

70
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,140
And the boy became full of vigor.

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,140
The king was overjoyed.

72
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,400
He announced,

73
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,740
The prince is healthy. The prince is strong.

74
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,420
The monster became quite fond of the boy's name.

75
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:16,420
He was also quite pleased with his royal life in the castle, so he controlled himself no matter how ravenous his appetite became.

76
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:26,560
Day after day, despite his growing hunger, the monster stayed put inside the boy, but finally, the hunger just became too great.

77
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,400
Look at me. Look at me, said the boy. The monster inside of me has gotten this big.

78
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,360
The boy devoured the king and all his servants.

79
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,240
Munch, munch. Chomp, chomp. Gobble, gobble. Go.

80
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:56,060
The castle was lonely now with everyone gone

81
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,760
So the boy left on a journey

82
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:05,260
He walked and walked for days

83
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:12,480
And then one day

84
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,240
The boy came upon the monster who had gone west

85
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,060
I have a name

86
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:26,040
said the boy and it's such a wonderful one at that but the monster who went west replied

87
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:35,780
who needs a name i'm perfectly happy without one after all that's what we are nameless monsters

88
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,580
the boy ate up the monster who went west

89
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:49,900
At last he had found a name, but there was no longer anyone to call him by it.

90
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,020
Such a shame, because Johan was such a wonderful name.

91
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:11,920
You've read this before, haven't you?

92
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,420
So you can recheck

93
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,700
Are you Czechoslovakian?

94
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,380
I'm not sure

95
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,880
Wait, how come you don't know for sure?

96
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,400
I was very young

97
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,080
Three or four. I think somebody read this story to me back then.

98
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,240
Who are you, really? I mean, could it be possible that you aren't actually Nina Fortner at all?

99
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,940
And if that's not who you are, then who in the hell are you?

100
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,320
I don't know.

101
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,640
What do you mean you don't know? We're talking about you!

102
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,100
So you're the one who should know, right?

103
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,820
Tell me what's going on here!

104
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,100
I need some answers!

105
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,300
Why did I get such a bad feeling when I read this picture book?

106
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,480
What does that mean, Nina?

107
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,220
A student named Foren, who claimed to be Shuvald's son, committed suicide.

108
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
The detective that Shuvald hired fell off a building and died.

109
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,380
And the prostitute who called herself Margot Langer was shot to death.

110
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,180
After reading this book, why is it now suddenly occurring to me

111
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,760
That these three horrible events are somehow linked

112
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,280
And I'm getting a weird feeling that everything is somehow connected with Johan

113
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,680
Oh man

114
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,860
Sorry, I overreacted

115
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,880
You know that person?

116
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,860
The one who collapsed after he saw the book

117
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,200
Does he really look identical to me?

118
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,280
Is he my mere image?

119
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,340
I'm talking about your friend, you know, Johan.

120
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,220
You think he looks like my twin, is that right?

121
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,040
Where is Johan right now?

122
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,480
Uh, he's at the university library attending the book donation ceremony.

123
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,040
Wait! Hold on, Nina! Wait a second! Hold on! Where are you going?

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:53,340
Everyone, please, listen carefully to what I am about to say

179
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,760
I want you all to stay calm

180
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,960
It is extremely important that you do not panic

181
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,840
As you all may know, I am blind

182
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,840
so I am unable to tell how many people have gathered together in this room tonight.

183
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,240
You need to leave the library this instant.

184
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,800
That's right. Just stay down there and be a good boy.

185
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,300
It's a real shame you won't be able to watch me do this.

186
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:50,660
get away from here go right now single file and don't push

190
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:39,440
What's happened?

191
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
There must be an electrical showing!

192
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,420
Call the fire department! Hurry!

193
00:19:52,420 --> 00:20:10,100
This wasn't in the plan.

194
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,580
I was supposed to shoot Shuval.

195
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,960
So how come there's a fire?

196
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,400
I get it.

197
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,080
You changed your mind, didn't you, Johan?

198
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,520
This is better. Much better.

199
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,580
They're running around like ants, bumping into each other, trying to get out, just like ants!

200
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,760
Amazing. You're amazing, Johan. Amazing.

201
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,060
Ah! Come and watch!

202
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,500
Doc, it's burning!

203
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,820
No! No! The books are burning!

204
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,700
Everyone is running and falling over each other,

205
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:26,820
without a thought for anyone but themselves and you sense it in the room

206
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,140
the fear

207
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:50,740
I have to shoot you won't be able to do it I have to shoot you I'm sure you can't I have

208
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:57,660
to kill you you're a doctor of medicine and you've dedicated your career to saving life

209
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Taking life is my job, and I do it well.

210
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Give it up. You can't do it.
