1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,440
I brought him back to life. That monster. I brought him back.

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,260
Of course!

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,280
Hey, where are you going?

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,500
Shuvalt's book donation ceremony! You wait here!

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,460
And Tenma's there, right?

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,600
Don't follow me, Dieter!

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,740
Stay here!

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,660
It's Schuwald.

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:36,680
Huh?

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,140
I need to speak with Hans Georg Schuwald now.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,360
Call his estate.

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,680
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,220
Wait.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,300
Unless I've got the date wrong,

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,080
today is his book donation ceremony

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,040
at the University of Munich library.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,300
We've got an emergency.

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,180
Huh?

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,720
I know Tenma's next target.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,580
And it's Schuwald.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:02,920
"Nina!"

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,960
You gotta be you look just like him

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,900
You are aren't you well aren't you?

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,500
What's this picture book cuz this is what he was looking at when he started screaming

25
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,080
(eerie music)

26
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,480
- Kira.

27
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,820
(choral music)

28
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:06,000
"Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a nameless monster. The monster was

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,240
dying to have a name.

30
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,000
So the monster made up his mind

31
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,420
and set out on a journey to look for one.

32
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,440
But the world was such a very large place,

33
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,620
the monster split in two and went on separate journeys.

34
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,280
One went east, the other

35
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,420
headed west.

36
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
The one who went east came upon a village.

37
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,560
There was a blacksmith who lived at the village's entrance.

38
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,820
"Mr. Blacksmith, please give me your name," said the monster.

39
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,300
"I can't give you my name," replied the blacksmith.

40
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,080
"If you give me your name, I'll go inside you and make you strong," said the monster.

41
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,120
"Really?" said the blacksmith. "If you make me stronger, I'll give you my name."

42
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,140
The monster went into the blacksmith.

43
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,920
And so, the monster became Otto the blacksmith.

44
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,740
Otto was the strongest man in town.

45
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,060
But then one day, he said, "Look at me! Look at me!"

46
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,860
The monster inside of me is getting bigger.

47
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,360
Munch, munch. Chomp, chomp. Gobble, gobble. Gulp.

48
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,820
The hungry monster ate up Otto from the inside out.

49
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,980
Once again, he was a monster without a name.

50
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,380
Next, he went into Hans, the shoemaker.

51
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,520
However, munch, munch, chomp, chomp, gobble, gobble, gulp.

52
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,960
Once again, he went back to being a monster without a name.

53
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,680
Then he became Thomas the Hunter.

54
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:15,040
But soon, munch, munch, chomp, chomp, gobble, gobble, gulp.

55
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,180
Back he went to being a monster without a name.

56
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,120
The monster next went to a castle to look for a nice name.

57
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,320
He came upon a very sick boy who lived in that castle.

58
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,720
"If you give me your name, I'll make you strong," said the monster.

59
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,360
The boy replied, "If you can make me healthy and strong, I will give you my name."

60
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,440
So the monster jumped right into the boy.

61
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,180
And the boy became full of vigor.

62
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,140
The king was overjoyed.

63
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,260
He announced, "The prince is healthy. The prince is strong."

64
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,420
The monster became quite fond of the boy's name.

65
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,460
He was also quite pleased with his royal life in the castle.

66
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,960
So he controlled himself no matter how ravenous his appetite became.

67
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,020
Day after day, despite his growing hunger, the monster stayed put inside the boy.

68
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,560
But finally, the hunger just became too great.

69
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,860
"Look at me! Look at me!" said the boy.

70
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,860
"The monster inside of me has gotten this big!"

71
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,340
The boy devoured the king and all his servants.

72
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,260
Munch, munch. Chomp, chomp. Gobble, gobble. Go.

73
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,740
The castle was lonely now with everyone gone, so the boy left on a journey.

74
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,260
He walked and walked for days.

75
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,680
"I have a name," said the boy. "And it's such a wonderful one, at that."

76
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,260
But the monster who went west replied, "Who needs a name? I'm perfectly happy without one."

77
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,660
After all, that's what we are. Nameless monsters.

78
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,560
The boy ate up the monster who went west.

79
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,900
At last he had found a name, but there was no longer anyone to call him by it.

80
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:56,020
Such a shame, because Johan was such a wonderful name.

81
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,900
You've read this before, haven't you?

82
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,400
So you can read Czech.

83
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,720
Are you Czechoslovakian?

84
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,380
I'm not sure.

85
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,460
Wait!

86
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,860
How come you don't know for sure?

87
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,380
I was very young.

88
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,440
Three or four.

89
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,300
I think somebody read this story to me back then.

90
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,800
Who are you, really?

91
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,220
I mean, could it be possible that you aren't actually Nina Fortner at all?

92
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,960
And if that's not who you are, then who in the hell are you?

93
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,280
I don't know.

94
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,380
What do you mean you don't know?

95
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,680
We're talking about you!

96
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,100
So you're the one who should know, right?

97
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,820
Tell me what's going on here!

98
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,100
I need some answers!

99
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,300
Why did I get such a bad feeling when I read this picture book?

100
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,480
What does that mean, Nina?

101
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,120
A student named Foran, who claimed to be Shuvald's son, committed suicide.

102
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,680
The detective that Shuvald hired fell off a building and died.

103
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,400
And the prostitute who called herself Margot Langer was shot to death.

104
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,180
After reading this book, why is it now suddenly occurring to me

105
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,860
that these three horrible events are somehow linked!

106
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,260
And I'm getting a weird feeling that everything is somehow connected with Johan!

107
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,160
Oh man...

108
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,820
Sorry, I overreacted.

109
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,840
You know that person?

110
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,860
The one who collapsed after he saw the book.

111
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,160
Does he really look identical to me?

112
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,280
Is he my mirror image?

113
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,340
I'm talking about your friend, you know, Johan.

114
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,220
You think he looks like my twin, is that right?

115
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,020
Where is Johan right now?

116
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,500
Uh, he's at the university library attending the book donation ceremony.

117
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,060
Wait! Hold on, Nina! Wait a second! Hold on! Where are you going?

118
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,440
The grand collection that the Schuwald Financial Group representative, Hans-Georg Schuwald,

119
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,720
has generously donated today to our university's Friedrich-Emmanuel Campus Library

120
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,360
is very important, comprehensive, and valuable.

121
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,420
We are very honored and extremely proud now to have in our possession

122
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,800
what you could call one of Germany's most magnificent treasures.

123
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,940
And we have a duty to preserve and protect this outstanding collection of humanity's wisdom of ages.

124
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,940
We have been entrusted to keep this for future generations.

125
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,460
[applause]

126
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,620
Next on our program is a message from the Dean of the Friedrich Emanuel Campus, Professor Steinbeck.

127
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,020
(eerie music)

128
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,460
- What?

129
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,460
Pull the trigger.

130
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,600
If I pull the trigger,

131
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,660
Everything will end.

132
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,620
Just move.

133
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,800
Doctor!

134
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,580
I don't want to die.

135
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,320
I don't want to die.

136
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,600
Doctor!

137
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,180
[GUNSHOTS]

138
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,240
Liv, please.

139
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,120
I have to do it.

140
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,660
(eerie music)

141
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,040
- Shoot him now.

142
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,220
(eerie music)

143
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,100
(gasping)

144
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,880
(eerie music)

145
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,980
And by donating such an enormous and valuable book collection to our university, he is performing

146
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,100
a great cultural service for everyone in our beloved state of Bavaria.

147
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,440
On behalf of the University of Munich, I am proud to introduce you to our benefactor.

148
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,540
At this time, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...

149
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,300
Hans-Georg Schubert!

150
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,020
Now watch how it's done.

151
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,980
Just pull the trigger.

152
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,860
Now watch how it's done.

153
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,000
Just pull the trigger.

154
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,600
It seems like it's a huge success.

155
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,860
A great number of people have gathered here.

156
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,960
I guess that Mr. Schuwald is well liked.

157
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,960
Must be nice to be him.

158
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,340
...in developing the European financial systems as well.

159
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,840
And by donating such an enormous and valuable book collection to our university,

160
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,180
he is performing a great cultural service for everyone in our beloved state of Bavaria.

161
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,480
On behalf of the University of Munich, I am proud to introduce you to our benefactor.

162
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:02,420

(audience applauding)

168
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,160
- So I am the one you're after, is that right?

169
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,260
- Would you look at all those faces out there.

170
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,080
So many people, a big crowd just to see you.

171
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,060
(eerie music)

172
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,060
- Now I understand.

173
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,520
How could you even consider this?

174
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,960
Now, now, don't spoil the fun.

175
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,400
You can watch me, if you're quiet.

176
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,360
Everyone, please, listen carefully to what I am about to say.

177
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,760
I want you all to stay calm.

178
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,940
It is extremely important that you do not panic.

179
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:06,840
As you all may know, I am blind, so I am unable to tell how many people have gathered together in this room tonight.

180
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,220
You need to leave the library this instant.

181
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,800
That's right. Just stay down there and be a good boy.

182
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,920
It's a real shame you won't be able to watch me do this.

183
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,640
Get away from here. Go, right now. Single file, and don't push.

190
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,100
- Huh?

- Stay calm!

197
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,120
- Ah, it's another fire!

198
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,460
- What do we do?

199
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,380
- Call the fire department, hurry!

200
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,300
- Help me!

- This wasn't in the plan.

203
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,600
I was supposed to shoot Shubal.

204
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,940
So how come there's a fire?

205
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,660
(laughing)

206
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,400
- I get it.

207
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,100
You changed your mind, didn't you, Johan?

208
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,520
Oh, this is better. Much better.

209
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,040
They're running around like ants,

210
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,360
bumping into each other, trying to get out.

211
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,560
Just like ants!

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,480
Amazing. You're amazing, Yohan.

214
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,780
Amazing.

217
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,500
- Come and watch, doc, it's pretty.

218
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,820
- No, no, the books are burning!

219
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:22,320
Everyone is running and falling over each other, without a thought for anyone but themselves.

220
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,940
Can you sense it in the room?

221
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,340
The fear.

222
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,900
I have to shoot.

223
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,960
You won't be able to do it.

224
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,560
I have to shoot you.

225
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sure you can't.

226
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,520
I have to kill you.

227
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,320
You're a doctor of medicine.

228
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,120
And you've dedicated your career to saving life.

229
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,200
Taking life is my job.

230
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,640
And I do it well.

231
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,040
Give it up. You can't do it.
