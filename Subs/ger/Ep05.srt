1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
was actually an accident.

2
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,620
A key feature for murder was the warrant which was not given anywhere else.

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,780
Thus, a sentence of 15 years was imprisoned.

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,980
Now then.

5
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,340
You may have your seat, Nina Faulkner.

6
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,660
Thank you, Professor.

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

10
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
OK, it's raining outside.

27
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,940
Thank you, Nina. You saved us the trouble.

28
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,420
It would fit for a carnival move.

29
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,220
You should be glad to have such a beautiful woman.

30
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,100
I'm here again, Dad.

31
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,460
Yes, right, about the carnival move.

32
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,260
Just now I saw kids who dressed up.

33
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,220
That was probably

34
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,500
because of the carnival move to San afterward.

35
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,460
Oh, you know, I would like to have dressed up as a child.

36
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,260
The three of them were really cute.

37
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,780
Would you like to?

38
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,980
Yeah, but Nena, you did that too.

39
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,580
Or maybe not, Dad.

40
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,000
Dressed up?

41
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,320
Yes, of course.

42
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,760
Let's see, where is the picture?

43
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,500
Ah, there it is.

44
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,000
You see?

45
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,760
Ah.

46
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,320
Oh.

47
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,140
Are you sure?

48
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,420
That was just a tiny breeze back home.

49
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,920
You remember?

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,480
Huh? Yeah, but was it really?

51
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,480
And so I have to wait. Wait for a spring that never comes.

52
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Hanna.

53
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Oh, Hanna, you're burying yourself again in your love sorrow.

54
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Hanna!

55
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
Hanna!

56
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,480
Hanna!

57
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Hanna!

58
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Hanna!

59
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Hanna!

60
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Hanna!

61
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
Hanna!

62
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Hanna!

63
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Hanna!

64
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Hanna!

65
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Hanna!

66
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Hanna!

67
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Hanna!

68
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Hanna!

69
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Hanna!

70
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Hanna!

71
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Hanna!

72
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Hanna!

73
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Hanna!

74
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Abort you with the most beautiful flowers,

75
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,480
On my own to satisfy this desire and I was born.

76
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,480
How lovely. Of whom this may be...

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Almost fell for it Peter.

78
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
How do you feel today Nina?

79
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Very good and this is thanks to your one and only help doctor Gai Gteg.

80
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
I'm all right.

81
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,040
Do you find it difficult to understand my question?

82
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,080
No. I...

83
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,240
The motive behind this murder

84
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,080
was in the testimony.

85
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,680
The testimony.

86
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,560
What?

87
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,280
The testimony.

88
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
The testimony.

89
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,520
Oh, Nina Fortner now knows better than this.

90
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,320
What?

91
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,700
The time before I was ten years old.

92
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,580
Where are the memories from my childhood?

93
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,620
There.

94
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,840
Yes, that was a good husband and a good person.

95
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,680
Terrible that they had to die this way.

96
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,380
What?

97
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,840
Obxy children?

98
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,840
Yes, when I think about it, there was a point.

99
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,840
I think his name was Michael. He lived with them for two years.

100
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,840
A boy, you say? I don't know if you had a boy.

101
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Yes, there was. His name was Michael. He must have been around 14.

102
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,840
A boy? Michael? Now I have to say it, maybe.

103
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,840
You're from the police, aren't you?

104
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Yes, Michael Reichmann. He was in my class, a student of mine, but I have to admit ...

105
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Well, yes. It would be impossible for me to describe him.

106
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,840
It's a little embarrassing, but I can hardly remember him.

107
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Not even whether he had friends or not.

108
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,840
And there are no more textbooks from that time.

109
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Six years ago, everything was destroyed in a big fire.

110
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Six years ago he lived here in Cologne.

111
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,840
So a boy named Michael.

112
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,840
But his real name is ...

113
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Johan, you say?

114
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Yes, that's what I used to be called.

115
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,840
What's that? Who are you?

116
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,840
But what good is it to me if I know that?

117
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,840
What I know is that you have a twin sister.

118
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
That you kill people.

119
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
I don't have to know more.

120
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,840
What am I actually doing here?

121
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,840
Twins. That's it.

122
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,840
That's with his sister.

123
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
I'll pick you up soon.

124
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Who is that?

125
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Who writes that he will pick me up soon?

126
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,840
What does that mean?

127
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,840
A child?

128
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Yes, they had one.

129
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Seven, eight years ago.

130
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Exactly, the Heiners who were murdered back then adopted a boy.

131
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
How was he, the boy?

132
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
How he was, you ask?

133
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Well, that's quite a long time ago.

134
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Besides, he lived with the Heinau family for at most a year.

135
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,840
I can't remember anything that would help you.

136
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Was there also a boy, maybe a girl here?

137
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
No, just this boy.

138
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,840
In any case, I would like to forget the terrible murder of the couple.

139
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,840
It was all so terrible for us that we almost moved.

140
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Yes.

141
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,840
I knew the boy pretty well.

142
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Huh?

143
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Come up. I'm making tea right now.

144
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Sit down.

145
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Gladly. Thank you very much.

146
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
It doesn't take long.

147
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
You should sit down.

148
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Sit down.

149
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Have a drink.

150
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
The tea is ready.

151
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Thank you.

152
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,240
You're a doctor, aren't you?

153
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,720
I know as the lad.

154
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,320
You're Doctor Thenma, am I right?

155
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
Yes.

156
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,640
He writes to you. He picks you up.

157
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,040
Who is he?

158
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,640
I don't know.

159
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,440
The emails I get don't have an altman.

160
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,720
Well, you're getting Melissa's treat.

161
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
You must believe a beautiful prince

162
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,520
will have to hang around on a cabbage patch.

163
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,520
Oh, I'm going out, I'll be right back.

164
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,960
Hey!

165
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
But the professor doesn't seem to notice him at all.

166
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
That's exactly what I mean. And you know what?

167
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,960
He's staring at you all the time, Nina.

168
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Huh?

169
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
That must be him!

170
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
What? Who?

171
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Well, who else?

172
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Of course, your prince charming.

173
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,960
I can tell you that the boy was extremely grateful to you, Dr. Tenma.

174
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,960
He said you saved his life and were more than a father to him.

175
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Can you tell me what the boy's name was?

176
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Franz. But that wasn't his real name, he said.

177
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,960
He must have trusted him very much, otherwise he certainly wouldn't have talked about it.

178
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,960
This boy suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

179
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,960
The Heilaus across the street were childless. They had adopted him.

180
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
He lived with them for about a year.

181
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Well, to be precise, 14 months.

182
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,960
From March 1987 to April 1988.

183
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Then one day he disappeared without a trace.

184
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,960
He was very intelligent and knew how to behave.

185
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Quite unusual for a twelve-year-old boy.

186
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
At least you wouldn't expect it.

187
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Did he come here to your apartment?

188
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Yes, every day.

189
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,960
I've been living alone for a long time and have liked to receive him very much.

190
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,960
He was always sitting in this chair and was diligent.

191
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Even had fashionable learning.

192
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
I taught him English and French,

193
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
and he learned extraordinarily fast.

194
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
When one day he disappeared,

195
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,960
He mastered both languages almost perfectly.

196
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
At only twelve years.

197
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Tell me, what else do you remember?

198
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Was there anything else?

199
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,960
He listened very patiently to me when I told him something.

200
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Especially on one topic.

201
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,020
The boat stopped, it went quaking,

202
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,840
and we were scared to death.

203
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,260
It took a total of 38 hours

204
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,100
until we escaped from this hell.

205
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,820
Children love stories like this,

206
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,320
but my son wasn't like this.

207
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,740
It felt like he was possessed.

208
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,820
What fascinated him most was fear.

209
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,740
Yes, the fear of death.

210
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,040
He was curious about how people interacted with death.

211
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,420
He wanted to know everything.

212
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,800
He enjoyed fear.

213
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,420
scared him to death.

214
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,260
What impression did he leave on you when he heard this story?

215
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,640
Well, his eyes were holding up, and he was smiling...

216
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,980
probably.

217
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,020
Probably?

218
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,140
I couldn't see it. I'm blind.

219
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,140
He always said.

220
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,140
Where is she?

221
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,140
She is in Heidelberg.

222
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140
See you later.

223
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,140
See you later and please drive carefully, yes?

224
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,140
Sure.

225
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,140
I have to go. See you later, dad.

226
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Good. Take care of yourself.

227
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
See you later.

228
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,140
Soon it's time.

229
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,140
I don't know.

230
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,140
That's how we decided.

231
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,140
When she turns 20, she should find out that she is not our biological daughter.

232
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,140
Hey, wait, please. I can't do this alone.

233
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,140
But you wanted to meet him.

234
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,140
We told him that you would meet here today.

235
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,140
Good luck with your dream prince on the white mold.

236
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,140
See you later.

237
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,140
Clara! Beate!

238
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,140
Thank you for your support.

239
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
Look, there he is.

240
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,140
Now it's getting exciting.

241
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,140
Hello, Nina Fortner?

242
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Yes, that's me.

243
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,140
I am... My name is Otto Rubermann.

244
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
Hello.

245
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,140
Who?

246
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,140
Who is that?

247
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,140
I know you.

248
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
But where?

249
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Who are you?

250
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,140
Who?

251
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,140
Who are you?

252
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,140
Who are you?

253
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
Nina!

254
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Nina!

255
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,140
Nina?

256
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,140
What's going on?

257
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,140
Are you okay?

258
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,140
What are you doing?

259
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,140
Nina!

260
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,140
What's going on?

261
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,140
Open your eyes!

262
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,140
Nina?

263
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,140
What happened?

264
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,140
Nina!

265
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,140
Nina!

266
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,140
Nina!

267

272
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,140
Nina!

273
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
Nina!

274
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,140

Nina!

277
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
Nina!

278
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,140
Nina!

279
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
Nina!

280
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
Nina!

281
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,140
