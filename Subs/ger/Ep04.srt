1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What do you mean, Mr. Junkers?

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The monster is coming.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Coming? What do you mean, what's coming?

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The monster is coming.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The monster is coming.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The monster?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The monster is coming.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The monster is coming.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The monster is coming.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The monster is coming.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The monster is coming.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The monster is coming.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The monster is coming.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The monster is coming.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The monster is coming.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The monster is coming.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The monster is coming.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The monster is coming.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The monster is coming.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The monster is coming.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The monster is coming.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The monster is coming.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The monster is coming.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The monster is coming.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The monster is coming.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The monster is coming.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The monster is coming.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The monster is coming.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The monster is coming.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The monster is coming.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The monster is coming.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The monster is coming.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The monster is coming.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The monster is coming.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The monster is coming.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The monster is coming.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The monster is coming.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The monster is coming.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The monster is coming.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The monster is coming.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The monster is coming.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The monster is coming.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The monster is coming.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The monster is coming.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The monster is coming.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The monster is coming.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The monster is coming.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The monster is coming.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The monster is coming.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The monster is coming.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The monster is coming.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The monster is coming.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The monster is coming.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The monster is coming.

55
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,440
Every living being is equally important.

56
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,800
And to save lives is my duty as a doctor.

57
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,240
Thank you, Doctor.

58
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,800
I think it will never be too late to start over.

59
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,880
Excuse me. I am looking for a working watch...

60
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,000
Wait a moment, what the fuck is going on here?!

61
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,120
Your date is waiting. We have to go.

62
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,200
It seems to me that it is never too late to start all over again.

63
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I want to make a statement, would it be possible, Dr. Tenma, to call in?

64
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hm?

65
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Mr. Watchtower?

66
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hello, Mr. Watchtower?

67
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Mr. Watchtower?

68
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Mr. Watchtower?

69
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Mr. Watchtower?

70
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Mr. Watchtower?

71
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Mr. Watchtower?

72
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Mr. Watchtower?

73
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Mr. Watchtower?

74
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Mr. Watchtower?

75
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Mr. Watchtower?

76
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Mr. Watchtower?

77
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Mr. Watchtower?

78
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mr. Watchtower?

79
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Mr. Watchtower?

80
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Mr. Watchtower?

81
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mr. Watchtower?

82
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Mr. Watchtower?

83
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mr. Watchtower?

84
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Mr. Watchtower?

85
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Mr. Watchtower?

86
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Mr. Watchtower?

87
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Mr. Watchtower?

88
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mr. Watchtower?

89
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mr. Watchtower?

90
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Mr. Watchtower?

91
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Mr. Watchtower?

92
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Mr. Watchtower?

93
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Mr. Watchtower?

94
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Mr. Watchtower?

95
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Mr. Watchtower?

96
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I need to get a hold of you people.

97
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,940
You little shreds.

98
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,120
You livestead of running through this poor flood right here.

99
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,460
I have been here for a much longer time, thank you!

100
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,340
Pray, dear God, so many people have passed through here today.

101
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,500
This is pre-meditated.

102
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Pray well.

103
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Oh!

104
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,920
Hey, what happened?

105
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,280
I'm gonna get help.

106
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,400
He's dead.

107
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,780
Trampolines!

108
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,580
Mr. Junkers!

109
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,660
Hurry up, Luke!

110
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
...

111
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,380
Wait, Mr. Junckers,

112
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,580
this is just like back then.

113
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,340
Toxicated bonbons and a missing patient.

114
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,740
The same as nine years ago!

115
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,300
Junkas!

116
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,960
Stay right there, Junkas!

117
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,740
I was already killed!

118
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,740
Just before my friend Fritz died, he said,

119
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,740
we worked for a cruel monster!

120
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Killing a human has no meaning to them!

121
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,740
Run!

122
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Otherwise he'll kill you too!

123
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Run away, Dr. Thelma!

124
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,740
You talk too much, Junker.

125
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
No, I don't!

126
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
Don't do that, Johan.

127
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
What does Junker know about you?

128
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,740
Nothing at all.

129
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,740
On the other hand, I know everything about you.

130
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,740
I was your doctor.

131
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
Your name is Johan Liebert

132
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,740
and you have a twin sister.

133
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
Your father's name was Michael Liebert,

134
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,740
an East German government employee.

135
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
He fled to the West in 1986

136
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,740
together with his wife and two children.

137
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
You have no chance of hiding.

138
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
Your identity is known.

139
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,740
Stop it. Be reasonable, Johan.

140
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,740
Johan, you say?

141
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,740
Yes, that's what I used to be called.

142
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,740
But I haven't been called that for a very, very long time.

143
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
What? What does that mean?

144
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Nobody knows my past.

145
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Neither the four spouses,

146
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,740
nor the Lieberts.

147
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,740
But with them, it's different.

148
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
They saved my life.

149
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,740
And I'll never forget that.

150
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,740
You're like a father to me.

151
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
Like a... like a father?

152
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,740
If it weren't for you,

153
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,740
I wouldn't be standing here right now.

154
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,740
Please don't!

155
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,740
You can't kill him!

156
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Why not?

157
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Why not?

158
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,740
Well, because...

159
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,740
What does a human life mean to you?

160
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Don't you know that a life is precious?

161
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
When I saved you,

162
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,740
I found my calling as a doctor again.

163
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,740
This one surgery nine years ago

164
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,740
made it clear to me

165
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,740
that the life of every human being is equally valuable.

166
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,740
Nobody has the right to kill another.

167
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,740
And this principle

168
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:08,740
has been firmly rooted in my heart for many years.

169
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,740
What's so funny about that?

170
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Doctor, as far as I know,

171
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,740
you were promoted after the accident.

172
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,740
That made me very happy.

173
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,740
You as head surgeon of neurosurgery.

174
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
What does all this mean?

175
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,740
The director, the head of surgery,

176
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,740
and the head of the station died back then.

177
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
Good for you, isn't it?

178
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:42,740
I think it's wonderful.

179
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,740
Was that you?

180
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,740
But that's exactly what you said.

181
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,740
That's what you wanted.

182
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,740
I could hear you clearly

183
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,740
when I came to my senses again.

184
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,740
You wanted the death of these three men.

185
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
I didn't do anything wrong.

186
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,740
People like that,

187
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,740
people like that

188
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,740
deserve to die.

189
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,740
If you're honest,

190
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:21,740
I've done you a favor.

191
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,740
