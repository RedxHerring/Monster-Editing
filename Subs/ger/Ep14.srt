1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,340
If i understand you correctly ...you threaten me.

2
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,300
But no...

3
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,200
I am only interested in the truth.

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's a bit thin to support the theory, don't you think?

5
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Did you look at the customer list of the woman?

6
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, I tried, but the data is encrypted.

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Not that easy.

8
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll do it. Give me the floppy disk.

9
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Really? But, Mr. Commissioner, you already have all your hands full.

10
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No problem, I can do it.

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have a question that I have wanted to ask you for a long time.

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And that would be?

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I have a question when you find time to sleep.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And what does that have to do with the case?

15
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Your question is irrational.

16
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And when do you want to tell him, Mother?

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Believe me, it's not that easy.

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know, he doesn't listen to me anyway.

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He's never done that before.

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But you have to tell him. It's very important.

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Be so nice and speak a little quieter.

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's sitting over there in his study.

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What? He is at home?

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Ronge, it's about the prosecution of this prostitute.

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Leave the mayor in peace.

26
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Interesting. Is there a problem?

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And whether big problems.

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
High animals from the Ministry of the Interior are annoying me.

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm very sorry. Please deal with it as usual.

30
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,580
and also he works with some quite questionable methods.

31
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,280
For example women from the red light sector are housed on the promenade..

32
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,980
..that's how they're supposed to find information pretty easily.

33
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,120
You should prefer to be careful!

34
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,560
Dad, are you sure you didn't notice I was pregnant?

35
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,460
I assume you're taking the baby's father?

36
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,920
I have a lover.

37
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,500
But that'll probably be going out of season...

38
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,640
like everything else. You'll see.

39
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,940
There.

40
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,620
I guess you are marrying the father of the child.

41
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,640
I have a beloved one, but you probably left your case as did everything else.

42
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,980
But now you know.

43
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,360
Yes.

44
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,860
Commissioner, this is the secretary speaking of Voltzmann.

45
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,660
I will tell you everything, please come.

46
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,640
I understand, see you later.

47
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,780
I'm on my way.

48
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,580
I might be off. I'll explain after.

49
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,520
Mr. Commissioner...

50
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,340
What's the matter?

51
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,240
The secretary... he killed himself.

52
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,740
Daily annoying

53
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,540
It states here, Mr. Boltzmann is innocent.

54
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,040
The secretary written that in his last note

55
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,700
Listen, Runge, Inspector Kaminski will hand over this case immediately.

56
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,320
And also the murder of Reineke and two weeks ago ...

57
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,540
... the murder of the Galand company boss.

58
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,880
And what case are you giving me?

59
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,380
I have no more case for you, Mr. Runge.

60
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,300
You'll never get rid of it.

61
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,540
If it looks like it, I'm just in time for you,

62
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,140
Dr. Avery.

63
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,140
Well?

64
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,140
Mr. Commissar, I'm sorry, you have a visitor.

65
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,480
It's that lady again, Eva Heinemann.

66
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,180
Let them in.

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,000
It will bloom beautiful in the summer.

84
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,180
Maybe, with someone like you, it would be nice.

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,220
Do you think you can make a woman like me happy?

Daddy?

87
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,060
Hey! Are you even listening?

88
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,160
Hello, dad.

89
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,980
I'm sorry. How do you like your daddy's food?

90
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,700
I knew it. You are disrespecting me.

91
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,700
It's always the same with you.

92
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,280
That´s why my mother sought another one.

93
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,620
Please excuse me.

94
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,080
Very well.

95
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,220
This is cabbage pot, sweety.

96
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,940
What if...

97
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,140
...dad also finds someone?

98
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,180
Ah, nothing. No, forget it.

99
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,800
Doesn't taste good again, today?

100
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,420
Anyway, then...

101
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,580
It isn't uncomfortable, today.

102
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,700
I see. No discomfort, then.

103
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,080
Excuise me, actually you are only responsible for the nursery.

104
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,800
No problem.

105
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,100
But my cattle helps have made few of us avoid it.

106
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,480
If i can help, just tell me.

107
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,760
Ehmm...

108
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
We two should go out for dinner tonight.

109
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Ahh well, I...

110
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,360
Why so nervous?

111
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,660
I am not used to the first class of restaurants like this.

112
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,460
If you want to fit in, you must be able to move securely in every ticket.

113
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,060
As self-confident as when you work in the garden.

114
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:15,060
That's true. When I work in the garden, I forget everything around me and just feel safe.

115
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,060
I love to design a garden according to my imagination.

116
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,060
Nowhere am I as happy as there.

117
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,060
And people who love gardens can't be bad.

118
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,060
You also said that you love your garden, Eva.

119
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,060
Does that mean I'm a good person too?

120
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,060
Yes, of course.

121
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,060
It's just...

122
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
It's what?

123
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,060
Well, I think you look lonely.

124
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,060
You do too.

125
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,060
You are lonely, aren't you?

126
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:15,060
Oh, sorry! My daughter is probably very worried about me already.

127
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,860
Kenzo...

128
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
Kenzo...

129
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,020
Who knows? Maybe we're not even just two.

130
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,000
This man in the photos ruined me.

131
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,300
I'm sorry about that. I just wanted to clean.

132
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,180
His name is Kenzo Tanma, my ex-fiancé.

133
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,580
Are you drinking again?

134
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,080
At this time?

135
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,720
Of course, why not.

136
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,960
I just came in the Federal Police Department, I wanted to talk to Inspector Runge

137
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,920
This guy's completely unavailable and he's docked me

138
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,500
When will this useless Police arrest Thänna?

139
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,520
The Federal Police Department?

140
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,440
Accuse Tänna?

141
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,600
He killed my father and then fled

142
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,440
He blamed me for being innocent, but he made stupid comments

143
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,560
My father was Chairman of a big health clinic. I had a golden future

144
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Three broken marriages only because of geh

145
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,060
From the beginning he claimed it was Johan.

146
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,560
Here, look at this.

147
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,060
This is Johan with my father.

148
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,060
Do you think this boy could kill my father?

149
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,060
And Tenma claims that it was so?

150
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060
A cheap excuse.

151
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,060
Did you show the photo to the police?

152
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,560
No, why should I?

153
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,060
It could be a proof.

154
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,560
You don't know that before.

155
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
And Tenma is the murderer.

156
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,060
He has, as the commissioner put it, two personalities.

157
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:18,560
Why are you putting the photo of your father's murderer on the air mattress?

158
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Deep in your heart you do not hope that Tenma is the murderer.

159
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Probably you still love him.

160
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,060
You have seen too many lies.

161
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,860
From all of the men in my life,

162
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,760
he just suited my heart better.

163
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,560
He is such a brilliant brain surgeon.

164
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,560
He was such a brilliant brain surgeon that he was considered a genius and enjoyed a good reputation.

165
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,560
But above all, he never contradicted me.

166
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,560
No matter what I wanted, he said yes and amen.

167
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
Yes, yes, always yes.

168
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
He always agreed with me without contradiction.

169
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,560
He should have made me the happiest woman in the world.

170
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
That's what he was for.

171
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,560
Can't I try to make you happy instead?

172
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,560
I want to conjure the most beautiful gardens for you all my life.

173
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
I'll take care of you and you'll be fine.

174
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Just because we slept together or what?

175
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
You're nothing more than a waste of time for me.

176
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
What do you think?

177
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
That was a nice little game.

178
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
And you learned something from it?

179
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Idiot.

180
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
What do you think you are?

181
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,560
That's right. You really have to be very, very lonely.

182
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Yes, and you too.

183
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,560
I'm going to celebrate Christmas with my daughter at home.

184
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Come over if you like.

185
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,560
How great, this is a real party.

186
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Did you do all of this by yourself?

187
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Yes, but I can't guarantee that it tastes good.

188
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,560
But isn't that too much for the two of us?

189
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,560
What do you think?

190
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Mom's coming back, am I right?

191
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,560
That's right, isn't it? Mom's coming today.

192
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Colette, listen.

193
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Mom's back.

194
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
Charlotte!

195
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Mom.

196
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Forgive me, my darling, forgive me.

198
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,440
Not this one, go back.

199
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,340
What do I want with mimosa or with roses,

200
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,720
with a beautiful garden?

201
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,600
What with my father?

202
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,820
From me, all that will light up if it burns.

203
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,720
Everything should burn!

204
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,600
Everything's supposed to burn

205
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,320
Welcome

206
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,620
I'm really happy that you finally listen to me, Commissioner Runge

207
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,440
I happen to have time

208
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,360
that this man is the only thing that is still interesting to me.

209
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,360
As long as he has not gotten what he deserves,

210
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,160
I will not sleep a single night in peace.
