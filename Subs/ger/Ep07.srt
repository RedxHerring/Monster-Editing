1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
No.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,840
They're gonna explain, who they really are and what they want.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,380
Besides, my name's not Anna!

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,400
My name is Nina!

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,980
No.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,840
The name was Anna,

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,280
when you was into the hospital from nine years...

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,420
And your if your brother's...

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,520
Your brother's was Joan.

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,280
My brother?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
John! Anna!

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,980
l dare speak to you.

20
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,680
Mr. Maurer, hear me!

21
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,600
Mr. Fortner, Mrs. Fortner, l'm Stenma.

22
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,920
l brought Anna, l mean Nina, home with me,

23
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,260
hello Mr. Maurer!

24
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,180
Drive and l'll contact the police.

25
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,680
The police were obviously not here.

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,300
Oh my god.

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:15,720
Come on, breathe, you must breath blev.

28
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,520
Breathe.

29
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,880
Come on.

30
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,120
Breathe.

31
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
You have to breathe.

32
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,920
Come back.

33
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,620
Come back, please.

34
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,620
Come back.

35
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,240
Mr Maucher...

36
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,320
Here's one of your favorite cigarettes.

37
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,440
Mr Maucher...

38
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,920
Kate grunting

39
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,160
Back then...

40
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,960
I killed him, didn't I?

41
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,240
I killed him, didn't I?

42
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,120
Back then...

43
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,720
Kill him,kedl

44
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,960
I killed...

45
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,200
I killed him...

46
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,500
I've killed him.

47
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,420
Nina.

48
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,680
That's impossible. I killed my brother back then.

49
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,580
And I...

50
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,500
I brought him back to life.

51
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,560
Come on.

52
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,340
The power line is still dead.

53
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,540
We need to get out of here,

54
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,100
before he gets back to get you.

55
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Dear Lord!

56
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Is this...

57
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,360
Is this man supposed to be...

58
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,080
I... I can't tell...

59
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,320
...what You're thinking...

60
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
Listen!

61
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,120
A road check.

62
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,840
We're saved.

63
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,800
Good evening. We are on the on the lookout for a fugitive runner.

64
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,040
Uh... sorry!

65
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,440
Oh come on!

66
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,160
Those are the gentlemen commissions Messner and Mueller

67
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,300
That's right. Good evening!

68
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,180
I assume you're on your way to the directive officecharges?

69
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,240
Hey, a brand new service car

70
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
Wh....what does that mean?

71
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,400
In a very short time, he looks like a pig again

72
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,900
We have no dolls for cars

73
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,260
Uh, excuse me

74
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,900
Would it be possible to get a gist of the situation

75
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,960
I think she's in pretty bad shape

76
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
What?

77
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,320
Yeah, but of course

78
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Tell me, did the two of them perhaps do something?

79
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,440
The two of them did something? No, not at all.

80
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,440
What does that mean?

81
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Are these two men real police officers?

82
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
But where does the blood come from?

83
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,440
And who put off the emergency call?

84
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
And the blue light?

85
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
What am I supposed to do?

86
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
What am I supposed to do?

87
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Everything all right, Dr. Ten Ma?

88
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,440
How?

89
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
How do you know that?

90
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I've given you my name, but you didn't mention once that I am a doctor.

91
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Where do you get this information from?

92
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,440
I understand that you don't have an appetite, but you have to drink something.

93
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

94
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

95
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

96
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

97
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

98
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

99
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

100
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

101
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

102
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

103
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

104
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

105
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

106
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

107
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

108
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

109
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

110
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

111
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

112
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

113
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

114
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

115
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

116
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

117
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
I don't know what I'm talking about

118
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

119
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

120
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,440
The man and the woman encouraged us to do so.

121
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Then my brother said,

122
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
I have a good plan.

123
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
And a little later,

124
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,440
a little later, the man and the woman were dead.

125
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,440
All these people who were good to us,

126
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,440
they all had to die.

127
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,440
But on that day I finally understood why they had to die.

128
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Then I finally understood.

129
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Is that the day when the Lieberts were killed?

130
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
My brother killed them.

131
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
He killed them both and all the others too.

132
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
He killed them all.

133
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
My brother killed them all.

134
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,440
I didn't know what to do and took the gun.

135
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
And then I aimed at my own brother.

136
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
He just laughed and said,

137
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
said to me very calmly,

138
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Don't forget to throw the gun out of the window when you've shot.

139
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,440
You have to shoot me right in the head.

140
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
I shot him in the head.

141
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
I shot him in the head.

142
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
I aimed and yet you,

143
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
you saved him.

144
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
If you hadn't saved him then,

145
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,440
then dad and mom would still be alive.

146
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Why did you save him? Why?

147
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
You wait here for me.

148
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
I'm going to the police.

149
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,440
If the men were real police officers last night,

150
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
we have to assume that Johan has connections to the police.

151
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
I absolutely have to know that.

152
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Listen to me well, Nina.

153
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Your brother will definitely be looking for you.

154
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,440
You have to be careful and hide.

155
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Eat something, drink hot coffee and sleep a little.

156
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Then you will definitely feel better soon.

157
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,440
You are alive and that's all that counts.

158
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,440
You have a future and you live.

159
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Try to look ahead.

160
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Do you already know anything about the perpetrator?

161
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Is there a connection to other murders of spouses?

162
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,440
I assure you that we are doing everything we can to solve the case.

163
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,440
But at the moment I can't give any details yet.

164
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
As far as we know, the Fortners had an adult daughter who still lived with them.

165
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Is anything known about their whereabouts?

166
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
The search for the daughter is on the rise.

167
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
What about the dead journalist Maurer?

168
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Why was he at the Fortners' house?

169
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,440
And who is the Japanese with whom Maurer worked together?

170
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,440
A Japanese? Oh, that sounds very suspicious.

171
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Yesterday evening there was another murder at Heidelberg Castle at about the same time.

172
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Is there a connection?

173
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
At Heidelberg Castle?

174
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
So he was also killed.

175
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,440
As always, we will inform you as soon as we know more about it.

176
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Excuse me, please let me through.

177
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Hello, listen!

178
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,440
Ah, if these are not our esteemed colleagues from Mannheim,

179
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
thank you for making an effort to come here.

180
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
The Commissars Messner and Müller.

181
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,440
But of course, we help where we can.

182
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Please tell us how.

183
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
How is the state of the investigation?

184
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,440
It's best if we go in to talk in peace.

185
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
How are you conducting yourself?

186
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
Are you kidding me?

187
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
You are real though.

188
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
The two Commissars are real.

189
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
No!

190
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
What should I do?

191
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Hello, this is the Heidelberg Post.

192
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440

193
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Hell is going on here in the editorial staff!

194
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
What are you saying?

195
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Who are you?

196
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,440
What's happening on corridor?

197
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:12,000

198
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,440
Nina please don't scare me it's just me it's me

199
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440

200
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,400

201
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Nina

202
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,760

203
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760

204
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Nina!

205
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760

206
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760

208
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Nina...

209
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Did he take her with him?

210
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
I shouldn't have left her alone like that.

211
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Hm.

212
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Dr. Tenma...

213
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
You're not at fault.

214
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,760
You've done all the things you did on your duty as a doctor.

215
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,520
It is not their fault.

216
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,200
Please eat the rolls, and if they can,

217
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,920
they can sleep a bit.

218
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,720
Life goes on.

219
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,240
And they will save so many of our people's lives.

220
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,600

221
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,280

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,860
Nina, tell me, what's your plan?

223
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,320
You wanna kill him again?

224
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,560

00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:23,200
