1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but it doens´t matter...

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Nina, I ask myself what is your plan ?

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Do you plan to kill him a second time ?

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,440
I got him back to life!

5
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,300
I got this monster...

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,440
...back to life!

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,660
because you are the one who brings glory to his own clinic.

35
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,280
No, I am the one who has to thank you

36
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,000
that your father allowed me to work at a German hospital

37
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,260
that entered Japan.

38
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,340
Back off, Kenso.

39
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,920
My father is the one allowing you to do anything.

40
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,520
It's just a matter of time until my father's preached in the young story.

41
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,680
Then you'll be head of surgery.

42
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,120
And just when the director is...

43
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,940
And I will be the director's wife.

44
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,300
I need a strong and successful husband on my side.

45
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,940
Are we going for a walk or are we staying here?

46
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,180
I will know.

47
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,140
Listen, the gentle lady is taking aower.

48
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,340
She' s no nasty.

49
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,060
It won't take long, I'll be back.

50
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,660
But that's just impossible.

51
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,860
You have to go on a job sometime

52
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,740
and come back sometime else.

53
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,620
And stop all the noise outside.

54
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,620
But there is a man from the police.

55
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,620
Police?

56
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,620
Long time no see, Mrs. Eva Heinemann.

57
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,620
And who are you, please?

58
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,620
I investigated your father's murder case nine years ago.

59
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,620
My name is Runge from the BKA.

60
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,620
Runge.

61
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,620
I understand.

62
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,620
You can go back, Robert.

63
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
Oh, yes.

64
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,620
I remember you well.

65
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,620
You are the one who failed to solve the case.

66
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,620
I wonder what you want from me after so long.

67
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,620
Very remarkable.

68
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,620
I would not have thought that you could hold this property after your father's death.

69
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,620
And not only that.

70
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,620
It seems to me that you could even increase your luxurious standard of living.

71
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,620
Have you come to check what I have made of my inheritance

72
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,620
and the findings from my divorces?

73
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,620
Sit down and don't be shy.

74
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,620
If you like something, you can take it home with you.

75
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,620
As long as I have enough to drink, I am satisfied.

76
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,620
Listen, I would like to show you something.

77
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,620
This tie of yours.

78
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,620
A tie?

79
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,620
Do you recognize it?

80
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,620
Well, probably not.

81
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,620
It's been a while.

82
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,620
It has a simple pattern, but if you look closely,

83
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,620
you can see that it is extremely finely woven.

84
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Best quality.

85
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,620
And what about it?

86
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,620
It was not easy to find out that this tie is nine years old.

87
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,620
But the tie comes from a business that made this model

88
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,620
in a limited number for a tribe of well-read customers.

89
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,620
And on the list of those customers, your name appears.

90
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,620
And what exactly do you want to tell me with it?

91
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,620
Mrs. Heinemann, do you remember whether you bought this tie

92
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,620
or gave it to someone?

93
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,620
Possibly it is the key to finding out about another murder.

94
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,620
A murder?

95
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,620
Oh, you know, I have given gifts to a lot of men

96
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,620
and I don't remember every single one.

97
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
In addition, all the men who talk to me

98
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,620
have only looked at my money.

99
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,620
Please try to remember.

100
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,620
As I said, I don't know.

101
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,620
In the end, they all just want my money.

102
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,620
There is no one who loves me from the bottom of his heart.

103
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
That is the sad truth.

104
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,620
In return, I have scrubbed some of them as well as I could

105
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,620
in three divorces.

106
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,620
Haha! They lost some!

107
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
Do you want something of me?

108
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
Do you want something?

109
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,620
Just say it.

110
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,620
But it may be very expensive to you.

111
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,620
We'll see you later and

112
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,620
if something comes to your mind, please notify.

113
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Next time you come by,

114
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,620
bring a bottle, alright?

115
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,780
Goodbye.

116
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,760
He's been hospitalized.

117
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,840
They want him to sleep there.

118
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,480
Eva?

119
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,320
Eva, please tell your father l didn't do anything wrong.

120
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,840
I only operated the patient who was in the line.

121
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,980
As everyone would have done regardless.

122
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,440
Eufa, please.

123
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,680
But this is...

124
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,760
your engagement ring, isn´t it?

125
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,540
Vater is right, you are an idiot.

126
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,600
Eva!

127
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,120
Good evening, Dr. Norton. What slender suit you've chosen!

128
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,120
You have nothing against your brilliant beauty, Ms. Eva.

129
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
Robert! Go get the cart ready!

130
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,000
Dr RED!

131
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
Yeah, sir!

132
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,320
But thanks to you, Doctor, I can...

133
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,320
You also fought very bravely.

134
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Thanks to your genius, I will not only be able to experience my daughter's wedding, but also the wedding of my grandchildren.

135
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,320
You are the best doctor I know.

136
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Please stay with us at this clinic for a long time.

137
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Excuse me, Dr. Tenma. There is a visitor for you.

138
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,320
I have a visitor now. Please tell him that I have something to do and send him away.

139
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
But...

140
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Eva!

141
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,320
It's been a while, Kenzo.

142
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
It is.

143
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Good.

144
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,320
A lot has happened since then.

145
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Can you hear me, Papa? Are you already asleep at this time?

146
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
I'm coming in now.

147
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Dad!

148
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,920
Yes!

149
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,440
Eva, Eva!

150
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,560
This is horrible, but you need to be strong now.

151
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,080
Leave me alone!

152
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,360
Give me back my father!

153
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,960
Give me back my father!

154
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Give me my father back!

155
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,020
Give me my father back!

156
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,980
Kenso?

157
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,760
Please hold on.

158
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,400
I made a mistake.

159
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,060
Kenso?

160
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,480
Kenso!

161
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,820
Kenzo.

162
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,620
You lost a bit of weight, didn't you?

163
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,460
Kenso.

164
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,500
I want to make things right.

165
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,180
I've used three failed marriages and divorces to understand

166
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,180
that there was only one guy that ever loved me.

167
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,600
Kenso, it was you.

168
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,640
I have to go.

169
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,440
Kenso!

170
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Just do what you want.

171
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,860
I'll tell the police it was your tie.

172
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,580
I'll tell them everything.

173
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,400
That you murdered my father and the others 9 years ago.

174
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,100
That it was your work.

175
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,760
What's he doing?

176
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,800
Look at her.

177
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,100
Take her back to Dr. Tenner

178
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,020
and make her a witness immediately.

179
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,100
But in a похожsofW flavor but will make her t

180
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,260
erroristic by the.

181
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,180
Lately, I've been hearing some peculiar rumors.

182
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,100
Not that I'll listen to anything of them.

183
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,740
Think about it for a minute.

184
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,140
Wait! Wait!

185
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,420
Dr. Tinma!

186
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,220
Hello, what is it?

187
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,740
What? The police?

188
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,740
Doctor Tenma was a suspected murderer.

189
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,400
Close all passages in that compartment

190
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,760
and don't forget the small memes.

191
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,740
Roger!

192
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,040
All right.

193
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,300
Wait, Dr. Tenma.

194
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,600
It's all going to be all right.

195
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,280
Hold on.

196
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,140
I will save you.

197
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,940
I didn't do anything wrong,

198
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,940
and I was supposed to be problematic?

199
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,980
What the Are You Then?

200
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,860
A hellish yellow demon drover?

201
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,360
These people...

202
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,860
These people...

203
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,700
deserve death!

204
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,380
I don't want to die.

205
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,640
Dr. Tenma!

206
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,060
You should have seen me die.

207
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,620
But you kept me alive.

208
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,300
Get out of here!

209
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,100
It's got to be bloody hot.
