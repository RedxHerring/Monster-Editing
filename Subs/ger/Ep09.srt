00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea,

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You were with the French Foreign Legion.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
After that, in 1979, you fought as a soldier in the war in Nicaragua.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
From 1981 to 1984, you supported the government-enemy guerrillas in Afghanistan.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In 1987, you were in Mossad's fight against radical Islamists,

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
although you played a decisive role.

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You have a lot of war experience, that's for sure, am I right, Hugo Bernhard?

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You have a lot of war experience, that's for sure, aren't I right, Hugo Bernhard?

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And anyone who performs any training with you will certainly fight very well.

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
As a combat-hungry veteran, you are indeed highly sought after as a teacher.

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I would really appreciate it if our new members could enjoy such a training.

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,160
give my employees any information.

26
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,020
I understand.

27
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,800
Actually, anyone who comes to me has to learn to shoot from scratch.

28
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,720
But I've never had anyone who's ever made one shot land.

29
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,240
Start!

30
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,640
Don't fall asleep!

31
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,020
Let's go, start!

32
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,940
Yes, yes!

33
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,720
You need to walk a little faster!

34
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,300
Faster!

35
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
Hold the tension, man.

36
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,280
Put your hand to mine.

37
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,240
I said hurry up.

38
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,420
Hah!

39
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,420
I really have to say, you jump much better than me!

40
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,280
You're still lazy, Hunchback.

41
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,080
A mountaineer.

42
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,420
He's probably looking for food for his sheep.

43
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,720
THE LAST MISSION

44
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,720
Not hungry from all the hard training you had?

45
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,700
Uh...

46
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But...

47
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,560
Money is education.

48
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,180
Yes of course.

49
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,700
To hate them all their lives.

50
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,700
That's something that happens if you deal with guns.

51
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,700
If you don't like that, you better cut them.

52
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:37,660
What's that?

53
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:48,620
Smells nice!

54
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,180
What's this?

55
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,300
It smells so good.

56
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,660
This must be real rope.

57
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,840
Da...

58
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Thank you.

59
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,600
You may now cease.

60
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,520
What does thatâ€¦

61
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,720
It is time to learn how to walk.

62
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Oh, I see.

63
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,780
Yes.

64
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,900
Very well then.

65
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,500
When you're done then you come to the amazing Madex rock behind the house

66
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,280
What .. to the amazing Madex Rock?

67
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,740
There's the shooting range

68
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,480
The shooting range

69
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
So, two shots

70
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,360
If shoot you REALLY have to press twice in a row

71
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,320
It increases the chance that they also really kill target

72
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
If they don't do it

73
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,980
Then you could pay with your life.

74
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,640
Shit shit shit shit shi-

75
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,000
What is that?

76
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,180
Super!

77
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,620
You are quite skillful in that.

78
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
Now, now, now.

79
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
And again.

80
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,420
Into position.

81
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,980
And again.

82
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

83
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

84
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

85
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

86
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

87
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

88
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

89
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

90
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

91
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

92
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

93
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

94
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

95
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

96
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

97
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
What happened?

98
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,980
There was a mountain giraffe.

99
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,000
Wait, it needs to get back in its nest.

100
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,520
Or the cub is dead.

101
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,100
It needs to go back to its mother.

102
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,340
You can just't bring it outside of the nest.

103
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,340
Come on, Jan.

104
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,840
We'll welcome it back.

105
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come

107
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,120
can be shot at a human is another question, as soon as he meets his

108
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,760
opposite, he will find out whether he knows how to deal with a weapon or

109
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:19,080
whether he cannot Hoping himself, I understand what it might empty things for you in the end

110
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,960
are ok mr bronat and you don't happen to know where he is right now

111
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,740
And again, thank you very much for everything

112
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,980
Again

113
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,920
Oh, crap!

114
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,420
You're laughing, aren't you?

115
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,920
Come on.

116
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,520
You know exactly when he just wants to stop.

117
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
I can help you.

118
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,200
Alright, you're free to go now.

119
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
This way, gentlemen.

120
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:25,960
