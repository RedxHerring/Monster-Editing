1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,100
You're gonna find her!

2
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,540
Tell me where Papa is.

3
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,000
What's going on with him, tell me?

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm going to take a picture of you.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,100
about much information on the East German government and its party.

61
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,380
The Liebertheus family and their two children look very happy.

62
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,940
They're very happy to be in West Germany where they're very well kept.

63
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,880
The family will first stay in Dusseldorf

64
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,240
and live in an apartment that's been given to them by the authorities.

65
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,060
That's what they've set.

66
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,420
l feel as though l never slept at all.

67
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,420
Don't even think about it. You have to get up, my dear.

68
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,420
The news is about you.

69
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,420
The operation was performed in the Eisler Memorial Clinic in Düsseldorf.

70
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,420
Clinic director Heinemann has just given a press conference.

71
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,420
The diagnosis of Mr. Rosenbach is subarachnoidal bleeding

72
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,420
due to a burst brain artery.

73
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,420
The operation went well and the aneurysm could be clamped down.

74
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,420
Mr. Rosenbach has a lot of fans around the world.

75
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,420
Will he be able to sing again?

76
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,420
We're doing everything in our power to get his voice back.

77
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,420
Dr. Heinemann and his team have already performed

78
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,420
numerous complicated operations.

79
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,420
With this complicated and successful operation,

80
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,420
he has once again established his reputation in medical circles.

81
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,420
I'm proud of you, Kenzo.

82
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,420
The news is not about me. It's about your father.

83
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,420
You're right about that.

84
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,420
But thanks to your excellent work in your father's team,

85
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,420
you contributed a lot to it last night.

86
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,420
My father will be very grateful to you,

87
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,420
because you are the one who helps his clinic to its good reputation.

88
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,420
No, I'm the one who should be grateful

89
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,420
that your father allows me, a Japanese,

90
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,420
to work in a German clinic.

91
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,420
Go on, Kenzo.

92
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,420
Stick to my father, then everything is possible.

93
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,420
It's just a matter of time

94
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,420
before my father becomes the head of the clinic.

95
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,420
And then you'll be the head of surgery.

96
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,420
And one day you'll be the head of the clinic.

97
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,420
And I'll be the head of the clinic's wife.

98
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,420
I need a strong and successful man by my side.

99
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,420
Are we going for a walk or are we staying here?

100
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,420
Blood pressure 128 to 64.

101
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,420
Skeleton splinter.

102
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,420
I'm mauzing down the pyramids.

103
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,420
As always this was great work, Dr. Tenma.

104
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
I thank you.

105
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,420
But you seem to be talented at the operating theater.

106
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,420
So young and already about to be the head of the clinic.

107
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,660
The hospital and the head of surgery appreciate you very much.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,280
And they have even conquered the first-name of the hospital director's daughter.

109
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,560
W-What do you want to tell me, Dr. Beker?

110
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,880
Well. Pardon me, I'm not assaulting you.

111
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,980
But politics is just running in a hospital.

112
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,780
You're aware that the head of the hospital has once used you, aren't you?

113
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,020
The success of the surgery on the opera singer....

114
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,340
was, in itself, considerly. And the press says so proudly about it.

115
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,280
If he uses you in this way it means you are really capable.

116
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,940
Please remember me when you get up.

117
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,500
I'll invite you soon for a drink.

118
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
So?

119
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,380
I want him back!

120
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,400
Give me back my man!

121
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,740
THE DOWNWIND

122
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,520
Is this the address?

123
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,520
It's the emergency call from the neighborhood.

124
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Well?

125
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,280
Oh.

126
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,280
That's nasty.

127
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,240
What in the world?

128
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Oh!

129
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,960
There's somebody!

130
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,000
There is a survivor, a girl.

131
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Two dead bodies, a man and a woman.

132
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,200
A young man is critically ill.

133
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,980
I repeat, a young man is critically ill.

134
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:38,040
The Freelancer

135
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,340
I have to go to the clinic!

136
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,840
The Freelancer

137
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,220
Headshot?

138
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,720
He's the onlyונder wounded?

139
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Yes, his parents dying.

140
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,360
It looks like a robbery.

141
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,220
Right, I'll go super-fast.

142
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,220
Have you already told your parents in Japan when you two will get married?

143
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,220
Yes, I have.

144
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,220
But it is not yet certain whether my father will come.

145
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,220
As you know, he runs a small practice all by himself.

146
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:46,220
That would be a wonderful opportunity for him to take a nice trip abroad.

147
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,220
I see that too. Your family is warmly invited.

148
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,220
Thank you very much.

149
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,220
You have already done so much for me, Mr. Director Heinemann.

150
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,220
When you came to Germany back then, I thought you were a top student.

151
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,220
And now you are actually the number one at the Eisler Memorial Clinic.

152
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,220
By the way, Kenzo.

153
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,220
You are currently dealing with the subject of

154
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,220
dangerous contractions after a subarachnoid bleeding.

155
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,220
Yes, I am creating a model for a subarachnoid bleeding in dogs.

156
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,220
I have to tell you that you will cancel your research.

157
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,220
Cancel?

158
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,220
I have long promised to give a lecture at the upcoming European Congress on Emergency Medicine.

159
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,220
And you should write me a draft for it.

160
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,220
But I worked hard for it.

161
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,220
I'm almost done with my research.

162
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,220
Maybe, but this afternoon there was an accident.

163
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
What happened today, dad?

164
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,220
A dubious organization has marched in front of the clinic.

165
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,220
They make us hot as hell because of the operation of this opera singer.

166
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,220
They accuse us of letting a Turkish patient wait in front of it while it was delivered.

167
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,220
There is a big mistake.

168
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,220
The Turkish person was operated first and everything else was a lie.

169
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,220
No doubt, our approach was completely faultless.

170
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,220
Or was it not?

171
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Yes, of course.

172
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,220
These lunatics seem to believe we doctors work out of pure available love.

173
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,020
Of course we save people's lives but on the surface we are scientists.

174
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Anyway. You will write the script for my profession.

175
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,720
I count on you, C Took, my son-in-law.

176
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,220
Thank you very much, Dr Hainemann.

177
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
D!

178
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,740
What on earth is he doing up there?

179
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,320
Oh shit!

180
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,420
Oh shit!

181
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,760
Oh shit!

182
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,000
Where is he?

183
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,640
He has just been brought in.

184
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,220
I acted on instructions from the clinic director and operated on the opera singer.

185
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,220
It wasn't in my hands.

186
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,220
Of course.

187
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,220
Some lives are worth more than others.

188
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
Give my husband back to me.

189
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,220
If you had operated on him, he would still be alive.

190
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,220
Give him back to me. I want him back.

191
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,220
Why? Why? Why?

192
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,220
Why?

193
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,220
What's wrong with you, Dr. Tenma?

194
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,220
Wait for me.

195
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,220
Another operation is waiting for me.

196
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,220
Wait, Dr. Tenma.

197
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,220
This is an instruction from the director.

198
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,220
We now have the CT of the mayor.

199
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,220
Please come with me. You have to see this.

200
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,220
Yes, right away.

201
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
Wait, Dr. Tenma.

202
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,220
Dr. Tenma.

203
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,220
Everything will be fine. Hang in there.

204
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,220
I'll save you.

205
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,220
Kill him.

206
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
Kill him.

207
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
I love you.

208
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220

I love you.

218
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
I love you.

219
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,220
I love you.

220
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
I love you.

221
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
I love you.

222
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,220
I love you.

223
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,220

I love you.

229

I love you.

230
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,220
I love you.

231
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,220
