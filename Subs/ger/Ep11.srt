1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What? You're only here because of the Liebert family?

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Then you have no interest at all.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry. I'm looking for information.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't know anything about an officer who was supposed to have fled ten years ago.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I heard that the Lieberts adopted a twin couple when they used to live here.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't know anything about that.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And the owner of the house? Can I contact him?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's not that simple.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Most of the properties and houses in the GDR used to be owned by Jews who fled from the Nazis.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The socialist government borrowed them from their owners who lived abroad or in West Germany.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The owner of this house also lives abroad. I'm sorry.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Our real estate company is from the West and has only been represented here since the fall of the wall.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We don't know what happened here before.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, may I ask? I would like to close.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But is there really no one who might remember the Lieberts?

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, yes. Many officials of the government used to live here.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But after the fall of the wall, most of them moved away.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Those from the interior ministry were in a lot of trouble.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, I remember.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
About ten houses away lives a former employee of the GDR Trade Ministry.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, that Liebertâ€¦

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He shouldn't have risked the escape to the West.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If only he had waited! The GDR would have collapsed soon.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I still can't believe that he fled to freedom and was murdered there.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Do you say that there lived a pair of twins?

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A pair of twins, eh?

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, now that you mention it, the twins that the Lieberts brought from the orphanage.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
An orphanage?

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The two children were really exciting.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The Lieberts always wanted children, but it was not granted to them.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What was the name of this orphanage?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
A good question.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Was it 511?

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, I think that was it.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The institution was called Kinderheim 511.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Kinderheim 511?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Kinderheim 511?

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Kinderheim 511

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Kinderheim 511

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Kinderheim 511

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Kinderheim 511

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Kinderheim 511

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Kinderheim 511

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Kinderheim 511

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Kinderheim 511

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Kinderheim 511

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Kinderheim 511

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Kinderheim 511

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Kinderheim 511

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Kinderheim 511

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Kinderheim 511

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Kinderheim 511

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Kinderheim 511

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Kinderheim 511

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Kinderheim 511

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Kinderheim 511

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The old Kinderheim is to be demolished and a supermarket to be built instead.

58
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,560
Stay down, or you'll get hurt again.

59
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,360
Hartmann.

60
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The development of a child depends entirely on the adults who raise it.

61
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It is our duty to help children find the right path.

62
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Only in this way can they learn to dream and realize their dreams.

63
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Your dreams?

64
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And what do you dream of, Dieter?

65
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Of football.

66
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What?

67
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I wish I had a football.

68
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I understand.

69
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Thank you for the meal.

70
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I hope you'll tell me the whole story of Johann soon.

71
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes, I'm sorry we couldn't finish our conversation.

72
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We'll catch up.

73
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll get back to you.

74
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Dieter.

75
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Excuse me.

76
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Can I come in for a moment?

77
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Mr. Hartmann?

78
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's me, Tenma.

79
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Mr. Hartmann!

80
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Mr. Hartmann! Mr. Hartmann!

81
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Is everything alright? Mr. Hartmann!

82
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Mr. Hartmann!

83
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Mr. Tenma!

84
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Dieter!

85
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But what happened?

86
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He fell. He climbed on the chair.

87
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What are you doing?

88
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Ouch! It hurts a lot!

89
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Show me where it hurts.

90
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It hurts a lot!

91
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Quick, you have to call an ambulance.

92
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes.

93
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll take a look, okay?

94
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh my God.

95
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Where did all the injuries come from?

96
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
When I press here, does it hurt?

97
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He has two broken ribs.

98
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
In addition, the left shoulder is dislocated.

99
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
How did he get so injured in a crash?

100
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The ambulance is on its way.

101
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There is no need to worry.

102
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Where did all these injuries come from?

103
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's all right.

104
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You are no longer needed here.

105
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But...

106
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Your abduction technique seems very professional to me.

107
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's almost as if you were a doctor.

108
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
No.

109
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Tenma.

110
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I knew I had heard the name before.

111
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I would say you are a doctor.

112
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The one who is wanted for murder.

113
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The injuries.

114
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Where did all these injuries come from in his body?

115
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You should get out of here as soon as possible.

116
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I didn't just call the ambulance.

117
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I also called the police.

118
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Mr. Hartmann.

119
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Tell me right now where the boy got these injuries.

120
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's none of your business.

121
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And I'm not going to let a wanted murderer tell me anything.

122
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The typical behavior of a blind criminal.

123
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's what you did to him.

124
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

125
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Don't do that.

126
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You abused the defenseless boy.

127
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Abused?

128
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Now stop it.

129
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's a bad excuse.

130
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Isn't it, Dieter?

131
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What are you going to do now?

132
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm taking the boy to a hospital.

133
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
First murder and then child abduction.

134
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Don't move.

135
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You run straight into the police's arms.

136
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You walk straight into the arms.

137
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You'll be okay.

138
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

139
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't want to go.

140
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm scared.

141
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You don't have to be afraid.

142
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The doctors will fix you up.

143
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It hurts so bad.

144
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
They used to make me look healthy.

145
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What are you saying?

146
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You've got injuries all over your body and you've never been in a hospital before?

147
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm scared.

148
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The world we live in is evil and full of evil.

149
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And that's why I have to get big and strong.

150
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Very strong.

151
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Did Mr. Hartmann tell you that?

152
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This world is black.

153
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And the future too.

154
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's not true.

155
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The world is not black.

156
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's a lie.

157
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Really?

158
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Absolutely.

159
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh, your football.

160
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I almost forgot about it.

161
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Tomorrow the world will look better again.

162
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Please forgive the delay.

163
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That doesn't matter, but it could take a while for him to be treated.

164
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The emergency room is full today.

165
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But couldn't you move him?

166
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sorry, there was a serious accident.

167
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We still have to interrogate the truck driver.

168
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
He can talk with a broken leg.

169
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He has to be treated first.

170
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Then you can take him from me.

171
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, then we'll probably have to be patient.

172
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I have to... I have to do something.

173
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Please, you have to take good care of the boy.

174
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Nurse, you must not trust anyone under any circumstances.

175
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
No matter who comes to get him.

176
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I thank you.

177
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But...

178
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Is the accident site clear?

179
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No, the streets are still closed.

180
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, my God.

181
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What am I supposed to do now?

182
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What am I supposed to do with Dieter?

183
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
He should actually go to the police.

184
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But I can't let myself be seen.

185
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The girl came down to a home in another district.

186
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't know more.

187
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Another home?

188
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's it.

189
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You want to put a child in our care?

190
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Do you know how late it is to just show up here?

191
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I know, it takes a lot, but the boy, he...

192
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm aware that the boy is being abused.

193
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But I don't even know who you are.

194
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I am... I...

195
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And we can't just take the child of a stranger here.

196
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Wait!

197
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Can you tell me if a certain Anna Liebert lived here?

198
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Anna Liebert, you say?

199
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You are friends with Anna Liebert?

200
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Then Anna was actually here?

201
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Ah, our Anna.

202
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
When was the last time you saw Anna?

203
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And is she well?

204
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes, she studies at Heidelberg University.

205
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Who would have thought?

206
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Then she must be happy.

207
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
She was such a treasure.

208
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I remember that Mr. Liebert adopted her.

209
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Together with her twin brother.

210
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What was his name again?

211
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Johan.

212
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Ah, that's right, his name was Johan.

213
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The two of them were a heart and a soul.

214
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Really bad that at first they were housed in separate homes.

215
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Before the two twins came to us,

216
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
they only had each other and were completely on their own.

217
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They had been found near the Czechoslovakian border.

218
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They held each other's hands and shivered in the cold.

219
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Mr. Liebert first wanted to take Johan with him at home,

220
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
but the boy wanted to leave his sister alone in the world for nothing,

221
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
so he ended up taking both of them.

222
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And so Anna finally found a fulfilled life.

223
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There are supposed to be terrible conditions in the children's homes of the GDR.

224
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Don't compare us to Kinderheim 511.

225
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Inge, you can't go to the toilet there.

226
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Come on, my little one.

227
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Mom!

228
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Don't cry, it's all right.

229
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You don't have to be afraid.

230
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Come on, you can do it on your own, can't you?

231
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
These children have not experienced parental love.

232
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
For the development of a child, love and affection are essential.

233
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
In many homes of the GDR, it was bad for years.

234
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Every home had a number.

235
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Here in the 47th, we made every possible effort to make it different.

236
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
To give the children a worthy home,

237
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
according to the best of our abilities.

238
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Against what the State wanted from us.

239
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I didn't want to ever be like Kinderheim 511.

240
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Officially, both the Special Homes and the Ministry of the Interior

241
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
were being staffed by the Special Homes.

242
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Do you know what gÃ¼zelich I want to do?

243
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
no

244
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The Ministry of the Interior actually kept the thread in hand.

245
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It was back when the GDR regime was operating.

246
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,840
This is the example of the DDR regime.

247
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,040
This is the experiment lab.

248
00:22:44,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

249
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I love you

250
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I love you

251
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I love you

252
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I love you

253
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I love you
