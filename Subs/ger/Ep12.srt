00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,020
Inge,

2
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,440
you're not needed in the bathroom.

3
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,520
Come on, my dear.

4
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,640
Mother!

5
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,780
Don't cry.

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,980
It's okay, you don't need to be afraid.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,400
Come on, you can do it on your own, can't you?

8
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,200
You feel better?

9
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,880

10
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,760
To never become like Kinderheim 511.

11

12
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,840
the Department of Health and the Ministry of the Interior.

13

14
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,800
No.

15

In fact, the Ministry had the final say.

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
Back then, the GDPR regime operated there.

17

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,200
Are we not really going back?

173
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,200
We're making a little detour.

174
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,200
But I don't want to go back!

175
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
No, no, I don't want to!

176
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Dieter.

177
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Dieter, listen to me.

178
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Are you a good boy?

179
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Huh?

180
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Huh?

181
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Huh?

182
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Huh?

183
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Huh?

184
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Huh?

185
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Huh?

186
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Huh?

187
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Huh?

188
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Huh?

189
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Huh?

190
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Huh?

191
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Huh?

192
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Huh?

193
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Huh?

194
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
What did you do?

195
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,200
I told you not to trust anyone until I'm back.

196
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
But why?

197
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
This man is the caretaker of the boy.

198
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
And he was very friendly and very outgoing.

199
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Much friendlier than you.

200
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Excuse me.

201
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
But the man, he took the boy ...

202
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,200
You should know that the boy went with him voluntarily.

203
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Dieter!

204
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Dieter!

205
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Dieter!

206
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Dieter!

207
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Dieter!

208
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Dieter!

209
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Dieter!

210
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Dieter!

211
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Dieter!

212
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Dieter!

213
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Dieter!

214
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Dieter!

215
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Dieter!

216
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Dieter!

217
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Dieter!

218
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Dieter?

219
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Dieter?

220
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
It's not here.

221
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Hartmann's office.

222
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Yes, but it's always the same place.

223
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Where is this place?

224
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I don't know.

225
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
I don't know.

226
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
I don't know.

227
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I don't know.

228
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
I don't know.

229
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
I don't know.

230
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
I don't know.

231
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I don't know.

232
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
I don't know.

233
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
I don't know.

234
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
I don't know.

235
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I don't know.

236
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Where is this place?

237
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Johan.

238
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,200
But who is the man standing next to him?

239
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Of course.

240
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,200
The photos were all taken in the Kinderheim 511.

241
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Both the old photos and the new photos.

242
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,200
All people who stayed in the Kinderheim at the time have died.

243
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Teachers and orphans massacred themselves.

244
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Dieter.

245
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
He doesn't have it.

246
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Dieter.

247
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Dieter.

248
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Dieter.

249
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Dieter.

250
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Dieter.

251
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Dieter.

252
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Dieter.

253
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Dieter.

254
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Dieter.

255
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Dieter.

256
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Dieter.

257
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Dieter.

258
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Dieter.

259
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Dieter.

260
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Dieter!

261
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Dieter!

262
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Wait, Dieter. I'll be right with you.

263
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,240
Go up here and look.

264
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,140
Just look up and see.

265
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,440
I asked you, saying,

266
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Well, yes.

267
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Why aren't you like John?

268
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Why can't you be like him?

269
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Tell me why!

270
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Stop it, Hartmann!

271
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
If you hurt him again, I'll shoot!

272
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Get out of here!

273
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
This is none of your business.

274
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Get out of here!

275
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Peter, come downstairs with me.

276
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Dr. Tenmar.

277
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
You're looking for John?

278
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Did I hear that right?

279
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,440
I'm wondering what you expect of him.

280
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Do you really think that you can just turn him off?

281
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Well, never mind.

282
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,440
But I'm going to give you one more tip.

283
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,280
This means if only you promise to disappear and leave us alone.

284
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,920
Search for General Wolf.

285
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,680
He was the first to discover Johann's talent.

286
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,400
Find him. He should be alive.

287
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,920
Is this the boy in the photo? In your working room?

288
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,920
The one who is standing in front of the orphanage with Johan?

289
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Yes, he brought Johan here.

290
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
He definitely knows more than I do.

291
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
And now they are disappearing.

292
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Do you hear me, Dieter?

293
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
If you want to come down to me, then get up.

294
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
You can decide freely.

295
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Don't be afraid.

296
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,920
As soon as Hartmann puts his finger on the trigger of the rifle, I'll shoot.

297
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Dieter!

298
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
You decide that alone.

299
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
That's your decision alone.

300
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
You can't separate from me at all, can you?

301
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Or do you really want to do that, Dieter?

302
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,920
After all, you are my son and I am your father.

303
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Do you understand now, Dr. Hartmann?

304
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Do you understand now, Dr. Tenma?

305
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
So, disappear!

306
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Dieter, don't!

307
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Yes, very good.

308
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Everything is fine.

309
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Come down.

310
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
To me.

311
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
To me.

312
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
What is this?

313
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Dieter, come back, my boy!

314
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Dieter, please come back!

315
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Dieter, can you really do it without me surviving?

316
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Dieter, stay!

317
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Stop it, Hartmann, or I'll shoot!

318
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
I love you, my boy!

319
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Dieter!

320
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,920
You know the world is dark and the future is pitch black.

321
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,920
Mr. Tenma told me that tomorrow everything will be better.

322
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Don't leave me!

323
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
Be brave, little one.

324
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Don't be afraid.

325
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Dieter!

326
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Dieter!

327
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Dieter!

328
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,920
It's impossible, I can't take you with me!

329
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,900
I can't take you with me!

330
00:22:36,920 --> 00:23:06,920
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

331
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:15,720
I love you
