1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Embark

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,800
Blood pressure 120 to 80

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,220
Pulse 92

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,240
Thats good

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,160
I'll remove the bullet from the carrier

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,620
That ball is outside.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,080
The ball has been successfully removed.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,940
Yes, but it's too early to breathe.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,240
Now we need to take care of the damaged

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,540
vessel doors!

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,180
Of course!

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,940
Tie up the problemrats!

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Immediately!

14
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,240
I need some sleep.

15
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,880
The death of the Liebert couple...

16
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,360
in the comfort of a local disc quarters...

17
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,980
has left people on the ground.

18
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,440
There is sign of the house has been searched.

19
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,120
They don't know whether it's a crime...

20
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,760
by political nature...

21
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,180
but an investigation continues.

22
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,700
The Lieberts' twins have survived.

23
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,860
The young man suffered a headshot,

24
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,520
but is capable of surgery.

25
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,380
But he's not fully conscious yet...

26
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:18,380
killed

27
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,380
In other words.

28
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,380
The Eisler Memorial has secured its place as the leading medical

29
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,380
institution in our country

30
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,780
You, being such esteemed colleagues,

31
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,380
have foretold it with the excellent skill

32
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,080
for which I would like to thank you.

33
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,880
Regrettably, the mayor failed to arrive

34
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
at our clinic yesterday.

35
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,080
But, as usual, we did everything

36
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,380
that was in our power to do so.

37
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,380
The public won't appreciate

38
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,180
this incident,

39
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,380
so I would now like to ask Doctor Beuer and Dr Eisen

40
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,380
for their appropriate applause for doing everything

41
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,380
to save the mayor's life.

42
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,380
Ahaha, I was reading your article last week.

43
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Very good!

44
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,380
Please continue your research, my boy.

45
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,380
Right?

46
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:56,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

47
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:26,380
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

48
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:56,380
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

49
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:05,260
an operation is not a single performance but teamwork with only combined forces

50
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,660
we are able to save the lives of people

51
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:14,880
we

52
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,760
have

53
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
You're right. You're an idiot.

54
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Eva!

55
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,060
Good evening Dr. Norden. What a nice suit?

56
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,760
Nothing against your radiant beauty, Miss Eva.

57
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,400
THE FALL OF THE DREAM

58
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,440
Strange story, isn't it?

59
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,400
I read Heinemann's article as a coincidence...

60
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,200
...and so I came to Germany.

61
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,840
I wanted to be trained to be a director.

62
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,000
Dr. Greenblatt can't save lives.

63
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,600
Some lives are worth more than others.

64
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,840
Nonsense. Every life is equally valuable.

65
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,680
I didn't do anything wrong,

66
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,300
and I was supposed to be problematic?

67
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,340
Then what are you?

68
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,440
A doctor?

69
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,760
A devil with money ировать out of Hell?

70
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
People like you...

71
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
People like you...

72
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,180
deserve to die.

73
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:38,800
However, what your name is you are already aware of, am I right?

74
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,960
Your name is Anna Liebert, remember?

75
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,960
that both parents have lost and are now completely on their own.

76
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,960
That obviously stirs people to tears.

77
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,960
As long as no one pays for the immense treatment costs,

78
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,960
you are nothing more than annoying patients for the clinic.

79
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,960
But gentlemen, this kind of press is exactly what we need.

80
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Huh?

81
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,960
This is a free advertising campaign for our clinic.

82
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,960
That alone makes the children of considerable value to us.

83
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Or do you see it differently?

84
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
Yes, no, of course.

85
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
We have to use it for our purposes.

86
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Release a joint photo of the twins to be published in the press.

87
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Of course.

88
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Requests of this kind have already come several times from the press itself.

89
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
What are you waiting for?

90
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,960
A photo that shows the two of them together in the loving care of our clinic

91
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,960
how they bravely fight back in their lives.

92
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,960
But the treating doctor says it's too early for a meeting of the two siblings.

93
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Who is this doctor?

94
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
This is Dr. Tenma.

95
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Take him away.

96
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
What?

97
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,960
This man should not have a position in which he stands in the limelight.

98
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Dr. Tenma will be dismissed.

99
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Yes, sir.

100
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,960
A heart-warming gift from the citizens.

101
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Would you like some, too?

102
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Yes, thank you very much.

103
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,960
How are you today, Mrs. Hankel?

104
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
I'm very well, Dr. Tenma.

105
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,960
I don't even know how to thank you.

106
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
I think we can pull the strings soon.

107
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Then you can finally go home again.

108
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Can I really go home again?

109
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Yes, but you have to, as I have explained to you, absolutely.

110
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Of course, I will do that.

111
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,960
prescribe Mrs. Hankel an antiepileptic and a blood pressure-lowering agent.

112
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,960
Please hold on.

113
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
What happened?

114
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Dr. Tenma.

115
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,960
We brought her to her brother's room.

116
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Then she started screaming terribly and then ...

117
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Brought to her brother?

118
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Dr. Tenma.

119
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Bring Anna to her room.

120
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Yes, sir.

121
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Dr. Beuer, what does this circus mean?

122
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
What's the camera for?

123
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Well, we wanted to capture the twins' moving reunion

124
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
photographically for the press.

125
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
With whose permission did you do that?

126
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
The treating doctor, that's me.

127
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
You know that.

128
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
That was once.

129
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,960
You were dismissed from the case.

130
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
I'll take care of it for you.

131
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,960
And in my opinion, it is completely unthinkable to bring the two together.

132
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
How can you ...

133
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
How can you put the children on display like that?

134
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
An instruction from the director of the clinic.

135
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,960
And I do not advise you to make the same mistake again.

136
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
I was the one who saved the boy.

137
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,960
And I have the duty to protect him until he is healthy again.

138
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
How interesting.

139
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Look at the boy.

140
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
He hardly saw his sister.

141
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
He hardly saw his sister.

142
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Already he stretched out his hand and began to cry.

143
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,960
He regained consciousness and showed a completely normal reaction.

144
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,960
The operation was a complete success.

145
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,960
You did a good job, but that's it.

146
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,960
And now make sure you get out of here, Dr. Tenma.

147
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Damn shit.

148
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Is this supposed to be a joke?

149
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,960
I think you want to make fun of me, don't you?

150
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Instructions from the director that I don't laugh.

151
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,960
These fuckers all think about money and career.

152
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Money and career.

153
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Damn shit.

154
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
I...

155
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
I...

156
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,960
I didn't do anything wrong.

157
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Hello, I'm back, Dad.

158
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,600
Hello, I'm back, Papa!

159
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,380
Where are you, Papa, are you in your room?

160
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,280
Excuse me, ship, are you still in a meeting this late?

161
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,940
Huh?

162
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,980
Are you listening, dad?

163
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,980
Is it your alarm clock?

164
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
I'm coming inside.

165
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,680
People like that deserve to be killed...

166
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,200
I thought we had all died!

167
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,940
Such people

168
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,820
deserve to be death.
