1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Mr. Maurer, could it be that you haven't showered again?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It can't go on like this.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You promised to take a shower at least every two days.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Do you remember?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's good. Take care of yourself.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A visitor is waiting for you at the reception.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going home now.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So you have to take care of him yourself, Mr. Maurer.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A visitor? Now at this time?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He hasn't showered in a long time either.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
At least he smells just as uncomfortable as you do.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What you don't say.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, let's see.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There are good reasons why I don't have time to shower.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Without me, this lousy place would no longer exist.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is unique and alone to thank the dear Maurer.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But that doesn't interest anyone.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
As always.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Good evening. What gives me the honor?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Good evening. My name is Tenma.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm here because I need your help.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
My goodness. You really look taken in.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, so. So you're a doctor.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Difficult to imagine.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Whatever, doctor.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let me summarize your story again.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You are of the opinion that there will be more victims in this murder series.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And here in Heidelberg, at least you suspect that.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A middle-aged couple who has an adoptive daughter

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the girl turns 20, the perpetrator comes and gets her.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And on this occasion, he will kill the parents.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You don't know the adoptive parents or the girl.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And you don't have an address either.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you ask me, that's pure paranoia, doctor.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's not funny. You have to believe me. Please.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's nonsense.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
A story like this is not even worthy of a Drip-Class 덮 기본 sweetie.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I didn't come here to deliver a story to you.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The twins left the clinic at the time.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But until they finally showed up again,

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
endless six months had passed.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And what do you conclude?

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, I guess sooner or later it swallowed them both up.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
To Heidelberg.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
As you say it yourself. You suspect it.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I suspect you were adopted by the couple

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
where the sister lives today.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
the boy will probably lead the couple away again after a short time

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,300
In fact, he even admitted that he hasn't emailed you any of those enchanting emails.

50
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,080
Oh yes?

51
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,160
The trigger for your inability was a young man you saw at their back?

52
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,520
Yes...

53
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,900
Please describe this man.

54
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,140
I find it hard to describe... I sålo saw him for a short time...

55
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,820
What about his first impression? How did you sense him?

56
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,000
I felt a great longing deep inside.

57
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,480
Ah.

58
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,460
But, well, no, I don't know how to call it, but...

59
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,640
But?

60
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,400
Like...

61
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,800
Calm down Nina.

62
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,440
Don't overdo it.

63
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,640
The real evil!

64
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,440
I can't quite put it into words but...

65
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,560
The most important thing is not to force yourself, but to look ahead calmly.

66
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,820
Yes…

67
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,080
Do not worry.

68
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,560
Do sports, then your worries and anxieties about sweating will pass.

69
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,740
Mr. Maurer, did you stay again at this time?

70
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,780
Yes…

71
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Have you interredted this worker in the archive and let him work?

72
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,480
This man in the archive?

73
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,820
He said, after you visited him and asked him what he was going to do about it,

74
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,660
he'd have let you do it.

75
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,560
That idiot is still here?

76
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,420
Damn it.

77
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,800
Hey, listen. It's lighten...

78
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,280
Hello.

79
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,460
Are you alright?

80
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,640
Hey.

81
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Yes, the sweater is finally ready.

82
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Do you remember how cute and small her sweaters were back then?

83
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Do you really want to tell our Nina?

84
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Tell her that she is not our biological daughter?

85
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
We can leave it as it is.

86
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
You are right.

87
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,480
It is not necessary to tell her.

88
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Nina is and remains our daughter.

89
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
I'm home!

90
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Hello darling.

91
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,480
Ahh… am I hungry?!

92
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
There is no problem with just looking forward.

93
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Yes. I will do this. Dr. Geidel is right.

94
00:10:51,480 --> 00:11:02,620
Tomorrow, on your birthday I'll meet you at 7 o'clock at Heidelberg Castle.

95
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,260
Tomorrow at Heidelberg Castle!

96
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:14,860
Rhéa really has enough to do and I've been foraging through this mountain of rubbish with

97
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,860
all of you for 2 days.

98
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,940
You should finally give up.

99
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,100
Listen, Doctor.

100
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,040
Agreed, only accepted.

101
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,980
I would actually try to get my wife back.

102
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,980
Do you really think he'd come back?

103
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Yeah, if you quit smoking.

104
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Huh?

105
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,740
The devil himself was on the scene here.

106
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,400
If the offender were to walk over the path here one day,

107
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,860
I'd kill him without refraining any fear.

108
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,520
Neckarstrasse 16.

109
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,200
That's the place.

110
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,520
Good evening, excuse the late intervention.

111
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,360
I must say I met some...

112
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,860
How do you call these people though?

113
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,200
Turkeys, chickens, and loincloths.

114
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,540
These are architectural terms.

115
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,820
They recognize magic,

116
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,920
Bunuvaras,

117
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,920
above an upsidedown không defendândôrâuis,

118
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,800
and that means

119
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,780
The woman had a cake standing in the hallway. A birthday cake.

120
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,780
Huh?

121
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,280
Nine years ago, you took a twin as hostage!

122
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,540
The girl is still living with you, right?

123
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,780
Please go!

124
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,560
We have raised Nina as our legitimate daughter!

125
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,220
Please don't destroy our peaceful life!

126
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,860
Get out of here!

127
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,860
Leave us alone!

128
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,660
About nine years ago, you took these twins hostage.

129
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,240
The boy had a surgical scar on his head

130
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,760
and the girl lost her memory.

131
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,220
That's right, right?

132
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,400
Listen, Mr. Fordner, we've got to notify the police immediately.

133
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,280
Your daughter's life is in danger. Do you copy?

134
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,780
But, Mr. Morlow...

135
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,660
H-How can I help you?

136
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,340
We need to speak to your daughter immediately.

137
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,300
No, that won't do. She's not home right now.

138
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,720
delicious. Not home. Where is she?

139
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Probably at Heidelberg castle.

140
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,860
She said she's meeting a friend there today.

141
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,020
Lend me your cart, please.

142
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,320
One moment. First, we have to give the police some respect.

143
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,640
We don't have time to explain-

144
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,820
Quick, my keys!

145
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,280
I understand. Go and I'll explain to the police.

146
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,000
Thank you, sir.

147
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
One more thing, Doc.

148
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,960
Britney, watch your head.

149
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,680
As I said, he is an ice cold target.

150
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,480
Just look after yourself!

151
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,960
Yes, Mr Mauer!

152
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,960
Try to come back alive,

153
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,000
and then I'll stop smoking

154
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,340
how I think a quack hospician has.

155
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,500
Your wife will be happy then.

156
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,100
So, how am I just supposed to tell the police that?

157
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,760
Is our daughter really in danger? What's going on?

158
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,720
Please, tell me what happened.

159
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,960
Do not worry, I need your phone quickly.

160
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,220
Did Nina poop something?

161
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,280
What do you know? Please explain it to us.

162
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,220
Calm down.

163
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,600
That's not possible.

164
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,700
The line's dead.

165
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,780
ANAMNESIS

166
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I hope you´re alright, Anna.

167
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,240
He should have been here ages ago. It´s already seven.

168
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,840
So this was all just a prank, and I fell for it.

169
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,520
I´ll get to work.

170
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
No! You won't.

171
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
You'll wait here.

172
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
You're not going anywhere.

173
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:19,900
Who are you?

174
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
I was hired.

175
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
You're Nina Fortner, am I right?

176
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Do you remember me?

177
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
I'm Dr. Tenma, the doctor.

178
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,700
I'm glad you're doing well.

179
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
Anna...

180
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Dr. Tenma...

181
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Let's go. I'll take you home.

182
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Are you...

183
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
the prince on the white mold?

184
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
What do you want here?

185
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,700
You're bothering me.

186
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
You shouldn't be here.

187
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,700
Only she should wait here.

188
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
That's what he said.

189
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
The girl stays here.

190
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Otherwise...

191
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
I won't get any money!

192
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,700
He said no one would come!

193
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Damn it!

194
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Are you hurt?

195
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
No, just a little surprised.

196
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Do you have anything to cut?

197
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Anything?

198
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
Yes.

199
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Who asked you to do this?

200
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,700
I don't know!

201
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,700
And when did this guy want to be here?

202
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,700
No idea. He didn't say that.

203
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,700
He just said he had something important to do.

204
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Oh my god.

205
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
At your place?

206
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Let's go home.

207
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
We have to go home as soon as possible.

208
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
But why?

209
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
I'll tell you later.

210
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Now we have to go.

211
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Quick, Anna!

212
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Anna?

213
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Hurry!

214
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Damn it!

215
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,700
The rope is too tight!

216
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
Now you tell me right now

217
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,700
who you are and what you want?!

218
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Besides, my name is not Anna,

219
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
it's Nina.

220
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
No.

221
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
When you came to the hospital nine years ago,

222
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
your name was Anna.

223
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
And your.

224
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
And your brother,

225
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
your brother was called John.

226
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
My brother.

227
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
I told you.

228
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,700
I want his brother.

229
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
And his sister,

230
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
his wife,

231
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
and his grandson.

232
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
I want them.
