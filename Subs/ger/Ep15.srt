1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,600
Let us pray.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to take a picture of you and then I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,840
going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take

4
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:16,760
a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you

5
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:27,400
and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take a picture of you and I'm going to take

6
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Hey, that's against the rules! You're not the goalie!

7
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
What do the rules matter to me, you little bum?

8
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Better tell me where I can find him.

9
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Find? Who?

10
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
You, not so stupid. Tenma.

11
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Oh, Tenma. He's got something to do.

12
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,400
He's looking for a man. And you should watch out for me for a long time.

13
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,400
What? Me? I'm supposed to watch out for you, you little toad?

14
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Is this supposed to be a joke?

15
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Of course not. I can't stand children.

16
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
That damn Tenma.

17
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
I had already written him off.

18
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
And then all of a sudden he shows up with this beam.

19
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
As a doctor for the underworld, he could have made a huge profit.

20
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,400
That idiot has no idea what he's done.

21
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Pass!

22
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Find?

23
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
You, not so stupid. Tenma.

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Oh, Tenma. He's got something to do.

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
He's looking for a man. And you should watch out for me for a long time.

26
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,400
What? Me? I'm supposed to watch out for you, you little toad?

27
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Great header.

28
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Damn. What's that supposed to be, you little toad?

29
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Hey!

30
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I told you, handball is forbidden.

31
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
There's a yellow card.

32
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
I don't care about that. You'd better keep your big mouth shut.

33
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
You'd even get a red card for that.

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Shut up!

35
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Come on!

36
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Why are you so late?

37
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Suspended because of suspicion of drug abuse.

38
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I have to admit, I was surprised when I came across the article.

39
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,400
I advise you to sit down.

40
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,400
I pointed a gun at you under the coat.

41
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
What do you want from me?

42
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,400
I want to know from you what you did 10 months ago in Heidelberg.

43
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,400
And what's more important, who enumerated you.

44
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I don't know what you mean.

45
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,400
When you were arseulted. You killed the wretch Fortnoy and Mourer, the journalist.

46
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,400
No, I didn't. I was on duty, you know.

47
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,400
It was MÃ¼ller, the guy who killed everyone.

48
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Of course, you killed him.

49
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Yes, of course.

50
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
He asked us for a lot of cash. A lot of money.

51
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,760
You're still in love with me, aren't you darling?

52
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,040
Why do you just keep staring at me, huh?

53
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,040
Is that the girl who wants to baby sit?

54
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,880
Y-yes...

55
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,220
Alright. Follow me.

56
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,700
Come on, let's go!

57
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:52,220
HOTEL

58
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,480
Please, wait a second.

59
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Put your eye there and wait.

60
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,940
No, right on top of it, right in the middle.

61
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,020
That's good.

62
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,020
Do you remember this song?

63
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,620
It's got such a little rhythm that it makes you automatically dance,

64
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,240
my dear Nina Fortnas.

65
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,320
What's going on here?

66
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,660
And what happened?

67
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,620
This country needs a new leader.

68
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,440
Just like our protector The Hitlers wanted.

69
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,500
And the girl is the right bait.

70
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,260
No way.

71
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,840
Oh crap.

72
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,260
...Oh dear.

73
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,840
What is it, Uncle Heckel?

74
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,640
This whole neighborhood is now in Turkish hands.

75
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,240
...that must be an imitation.

76
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,440
What? That can't be.

77
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,040
Feel this fabric! This is more than a 100% handmade silk!

78
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,620
That's artificial fiber, but he will be my 100 marks.

79
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,200
And I'm sorry, Huck.

80
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,460
A good joke? Not at all.

81
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,080
The previous owner, a German man, ...

82
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,820
will give me at least 10,000 marks.

83
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,740
Then take your carpet and go to him.

84
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,860
Yes, and afterwards you want to have one indeed!

85
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,900
After all, the carpet is real.

86
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,780
If you want to see a real carpet, look at this one here!

87
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,360
A Hareki silkcarpet, high quality.

88
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,500
Come closer...

89
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,300
...and see how fine it was knitted.

90
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,720
150,000 marks!

91
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
That's definitely not a fraud.

92
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
What kind of businessman are you,

93
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
who doesn't recognize that my carpet is real?

94
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Come on, Dieter. Let's go.

95
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Great. And now? I'm hungry.

96
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
A real silk carpet.

97
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Huh?

98
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
The carpet in there is quality work.

99
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
And that for 150,000?

100
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
With a little bit of skill,

101
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
I could sell it for 800,000.

102
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
It doesn't matter now. Let's eat something.

103
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Shut up.

104
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
If I get this carpet in my hands,

105
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
you can eat as much as you want.

106
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
And how do you want to do that?

107
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
That with the carpet?

108
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Let that be my concern.

109
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Why are you looking so angry?

110
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
So you're a thief.

111
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Huh? What?

112
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Not so loud, you rascal.

113
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Wait a minute. Not so fast.

114
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Where are you going?

115
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
No, I'm sorry. I have no interest.

116
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
No, you don't. What are you talking about?

117
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
As Asian as you look,

118
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
it's dangerous for you to walk in there.

119
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
The shop is a meeting point of the right.

120
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
But you're Turkish, aren't you?

121
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Isn't it dangerous for you to work there?

122
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Are you crazy?

123
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
I'm not going to shop in a hole like that.

124
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
A good friend of mine

125
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
was dragged in there by the weird guys.

126
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
She knew about a secret.

127
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
That was her doom.

128
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
A secret?

129
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
I don't know the details,

130
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
but I have to find a way

131
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
to get her out of there as soon as possible,

132
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
otherwise it's too late.

133
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
A friend of mine is in there, too.

134
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
What does she look like?

135
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
A slim, young girl with long, blonde hair?

136
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Good question.

137
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
I don't know what hair color she has now.

138
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Maybe your friend was taken in a car earlier.

139
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Where did he go?

140
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
I don't know.

141
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
But Baby was with her,

142
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
so maybe she went to his villa.

143
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Baby? What car was that?

144
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
What color?

145
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
A deep red Mercedes-Benz.

146
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Thank you. I have to find that car

147
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
as soon as possible.

148
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Wait. You have to help me

149
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
get my friend out of there.

150
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
I beg you.

151
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
She has a little child at home.

152
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
You have to help us.

153
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Please.

154
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Help!

155
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Look at him.

156
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
He seems to be still alive.

157
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
There we are.

158
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Before you go in,

159
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
please give me your gun.

160
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Good.

161
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
You will be expected.

162
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Thank you.

163
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Please find yourself a seat.

164
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
So you are the girl

165
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
who brought Baby here.

166
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Look at me when I talk to you.

167
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Oh, how pretty you are,

168
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
you are without a doubt

169
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Johann's twin sister.

170
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
My name is Professor Giedritz.

171
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
The man you see

172
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
in the photo next to Johann

173
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
is General Wolf.

174
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
He, me and two others

175
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
founded our organization

176
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
a long time ago.

177
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Can I offer you

178
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
some fruit?

179
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
I beg you.

180
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Bring me to Johann.

181
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
You have to be patient.

182
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
I'm sure he'll come here

183
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
as soon as he finds out

184
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
that you're here.

185
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
He needs you.

186
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
He needs his sister.

187
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Then they don't know

188
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
where he could be.

189
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
And more importantly,

190
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
we need him.

191
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Do you know

192
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
why Hitler could become

193
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
so successful and powerful?

194
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
He was a smart businessman

195
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
and knew how to control

196
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
three areas of central importance.

197
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
These included the banks,

198
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
the arms industry

199
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
and, of course, the military.

200
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Johann is best injured

201
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
in all these areas.

202
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
If you see this differently,

203
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
you may speak calmly.

204
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
I want to know what they're up to with Johann.

205
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Unconditionally,

206
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
the key to Hitler's power

207
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
and success was his unique charisma.

208
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Hitler failed

209
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
at the training test

210
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
at the art academy

211
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
and could only rescue him

212
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
during his Republic period.

213
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
His charisma was only

214
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
to be noticed

215
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,260
after he had already

216
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,220
surpassed thirty years of age.

217
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,220
John will find out, and he will want to see you.

218
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,220
I would would advise you to not try an escape.

219
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,220
You sit in a boat with us, so now.

220
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,220
No worries, I will not escape.

221
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,220
I will wait for John.

222
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,720
You always will.

223
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,220
Please, eat some fruit with me.

224
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,220
You're not looking for Johan, are you?

225
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
If so, what for?

226
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
I want to know where Nina is.

227
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,220
I just explained who's asking the questions here.

228
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,220
What are you going to do with her?

229
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
I'm asking the questions here.

230
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,220
Nina is a very important guest for us.

231
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,220
On the contrary to you, you little piece of shit.

232
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,220
That means she's fine, right?

233
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,220
At the moment, yes.

234
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,220
To be honest, she's a big danger.

235
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
She may look like an angel,

236
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,220
but we know she wants to kill Johan.

237
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,220
We would have to pull such a person off the road by now.

238
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,660
You are going to use her

239
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,220
as a bait for Johan.

240
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,220
Are you anything but cruel.

241
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,220
What are you going to do with Nina?

242
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
Again, no questions.

243
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,220
Poor breed like you have no right

244
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,660
to ask us any questions.

245
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,220
Just your plain cheekiness

246
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,220
should do you,

247
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,240
all those troublesome pills

248
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,900
Tomorrow evening the sky will be beautifully bright.

249
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,820
John, if I stay here, I will see John.

250
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,700
Yeah.

251
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,220
You will see him.

252
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,280
And you will see me.

253
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Hello, who is there?

254
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Please help me.

255
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Tell me where you are.

256
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
On the second floor.

257
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Can you maybe tell me who you are?

258
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Where are you from?

259
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
I am from Turkey.

260
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
They want to kill me.

261
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
I have to get out of here.

262
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Please help me.

263
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Please help me.

264
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Please help me.

265
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Please help me.

266
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
I have to get out of here.

267
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Please help me.

268
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
So these men locked you up here?

269
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Please help me.

270
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,280
The problem is that I have to stay here at all costs.

271
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
You have to help me.

272
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
I have to warn the others.

273
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
Otherwise they will all die.

274
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
And my son too.

275
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Tomorrow we will throw a small welcome party for Johan.

276
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Very soon only we will live in this world.

277
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
The men race.

278
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
And no one else.

279
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
The rest can and should burn quietly.

280
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
I heard about your devilish plan.

281
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
Tomorrow evening they want to burn everything.

282
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
They want to attack the Turkish quarter.

283
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
It should burn.

284
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Everything should die.

285
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Help me.

286
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
You have to help me.

287
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
