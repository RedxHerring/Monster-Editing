1
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,100
Huh?

2
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,800
That's my lucky charm. You got that?

3
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You wanted to know something about the murder in this villa, didn't you?

4
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Well, yes. Coincidentally, I saw the perpetrator.

5
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What are you saying?

6
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You saw him?

7
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you want to know?

8
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What did the perpetrator look like? Was it a blond man around 20? Come on, tell me.

9
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
How do you know that?

10
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's not important. Tell me something about the perpetrator.

11
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When we become partners, I'll tell you everything.

12
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is where the guy lives, on the second floor.

13
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'd be interested in how you know.

14
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I scoped the villa fee of this person all month.

15
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
When I was finally ready to get started, this guy showed up.

16
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I looked through the window and saw the two corpses lying on the ground.

17
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I thought I could poison him and make some money, so I followed him.

18
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, your innocence has been proven in this case.

19
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I guess we can call the police or whatever you want.

20
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,520
and that's basically where I handled all unnecessary risks.

21
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,540
Hello.

22
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's pretty hot again today, isn't it?

23
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Listen, I'm looking for someone.

24
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hey, Doctor, are you in there?

25
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hello, Doctor?

26
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What did I say? He has a gun.

27
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
As a child, I often went for a walk with my mother.

28
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We ran through sunflower fields on beautiful summer days like this.

29
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But that's no longer possible. My mother has been dead for a while now.

30
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Could it be that you were commissioned by someone to commit murder with this weapon?

31
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Was it perhaps a man?

32
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What? A man? A man, yes. One day he approached me in a bar.

33
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Was the man blond and about 20 years old?

34
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh, yes. And he had a beautiful smile.

35
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
His name was Erich.

36
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This time he called himself Erich.

37
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Erich and I often met and became good friends.

38
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He invited me to his house, to the house ...

39
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
the villa of the deputy Springer.

40
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So he lived in this villa?

41
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes, he said you had picked him up about a year ago and treated him like your own son.

42
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait a minute, I've been watching the villa for a month. I haven't seen such a guy.

43
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You have been very nice people.

44
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In the photo, I am seen with the spouse Springer.

45
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But one thing I could not forgive him.

46
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Huh?

47
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Right in front of your property was a bed with sunflowers.

48
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And he just destroyed them, just so they could build the driveway to the house.

49
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I told him that this was a very bad thing to do.

50
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And Erich was of my opinion.

51
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And that's why you killed her? Because of sunflowers?

52
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Besides, Erich told me that Springer had a lover.

53
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
An affair.

54
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He literally said to me,

55
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I no longer want to be part of the Springer family.

56
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Not a single day.

57
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You have become a stranger to me. I no longer belong to you.

58
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Then he asked me for a favor.

59
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He asked me to eliminate the spouse Springer.

60
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Having a lover is a sin.

61
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
My mother was also in love with someone.

62
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That was bad for me.

63
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry. This has a different meaning.

64
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Maybe you know where the safe is?

65
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Sure, it's in the office.

66
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Alright.

67
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Doctor, I'll try to moisturizing there.

68
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Did you know that you can erase your past?

69
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If you do not like it, you can simply drag it out.

70
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That's my story.

71
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If I may ask you to leave now.

72
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh yes, exactly.

73
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You are Dr. Tenma, aren't you?

74
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He left you a message.

75
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You can find it in the workroom of the villa.

76
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You should definitely take a look at it.

77
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He knew exactly that you would appear here one day.

78
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I still remember Erich telling me...

79
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Your fate is already decided.

80
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Good luck.

81
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Doctor!

82
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I told you.

83
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You don't have him around?

84
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh. Did he kill himself?

85
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What a nonsense.

86
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,340
There's an unpleasant cold shower on your back.

87
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,880
Mm?

88
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,600
Mm?

89
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,160
What's that?

90
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,700
Why are you shivering, Doctor?

91
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,980
If you want it back, get the job done.

92
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,280
Take the money, and come to the bar on Tidewalk St.

93
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,060
Now, start making money and have fun!

94
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,260
Amazing. This is real bomb business.

95
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,060
And the money I got in advance will powers up my drug-specialty.

96
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,200
Attorney. I brought the doctor.

97
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Soon our people will come and save you.

98
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Nobody's coming.

99
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,700
Believe me, they won't come.

100
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Nobody, I can feel it.

101
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
Stop the bleeding right now!

102
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Come on, do it!

103
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Or I'll shoot you!

104
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
I'll kill you!

105
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
I don't want to die.

106
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
I don't want to die.

107
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
I don't want to die.

108
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
I don't want to die.

109
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Are you afraid?

110
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Are you afraid to die?

111
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
That's how you all died.

112
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
All twelve you killed,

113
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
that's how they all died.

114
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
That's how it is when you kill people.

115
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,700
Disinfectant and scissors.

116
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,700
You'll have that.

117
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
With an arterial bleeding,

118
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,700
the low blood pressure puts her in shock.

119
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,700
I press the injured artery with my fingers.

120
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
The wound must be sewn.

121
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
I need a needle and thread.

122
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
But we don't have that.

123
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
Well, then a tacker.

124
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
What? A tacker?

125
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
Hurry up!

126
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
Yes!

127
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Done.

128
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Huh?

129
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
What are you doing?

130
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
That was just the first aid.

131
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
He has to go to a hospital.

132
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
A hospital? No way!

133
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,700
That's not possible.

134
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Put him back right now,

135
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
or I'll shoot you!

136
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Shoot me if you want.

137
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
But if you shoot me,

138
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
you'll have to bring him to the hospital.

139
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Let me down here

140
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
and then flee.

141
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Go away.

142
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,700
I'll struggle to get my way.

143
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:43,720
I'm convinced that everyone deserves a chance.

144
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,920
The police are coming.

145
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Stay alive.

146
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,160
You are...

147
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,340
You are an excellent doctor.

148
00:21:52,340 --> 00:22:01,600
Well, what about all the bills?

149
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,020
Hey, Doctor!

150
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,020
Hey, doc! Don't tell me you just left, once I've treated him.

151
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,020
Say something, doctor.

152
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,020
... guard.' market'.

153
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,020
But, to our surprise, we immediately found the killer.

154
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,020
We are not a welfare organisation, are we.

155
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
Do you hear me?

156
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,020
Do you hear?

157
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:26,020
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

158
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,020
I love you

159
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
I love you

160
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
I love you

161
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
I love you

162
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,020
I love you

163
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,020
I love you

164
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
I love you

165
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,020
I love you

166
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,020
I love you

167
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
I love you

168
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
I love you

169
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
I love you

170
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
I love you

171
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
I love you
