00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247

00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,055

00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,855
Christopher

00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
I brought your brother back to life

14
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
We're getting out of here

15
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727

00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
We're just going to have a quick look around

20
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Good Lord

21
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
This is horrible

22
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447

23
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007

00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
Well that's a relief

25
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
Backup should arrive very soon

26
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,015
They'll take care of the crime scene and will take you over to headquarters for questioning so we can file a report on this

27
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,159
So are you the daughter of the victims

28
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,351
I'm sorry for your loss

29
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
I'm assuming neither of you saw the intruder

30
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
To think something like that could happen in such a peaceful.

31
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
Pardon my asking sir but where do you come from are you Chinese and no sir I'm Japanese my name is

00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
Okay you Japanese yeah well seems to me you're quite a ways from home

33
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
You're all right now it's going to be

34
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:10,751
Okay

00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:17,151
Sorry but can you tell me

36
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
Officer the police station remember but I don't understand

37
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,951
Smtown yeah but we're from the station in Manheim the next town over

00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,351
Why are they taking us so far yeah we're

00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
Almost there just another 15 minutes or so

40

He said they got a call they came

41
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
I got a call but who could have caught the phone

42
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
No no Sirens when they first came and

43
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
They took us away before making sure the backup arrived at the scene but

44
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
Dispatches that look real

45
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
It can't be

46
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
Could these men have

47
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,351
Excuse me

48
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:53,151
These trick question

49
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783

We're searching for a hit-and-run suspect so please be alert excuse me it's you

51
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,327
Well if it isn't detective Messner detective Mueller good evening

00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
Are you two on your way back to the station

53
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
I'm sure we'll get it banged up soon enough

54
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
Yeah we really give our rides a workout

55
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
Excuse me Detective

56
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,759
She's not feeling so well back here can she get some fresh air for a minute

57
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
Oh

58
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,343
Sure you go ahead

59
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,535
Detective what's up I just doing some kind of trouble

60
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,607
Not at all it's nothing don't worry

61
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
Going on here

62
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Who could have called them

63
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
Are Sirens weren't even on

64
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
What should we do

65
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
Hey what's wrong doctor Tenma are you two okay

66
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
How do you know who I am

67
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
I gave you my name but I never told you not once that I would the doctor tell me how did you know that

68
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
I found a grocery store nearby

69
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,303
I also got you some dry clothes

70
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
There's bread sausage and cheese

71
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
I filled this thermos of hot coffee too

72
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,359
You probably don't have much of an appetite but you really should eat

73
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
You're shivering

74
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
You should change out of those wet clothes

75
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
A lot of people were dead

76
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
My brother and I

77
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Walking

78
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
It was like

79
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
Alone in the world

80
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
Where were you when all of this happened can you remember anything else

81
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
We crossed the border

82
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
Uncle and auntie help.

83
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
They were so kind to us

84
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
And my brother said

85
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
I have a good plan

86
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Soon after that

87
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
And my dear auntie were both dead

88
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
Anyone who has ever good to us died

89
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
Without fail

90
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
Awesome

91
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
But then one day

92
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,447
One day I discovered the reason why

93
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
Rainy day

94
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,383
I'm talking about the incident with mr. and mrs. Libra

95
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
My brother did it he shut them

96
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Brother

97
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Murdered

98
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,231
My brother

99
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
So I picked up the gun with both my hands

100
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
And that night I aimed it right at my brother

101
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
And that's when he said

102
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,991
Can you shoot me make sure that you throw the gun out the window

103
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
And he told me to aim for his head

104
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
Like head

105
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
I aim for his head like he told me

106
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
Why did you save him

107
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,895
If you had anything to Mom and Dad would still be alive

108
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
Stay here I'm going to the police

109
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
If those detectives last night were real

110
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
Jeans with some members of the police force are linked to Johan if so we can't just

111
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Wait here like this

112
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:48,479
Nina I need you to listen to me I know that Johann is going to come after you if anyone comes look

113
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
Just hide

114
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,695
Why don't you have some food drink some hot coffee and then try to get a couple hours of rest

115
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,535
One step at a time and that's how we'll get through all this

116
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,607
Your life

117
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:10,239
Future future

118
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
Were there any clues left by the Killer is there any connection to the serial murders throughout

119
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:23,039
Like I said we're doing everything we can to investigate this case but I can't make

120
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:29,439
Any comments or talk about details

121
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:35,839
Timer she presumed that is what we're trying to figure out her whereabouts why was that newspaper reporter with them

122
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:41,727
One question please man who is over here

123
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
Who is he he sounds suspicious

124
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,687
Quick question Chief is this murder at all related to the one that took place at Heidelberg Castle around the same time

125
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
So he was able to

126
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
That's all for now will release additional details in due time please let me through

127
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
Excuse me sir

128
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567

Please come inside that way we'll be able to speak freely

133
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,959
Those guys were with the police there actual cops

134
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
I do

135
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
Hello Heidelberg post

136
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:58,527
What I can't hear you were really busy in here

137
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:04,927
Just hold on

138
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:11,327
I'm bringing an important witness to your office 5

139
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,959
But you must not tell the police

140
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,591
If I can't trust the police then the newspaper is my only option

141
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
Only they can help me on that now

142
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Mr. Miller

143
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,023
I'm sorry but you just can't come in here without permission

144
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
He's right besides

145
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:49,215
The bka is only working on the serial murders of the middle-aged couples all that you're going to find in this room is material for the murder at the

146
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Castle inspector

147
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
Sir

148
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Please forgive me

149
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:01,759
I was just a bit curious what the crime you're investigating in this one happened at the same time Detective

150
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
I mean it couldn't have been the same murderer

151
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
So icy

152
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
It appears that this man had been tied up

153
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,255
You didn't happen to find a rope or anything nearby did you

154
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
No

155
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,631
Seems the body's already been untied by the time the police arrived on the scene

156
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
Nicey

157
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
Yes

158
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
There are four possible routes of Escape From The Scene he also had to stay well out of sight

159
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
How crowded was the area where you come out and how much light was there

160
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,903
Here it is

161
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,303
Nina's me I'm back Nina she can come out now

162
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Oh no

Moon

164
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Where are you

165
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
He came for you

166
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
I never should have left you here all of them

167
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,159
Dr. tena

168
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,024
I don't blame you for saving my brother's life anymore

169
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
You did what you had to do is a doctor

170
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
It wasn't your fault

171
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,192
Please eat the sandwiches

172
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Get some rest too

173
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Please leave on

174
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,200
And continue to save as many people as you are able to

175
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Nina Fortner

176
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Nina

177
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
Are you planning to do

178
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,872
Are you going to kill your brother second time

179
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
I did it I brought him back to life that monster

180
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:21,440
It was me

181
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
To

182
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,984
And slowly you come

183
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
