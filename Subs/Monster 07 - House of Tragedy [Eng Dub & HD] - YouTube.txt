You're shivering
You should change out of those wet clothes
A lot of people were dead
My brother and I
Walking
It was like
Alone in the world
Where were you when all of this happened can you remember anything else
We crossed the border
Uncle and auntie help.
They were so kind to us
And my brother said
I have a good plan
Soon after that
And my dear auntie were both dead
Anyone who has ever good to us died
Without fail
Awesome
But then one day
One day I discovered the reason why
Rainy day
I'm talking about the incident with mr. and mrs. Libra
My brother did it he shut them
Brother
Murdered
My brother
So I picked up the gun with both my hands
And that night I aimed it right at my brother
And that's when he said
Can you shoot me make sure that you throw the gun out the window
And he told me to aim for his head
Like head
I aim for his head like he told me
Why did you save him
If you had anything to Mom and Dad would still be alive
Stay here I'm going to the police

I mean it couldn't have been the same murderer
So icy
It appears that this man had been tied up
You didn't happen to find a rope or anything nearby did you
No
Seems the body's already been untied by the time the police arrived on the scene
