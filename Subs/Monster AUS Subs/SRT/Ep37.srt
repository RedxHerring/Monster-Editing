1
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:10,189
<i>I.. .brought him back to life.</i>

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,598
<i>I.. .brought back that monster.</i>

3
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:21,134
This is it.

4
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:25,376
Did you figure something out?!

5
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:28,207
Schuwald's
book donation ceremony!

6
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:31,452
Is Tenma there?!

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,245
Dieter, wait here!

8
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:36,156
Don't follow me!

9
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:41,886
Schuwald!

10
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:43,089
Huh?

11
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:46,061
I want to meet
Hans Georg Schuwald.

12
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:47,735
Contact him!

13
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:48,662
Okay.

14
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:53,875
Oh... Wait, today he's at
the book donation ceremony

15
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:56,001
at the University of Munich Library.

16
00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:58,644
We need an emergency
deployment there immediately.

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,606
Huh?

18
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:03,848
Tenma is after...Schuwald.

19
00:01:08,022 --> 00:01:09,183
Nina!

20
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:16,458
Lotte, you came!

21
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:19,600
Sorry.

22
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,826
I looked all over the place,

23
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:24,338
but I couldn't find
the person I was looking for.

24
00:01:24,872 --> 00:01:26,465
We had just become friends.

25
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:27,866
It's unfortunate, but...

26
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:32,008
Could it be that you're twins?!

27
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:34,882
Aren't you?

28
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:36,250
Aren't you?

29
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:38,875
What is this picture book?!

30
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:41,751
When he saw this,
he suddenly collapsed!

31
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:45,292
Picture...book...

32
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:26,533
Kill...

33
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:05,561
<i>Once upon a time' in a land far away
there lived a nameless monster.</i>

34
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:14,304
<i>The monster was dying
to have a name.</i>

35
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:21,113
<i>So the monster set out
on a journey to find one.</i>

36
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:25,682
<i>But the world was
such a very large place'</i>

37
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:30,815
<i>so the monster split into two
and went on their way</i>

38
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:33,549
<i>One monster went east.</i>

39
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:36,555
<i>The other went west.</i>

40
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:41,867
<i>The monster who went east
found a village.</i>

41
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:46,706
<i>At the village's entrance'
there lived a blacksmith.</i>

42
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:51,511
<i>"Mr. Blacksmith' give me your name' "
said the monster.</i>

43
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:54,481
<i>"I can't give you my name' "
the blacksmith replied.</i>

44
00:04:55,783 --> 00:05:01,449
<i>"In return for giving me your name'
I'll go inside of you and make you strong."</i>

45
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,990
<i>"Really? If you make me strong'
I'll give you my name."</i>

46
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:14,126
<i>The monster went
inside the blacksmith.</i>

47
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:19,029
<i>Thus' the monster became'
Otto the blacksmith.</i>

48
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:24,639
<i>Otto the blacksmith was
the strongest man in the village.</i>

49
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,506
<i>But then one day..</i>

50
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,216
<i>"Look at me. Look at me."</i>

51
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:33,888
<i>"The monster inside me has
gotten this big' " he said.</i>

52
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,356
<i>Munch-munch' chomp-chomp'
gobble-gobble' gulp.</i>

53
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:47,226
<i>The hungry monster ate up Otto
from the inside out.</i>

54
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,129
<i>Once again' he was
a monster without a name.</i>

55
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:58,312
<i>When he went inside
Hans the shoemaker, however...</i>

56
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:05,782
<i>Munch-munch' chomp-chomp'
gobble-gobble' gulp.</i>

57
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:10,349
<i>The monster was
nameless once again.</i>

58
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:14,089
<i>When he went inside
Thomas the hunter, but...</i>

59
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:20,127
<i>Munch-munch' chomp-chomp'
gobble-gobble' gulp.</i>

60
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,029
<i>The monster was
nameless once again.</i>

61
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:30,442
<i>The monster went to a castle
to find a nice name.</i>

62
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:39,877
<i>Inside the castle
lived a sick boy.</i>

63
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,449
<i>"If you give me your name'
I'll make you strong."</i>

64
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,528
<i>"If you can heal my illness
and make me strong' "</i>

65
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:50,587
<i>"I will give you my name"</i>

66
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,528
<i>The monster went
inside the boy</i>

67
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:01,700
<i>The boy became full of vigor.</i>

68
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:04,304
<i>The king was overjoyed.</i>

69
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:08,978
<i>"The prince is healthy
The prince is healthy "</i>

70
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:17,220
<i>The monster liked the boy's name.
He also liked living in the castle.</i>

71
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:21,623
<i>So he restrained himself
even though he was hungry</i>

72
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:26,825
<i>Day after day he would be terribly
hungry. but he restrained himself.</i>

73
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,995
<i>But the hunger became
just too great.</i>

74
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,741
<i>'Look at me. Look at me. '</i>

75
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:38,176
<i>'The monster inside me has
gotten this big' ' said the boy</i>

76
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:44,674
<i>The boy devoured the king
and all his servants.</i>

77
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:55,259
<i>Munch-munch' chomp-chomp'
gobble-gobble' gulp.</i>

78
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:03,530
<i>Everyone was gone'
so the boy went on a journey</i>

79
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:11,375
<i>He walked for days and days.</i>

80
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:21,650
<i>One day the boy came upon
the monster who had gone west.</i>

81
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:27,753
<i>"I have a name.
It's a wonderful name' " said the boy.</i>

82
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:30,923
<i>The monster who
went west replied'</i>

83
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:36,335
<i>"I don't need a name.
I'm perfectly happy without one."</i>

84
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:41,074
<i>"After all' that's what we are–
nameless monsters."</i>

85
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,377
<i>The boy ate up the monster
who went west.</i>

86
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:51,682
<i>At last he had found a name'</i>

87
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,148
<i>but there was no longer anyone
around to call him by it.</i>

88
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:59,423
<i>Such a shame' because Johan
was such a wonderful name.</i>

89
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,741
You know about this picture book,
don't you?

90
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,579
Can you read Czech?
Are you Czech?

91
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,253
I don't know.

92
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,557
You don't know?

93
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:31,124
Long ago...

94
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:36,888
I think someone read it
to me long ago.

95
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:43,730
Who are you?
Are you really Nina Fortner?

96
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,807
Answer me honestly.

97
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:48,902
Who in the world are you?

98
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:55,082
I don't know.

99
00:09:57,618 --> 00:10:00,178
You don't know?
We're talking about you!

100
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:02,881
You should know!

101
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,891
Answer me.
Tell me what's going on.

102
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:11,288
Why did you get a bad feeling
when you read this picture book?

103
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:15,734
A student named Fahren who claimed
to be Schuwald's son committed suicide.

104
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:18,963
The detective that Schuwald hired
fell off a building and died.

105
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:22,738
The prostitute who called herself
Margot Langer was shot to death.

106
00:10:23,944 --> 00:10:27,141
After reading this book,
why does it occur to me

107
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:31,173
that all the strange things that
happened recently are connected?

108
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:35,656
I feel like everything
is connected to Johan!

109
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,256
Sorry. I got carried away.

110
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,800
That person...

111
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:50,293
The person who collapsed
after he saw this book...

112
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,474
Does he really look like me?

113
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:57,433
Like twins?

114
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,546
Your friend Johan looks like
he's my twin, doesn't he?

115
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:09,347
Where is he right now?

116
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:15,288
He's at the book donation ceremony
at the University's library.

117
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:24,463
Oh, hold on.

118
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:25,832
Hold on.

119
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,237
Hey, Nina! Wait a second!
Wait!

120
00:11:33,914 --> 00:11:37,394
<i>The grand collection that Schuwald
Financial Group representative</i>

121
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:41,480
<i>Hans Georg Schuwald

122

124
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:53,565
<i>You could call it one of
Germany's great treasures.</i>

125
00:11:54,768 --> 00:12:02,232
<i>We have a duty to preserve this
grand collection of humanity's wisdom</i>

126
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,539

128
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:17,390
<i>A greeting from the Friedrich
Emmanuel Campus chancellor...</i>

129
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,653
<i>Professor Steinbeck.</i>

130
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:41,841
Damn!

131
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:46,353
Pull the trigger.

132
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:50,487
If I pull the trigger,
everything will end.

133
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:53,159
Move!

134
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:57,459
<i>Help me' Doctor!
I don't want to die!</i>

135
00:12:57,865 --> 00:12:59,060
<i>Doctor!</i>

136
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:02,532
<i>Doctor!</i>

137
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:27,417
<i>Mr. Maurer!</i>

138
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,406
I've got to shoot him.

139
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:49,649
I've got to shoot him!

140
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:21,904
<i>Finally. let's bring today's
guest of honor up to the stage!</i>

141
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:26,283
<i>- He is vital to the Bavarian economy</i>
- Watch closely!

142
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:28,565
<i>- And has been a tremendous influence</i>
- This is how you shoot a gun.

143
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:30,580
<i>In developing the EU's economy.</i>

144
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:35,418
<i>By donating such an enormous
collection to our school'</i>

145
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:40,332
<i>he has done Bavaria
a great cultural service.</i>

146
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:45,997
<i>I am proud to introduce
him to you now.</i>

147
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,970
<i>Ladies and gentlemen'
I give you Hans Georg Schuwald!</i>

148
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:02,852
With a gun,
you have to shoot it like this.

149
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:14,728
With a gun,
you have to shoot it like this.

150
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:33,596
People have gathered here
in great numbers.

151
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,145
It's a great success.

152
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:38,920
Mr. Schuwald is really popular.

153
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,084
He sure is.

<i>I am proud to introduce
him to you now.</i>

157
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:07,748
<i>Ladies and gentlemen'
I give you Hans Georg Schuwald!</i>

158
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:58,270
Your target is me, isn't it?

159
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,268
A lot of people came.

160
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:06,603
They all came
crawling here for you.

161
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:36,775
So that's it...
How could you?

162
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:42,448
Whoa.

163
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:43,673
Don't make any noise!

164
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,684
Watch quietly.

165
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:47,947
Got it?

166
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:57,557
<i>Everyone' listen to me.</i>

167
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:02,467
<i>I want you to stay quiet.
And stay calm.</i>

168
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:12,204
<i>I'm blind. I don't know how many
people have gathered here.</i>

169
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:15,877
<i>Don't move all at once!</i>

170
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:30,687
That's right. Stay right there.

171
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:35,626
Watch me at work.

172
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:55,177
<i>Get out of here.
Slowly. and in a single file.</i>

173
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:44,563
What's this?

174
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:45,497
What's going on?

175
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:47,199
It's over there, too!

176
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:48,033
Is it a short?!

177
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:49,435
It's a fire!

178
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,244
Get me a fire extinguisher.
Quickly!

179
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:14,895
What's the meaning of this?!

180
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:17,995
It's my job to shoot Schuwald!

181
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:19,767
What's with this fire?

182
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:30,616
I see! You changed your mind,
didn't you, Johan? This is better!

183
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:32,081
Much better!

184
00:20:33,086 --> 00:20:36,579
They're like ants. Everyone is
running away from the fire like ants!

185
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:43,086
Amazing!
You're amazing, Johan!

186
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:44,130
You're amazing!

187
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,404
Come and watch...

188
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:15,018
The books...
The books are burning!

189
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,400
Everyone is running
all over the place

190
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,095
without a thought for anyone else
and they are piling up on one another.

191
00:21:29,743 --> 00:21:30,767
Can you feel it?

192
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:33,607
This fear...

193
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:46,559
I have to shoot him.

194
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:50,660
You can't do it.

195
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:51,864
I have to shoot him.

196
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:54,658
You can't do it.

197
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:55,993
I have to shoot him.

198
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,168
You're just a doctor.

199
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,570
You can only give life.

200
00:22:05,478 --> 00:22:08,038
Taking lives is my job.

201
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:13,983
You can't do it.
