1
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:16,101
Tell Helene and Gustav to tape
"Detective Forster."

2
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:17,164
Huh?

3
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:23,809
It re-airs on Tuesday at 10 AM.
You've never seen it? It's amusing.

4
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:26,009
Milch, come on.

5
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:28,243
Now's not the time
to be joking around.

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,649
Do you know how much
trouble you've given our boss,

7
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:34,188
screwing up and
getting caught like that?

8
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:39,717
He retained me as your lawyer
even though you're an idiot.

9
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:42,190
At least thank him a little.

10
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:47,259
He sent you watch over me
so I don't say anything, right?

11
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:48,903
That's right.

12
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:54,738
Listen, Milch, you know what's going
to happen if you tell the truth, don't you?

13
00:00:57,111 --> 00:01:00,911
Don't worry.
I'll never sell out my comrades.

14
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:06,086
All right. Just file a confession
that matches my scenario. Got it?

15
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,851
Anyway, has my next job
been scheduled?

16
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:16,125
Next? When do you think that'll be?
Think about it.

17
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:18,560
You think about it.

18
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:19,459
Huh?!

19
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:22,629
Who do you think I am?

20
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:25,338
I'm Gunter Milch,
the king of prison escapes.

21
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,569
I have no time for
your silly stories.

22
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,939
Listen, if you give them
the confession I made up for you,

23
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:35,278
you'll get out in five years.

24
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,877
Tell them.

25
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:38,896
Huh?

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,915
I said, tell Helene and Gustav
to tape "Detective Forster."

27
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:48,620
Oh. But I can't really
count on them.

28
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:53,493
While I'm here in this police station,
I guess I'll try it out once more.

29
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:54,894
Try what out?

30
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,027
Do you think
he's faking it again?

31
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:38,436
I-I don't know.

32
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,640
But there was blood in his vomit
and his body is so cold.

33
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:46,044
Don't throw up here!

34
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:47,081
Doctor!

35
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:49,342
Ah. You came just in time.

36
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,176
- Huh?
- Huh?

37
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:52,177
Come take a look.

38
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:55,850
Some young folks we brought in
were getting rowdy on the third floor.

39
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:58,056
Several people were injured.

40
00:03:58,493 --> 00:04:01,087
B-But.. .he looks like
he's going to die right now.

41
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,593
Milch again, huh?

42
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,192
Let him rest in the back.
I'll take a look at him later.

43
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:11,965
Th-Then take me to a hospital.

44
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:15,301
I'll come back immediately,
so wait for me.

45
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:18,678
Honestly. People just keep
bringing patients to me today.

46
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,316
Give me a break.

47
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:32,758
You're giving me the bed
next to a serial killer?

48
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:34,989
Why is he here?!

49
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:36,291
Don't complain!

50
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:40,900
This man collapsed from starvation.
He's receiving an intravenous drip.

51
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:45,028
I feel even worse
being next to this guy.

52
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:47,234
Shut up and sleep!

53
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:48,234
Doctor...

54
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,308
How many injured are there?

55
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:52,205
I don't know.

56
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:53,776
We won't know
until we go there!

57
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:54,941
Crap.

58
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:57,274
Those kids won't
get away with this!

59
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:03,452
What we talked
about the other day...

60
00:05:06,794 --> 00:05:07,955
I need your help.

61
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:14,635
I want to escape.

62
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:29,179
I'm thinking of killing
your former fiancée...Eva Heinemann.

63
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:33,447
What do you think?

64
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:36,652
Don't you think
that's a good idea?

65
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:40,786
She knows too much.

66
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:46,629
On that rainy day, she heard three gunshots
in that building that was under construction.

67
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:50,695
She saw him.

68
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:55,874
We don't need people like that.

69
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:58,744
Isn't that right?

70
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,675
Stop. Stop.

71
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,517
Don't do it!

72
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:07,345
She... Eva won't
testify about that!

73
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:11,289
She wants me to spend
the rest of my life in jail!

74
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:15,818
She just wants me to spend the rest
of my life regretting that I dumped her!

75
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:21,798
She'll only testify against me.
So... So...

76
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,265
So that's why I'm asking you
whether you think it's a good idea.

77
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:32,480
If she's gone,
you may not have to go to prison.

78
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:41,950
Her death is advantageous
for the both of us.

79
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:46,556
Wii you tell the police?

80
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:50,259
I wonder if they'll believe you.

81
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,927
Wii you tell Verdemann?

82
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,072
He might be one of
my comrades.

83
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:09,140
We're brilliant lawyers.
We'll find a way to clear you.

84
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:14,147
When you finally get out,
you can have a good drink.

85
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:23,057
Because, by that time, that arrogant, noisy,
ruined woman will no longer be in this world.

86
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,269
I want to escape.

87
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:49,852
Give me a break!

88
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,726
I don't want to sleep
next to this murderer!

89
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:55,285
Hey, Milch, keep to yourself!

90
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:58,696
Just keep quiet or whatever!

91
00:07:58,933 --> 00:07:59,559
Milch!

92
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:04,395
I'm going to confess and
be escorted to jail in five days!

93
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:07,307
I'll be able to bid farewell
to murderers like you!

94
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:10,070
What are you
yammering on about, Milch?!

95
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:11,977
You're healthy!

96
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,577
Come on!
You really were faking it!

97
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,347
Ah... What a relief!

98
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:21,648
I just have to put up with being with
this murderer for five more days!

99
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,156
Cut it out!

100
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:26,560
Hey! Be quiet!

101
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,694
In five days...

102
00:08:42,743 --> 00:08:48,307
On that rainy day, you heard three
gunshots in a building under construction.

103
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:53,042
You saw a blond young man
come down the stairs.

104
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:55,050
Is that true?

105
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,957
That's right.

106
00:08:58,859 --> 00:08:59,826
What do you think?

107
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:03,353
Can you continue working on this
case while ignoring Johan's existence?

108
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:05,389
W-Well...

109
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:07,793
Miss Eva Heinemann...

110
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:12,237
Would you be willing to make
this important testimony in court?

111
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,757
I don't want to.

112
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:38,631
What in the world does Dr. Tenma
want so late at night?

113
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,095
What does he have to tell us?

114
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:44,599
W-Well... Anyway,
he said to call an interrogator.

115
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,611
What did you want to tell us,
Dr. Tenma?

116
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:06,390
Dusseldorf's Eisler Memorial
Hospital's Director Heinemann...

117
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:13,230
Chief of Surgery Dr. Oppenheim,
Dr. Boyer...

118
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:18,730
And my patient,
Adolf Junkers...

119
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:29,913
I did it.

120
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:41,153
I killed them all.

121
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,639
The wind blew.

122
00:10:56,343 --> 00:10:57,811
The bottle fell over.

123
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,978
The sandwiches were
covered in dirt.

124
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:07,283
That's when...

125
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:15,295
he smiled sadly.

126
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:23,666
<i>According to the police announcement,
on the fourth before dawn,</i>

127
00:11:23,737 --> 00:11:26,365
<i>Kenzo Tenma, who had been
denying all accusations</i>

128
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,603
<i>of involvement in
the multiple homicides until now,</i>

129
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:34,308
<i>suddenly gave a complete confession
of the murders of the director and</i>

130
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:38,284
<i>two other doctors of Dusseldorfs
Eisler Memorial Hospital</i>

131
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:41,946
<i>as well as the murder
of Adolf Junkers.</i>

132
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,221
N-No way.

133
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:48,653
<i>This news just in.</i>

134
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,361
- A confession? That's impossible.
<i>- According to the police announcement,</i>

135
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:52,922
<i>According to the police announcement,
on the fourth before dawn,</i>

136
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,335
<i>Kenzo Tenma, who had been
denying all accusations until now,</i>

137
00:11:57,404 --> 00:12:01,466
<i>has admitted to
the allegations.</i>

138
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:06,079
No way.

139
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,181
What did you do
to Dr. Tenma?!

140
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,353
What kind of torture did you subject him
in order to extract this false confession?!

141
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:16,889
Could you get
your hands off of me?

142
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:20,419
Shut up!
Let me see Tenma!

143
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:25,023
I'm going to meet him in person and expose
what happened to him during interrogation!

144
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,334
It's no use, Dr. Reichwein.

145
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:36,670
He refused to see me
though I'm his lawyer.

146
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:41,408
It seems that his confession
really was of his own accord.

147
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,010
That's impossible!

148
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:48,851
I've done some research.
I know the interrogators.

149
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:51,589
They're not the kind of people
that would use torture.

150
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:58,021
It seems that Tenma confessed
willingly. Astonishingly willingly.

151
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:03,561
Mr. Verdemann, could it be that you also
believe that Tenma's confession is real?

152
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:10,570
I can't tell his motives
unless I see him.

153
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:13,609
I believe in him.

154
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:17,478
Dr. Tenma is innocent!

155
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:22,450
I believe in him!

156
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:37,866
Verdemann speaking.

157
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:39,797
Oh, Mr. Baul.

158
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:42,301
<i>I'm sorry for calling you
at this time.</i>

159
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:44,174
<i>I can't meet you there because
of some urgent business.</i>

160
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:45,338
That's all right...

161
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:48,808
<i>How was it?
Was Dr. Tenma serious?</i>

162
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,450
Oh. He refused to see me.

163
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,180
How troublesome.

164
00:13:53,821 --> 00:14:01,558
Just as we were trying to
prove his innocence,

165
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:03,596
he gives a complete confession.

166
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:07,359
<i>In that respect,
your father was quite admirable.</i>

167
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:12,672
He never caved in,
no matter how harsh his interrogation.

168
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:15,772
He continued to
plead his innocence.

169
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:18,503
<i>His innocence.</i>

170
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:21,807
Now then...

171
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:25,884
What should we do now,
Mr. Verdemann?

172
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:27,854
<i>Mr. Verdemann?</i>

173
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:29,487
Huh? O-Oh.

174
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:33,683
<i>That woman...
What did you say her name was?</i>

175
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:38,096
<i>The important witness who could
prove Tenma's innocence...</i>

176
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:40,526
Oh. Eva Heinemann.

177
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:44,930
<i>Where is she right now?</i>

178
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:46,564
She's at a hotel in the city.

179
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:49,877
I'd like to meet her.

180
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:56,444
No. She's a pretty difficult woman.
I'll meet with her by myself.

181
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:06,384
My father was admirable, huh?

182
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:31,851
Open up, Miss Heinemann.
I know you're in your room.

183
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,585
The maid said that
she couldn't make the beds

184
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:38,454
because you spent the entire day
in your room drinking.

185
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:44,890
Miss Heinemann... I know very well
that you hate Dr. Tenma.

186
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:48,294
Your life would have
continued to go well

187
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:51,235
if your relationship with Tenma
had continued

188
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:54,070
even after you had lost your father,
the hospital director.

189
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:58,108
But Dr. Tenma dumped you.

190
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:02,805
Indeed, Dr. Tenma threw
your life into disorder.

191
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:06,186
My father...

192
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:10,780
My father was jailed on
suspicions of espionage.

193
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:16,493
For a long time, I was looked upon
as the son of a spy.

194
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:19,795
My father threw
my life into disorder.

195
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:27,731
But I didn't give in. Why?
Why do you think I kept on fighting?

196
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:34,307
Because I believed,
my father was innocent.

197
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:39,550
My father is innocent.
My father is innocent.

198
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:43,486
Innocent... Innocent...

199
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:48,227
Those I believe in
must be innocent!

200
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:50,823
Prove Tenma's innocence!

201
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,463
Tenma must be innocent!
Just like...

202
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:57,501
Just like how my father
had to be innocent!

203
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,477
Here's where you can
reach my partner and me.

204
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:13,182
Please contact us when
you feel like testifying.

205
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:36,943
What?!

206
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:38,703
He's being transported to
the detention center tomorrow?

207
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,407
It's only been a few days
since his confession.

208
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:45,279
<i>It's because Tenma's
confession was so willing.</i>

209
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,550
Can't we do anything,
Mr. Verdemann?

210
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:53,986
<i>The police are trying to reason
with Tenma into seeing us.</i>

211
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:56,892
<i>Anyway
where's Eva Heinemann?</i>

212
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:58,521
She went out.

213
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,425
<i>Huh?</i>

214
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:03,164
She's probably
drinking at some bar.

215
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:10,301
Dusseldorf...

216
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:13,771
I know all these places.

217
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:16,382
What a wretched town.

218
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,543
Oh. You're here?

219
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:52,484
I've been sitting here
for five minutes.

220
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:53,881
Oh. Sorry.

221
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:57,447
I was copying down
a very interesting essay.

222
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:00,721
Sh-Shall we move elsewhere?

223
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:05,025
Oh yeah. Let's go eat!
Where would you like to go?

224
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:07,963
Italian?
How about French?

225
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:09,594
Why don't you
keep on writing.

226
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:10,362
Huh?

227
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:13,636
Just stay there
and keep writing.

228
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,932
Oh. Eva...

229
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:16,769
Eva!

230
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:42,291
Is that so?

231
00:19:43,336 --> 00:19:44,804
That's wonderful.

232
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:46,096
Isn't that delicious?

233
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:46,932
Yeah.

234
00:19:51,745 --> 00:19:53,008
What are you doing?

235
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:54,380
What am I doing?

236
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:57,780
I'm placing stones so the wind
doesn't blow it all away.

237
00:19:58,418 --> 00:20:01,945
That's not what I mean.
Why are you laying it out here?

238
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:05,355
It's nice to have lunch out here
every once in a while.

239
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:06,793
The weather is nice.

240
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,124
Who's having lunch?

241
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:13,900
We are. I made sandwiches.
I hope you like them.

242
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:15,601
There are bugs.

243
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,036
It's all right.

244
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:21,274
What is this?

245
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:27,773
Oh.

246
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,044
They're all covered in dirt.

247
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:37,056
It's a complete disaster.

248
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:49,869
Do you want to
eat one too, lady?

249
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:54,164
Hey, Franz!

250
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:55,231
That's rude!

251
00:21:00,814 --> 00:21:01,804
Thank you.

252
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:07,186
Is it good?

253
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:18,898
Walk.

254
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:32,845
Get in.

255
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,919
Oh. Hello?

256
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:50,457
Mr. Verdemann wasn't answering,
so I called you.

257
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:55,132
<i>Oh. His wife just gave birth,
so he's probably at the hospital.</i>

258
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:59,739
<i>I've heard rumors about you,
Eva Heinemann.</i>

259
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:03,533
<i>If you like,
you can talk to me.</i>

260
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:05,542
I was thinking of talking.

261
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:07,141
<i>About what?</i>

262
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:10,350
Testifying to
Tenma's innocence...

263
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:12,980
<i>I see. That's good.</i>

264
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,748
<i>So...
What hotel are you at?</i>

265
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,828
<i>I see.</i>

266
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:30,528
I'll be right over.
