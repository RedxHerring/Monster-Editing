1
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:10,498
What'll you have?

2
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:12,199
The usual.

3
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:14,899
What was "the usual"?

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,502
When are you going to
remember it Robby?

5
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:23,269
A hamburger, double cheese, extra
ketchup, and thick slices of tomato.

6
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:25,511
I'll kill you if you
put pickles in it.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,814
How am I supposed to
remember that?

8
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:44,897
That Chinese or Vietnamese guy
is sniffing you out.

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,695
He's been coming here often.
He was asking who you were.

10
00:00:55,677 --> 00:00:58,772
He's not Chinese
or Vietnamese.

11
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:00,271
Oh?

12
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:02,079
He's probably Japanese.

13
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,081
And he's a neurosurgeon.
And a brilliant one at that.

14
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:11,350
Isn't that right, Dr. Tenma?

15
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:16,730
Answer me!

16
00:01:22,303 --> 00:01:25,762
And you used to be engaged to
the hospital director's daughter.

17
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,202
What are you planning
to do with Eva?

18
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,277
Eva?

19
00:01:32,714 --> 00:01:34,148
You're being too
familiar with her.

20
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:36,279
When are you going to stop
thinking of her as your fiancé?

21
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:41,251
From what I hear, you're no
longer a doctor, but a fugitive.

22
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,284
Just get in there and get out.

23
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:47,325
If you behave you might
get out one day.

24
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:50,360
Let Eva go.

25
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:55,168
Let her go?
I haven't been confining her at all.

26
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,429
Actually, she's been going
to parties every day.

27
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:02,204
Let me. ..see Eva.

28
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:04,468
"Let you see her"?

29
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:13,579
Hey, hey.

30
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:15,956
Don't mess up my shop.

31
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:20,083
Don't hang around
here anymore.

32
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:21,655
Get out of here.

33
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:24,531
E-Eva...

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,026
Get lost.

35
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,921
You saw Kenzo?

36
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:05,222
Yes, two days ago.
Thought I'd let you know, just in case.

37
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:11,129
He wanted to see you.

38
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:22,106
You didn't hit him, did you?

39
00:04:22,683 --> 00:04:26,278
N-No. I wouldn't do that.

40
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:28,055
We're leaving.

41
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,848
Huh? Did you have
enough of today's party?

42
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:36,128
For today.
Or rather, the party is over.

43
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:39,266
I think.

44
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,068
Good work, Eva.

45
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,904
How about dinner?

46
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,347
Let's go.

47
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:01,749
So you dropped her off with
your client at the restaurant

48
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,552
and you're eating
dinner here?

49
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:06,550
The hamburgers here
are way better

50
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:10,188
than the food at those parties
and expensive restaurants.

51
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:14,096
I'm not sure whether you're
praising me or insulting me.

52
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:30,680
You sure are persistent.

53
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:33,348
Do you want to
get hurt again?

54
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,217
What part of "get lost"
don't you underst–

55
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:42,796
Don't move either,
Mr. Manager!

56
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:44,932
If you move, I'll shoot!

57
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:47,763
What a dangerous doctor.

58
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:49,328
Who hired you?

59
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:53,606
I know that your immediate boss
is The Baby.

60
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:57,068
But the person who ordered you
to escort Eva

61
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:58,873
is someone further up
in the organization.

62
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,706
Who gave you your orders?!

63
00:06:01,716 --> 00:06:03,206
I don't know who he is.

64
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,947
But. ..I know his face.
He wears glasses.

65
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:13,323
A man with glasses?
What is he making Eva do?

66
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:17,593
I told you, didn't I?
He's just making her go to parties.

67
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:21,331
She drinks, eats, and leaves.
That's it.

68
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:26,630
That can't just be ! Eva should have
been ordered to perform a specific task!

69
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,167
Nothing.

70
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,872
Come to think of it, today...

71
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:34,773
Today...

72
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:37,076
No, it's nothing.

73
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:39,686
She pointed.

74
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:41,555
Pointed?

75
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,887
To a young man.

76
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:46,082
A young man...

77
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,224
Like this.

78
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,589
He was a young blond man
with a pretty face.

79
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,491
That was it though.

80
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,703
Where is Eva right now?

81
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:03,608
She's having dinner with my boss,
the man with the glasses.

82
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:04,770
W-Where?!

83
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,907
Tell me quickly!
Where are they?!

84
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,783
Eva's job is probably over!

85
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:17,185
<i>Once this job is over,
I'll probably be killed.</i>

86
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,688
<i>The party is over.</i>

87
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:22,095
Where is Eva?!

88
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:27,493
Wait!

89
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,519
W-Where is she?

90
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:56,994
I dropped her off at her hotel.

91
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:04,564
Do you have a gun?

92
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:08,936
N-No. I try not to
carry one around.

93
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:11,334
Then use this.

94
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:17,111
Kill her.

95
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,221
<i>That party was the same
as it always was.</i>

96
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:30,654
<i>The smell of alcohol,
the smell of perfume,</i>

97
00:08:30,731 --> 00:08:32,096
<i>meaningless laughter...</i>

98
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:34,799
<i>It was the same as always.</i>

99
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:38,765
<i>Except for that one moment.</i>

100
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:44,334
<i>The moment when Eva
pointed at a young man...</i>

101
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:50,211
<i>When she did,</i>

102
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:54,983
<i>the man with glasses appeared with
another well-dressed young man.</i>

103
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,220
<i>Then, those two young men
shook hands.</i>

104
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:03,487
<i>I didn't notice it at the time.</i>

105
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:07,791
<i>It seems that that's when
Eva's job was over.</i>

106
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:27,449
I knew that you would be
the one to kill me.

107
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:35,122
Go right ahead.
The drinks are settling in nicely.

108
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:38,661
I have no lasting regrets.

109
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:47,400
Oh, that's right.
You can't shoot me in this hotel.

110
00:09:48,242 --> 00:09:50,677
You told me before that
you shot your girlfriend

111
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:53,372
and found yourself in
a pool of blood, right?

112
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:56,644
Take me outside
and shoot me.

113
00:09:56,917 --> 00:10:00,547
If you don't, you'll have to pay
for messing up the room.

114
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,923
Oh. I do have one regret...
one last thing.

115
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:10,728
But. ..it doesn't matter.

116
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,729
I wonder what I did today?

117
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,201
You saw me pointing,
didn't you?

118
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:23,406
I probably did
something terrible.

119
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:27,676
I let a terrible person and
a demon come together.

120
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:31,782
Did I bring Mephistopheles
and Faust together?

121
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:35,647
But it doesn't matter.

122
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,119
It looks like I don't need to
go to parties anymore.

123
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:48,427
But I still have my invitation
to the next party.

124
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:55,442
If you want, you can go and confirm
what I've done after you shoot me.

125
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:02,942
Now then. .. Finish me off.

126
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:06,686
Let's run away.

127
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,186
Run away with me.

128
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:16,693
You seem to be getting
the wrong idea.

129
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:20,166
Run away with you?
You're kidding, right?

130
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:25,303
When did we
become so friendly?

131
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,976
I can't kill people anymore.

132
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:34,811
Can't kill people? Are you saying
that you could kill a devil?

133
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,548
I'm a devil.

134
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,596
That suit and necktie
I bought for you

135
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,248
were the same as the ones
that Kenzo used to wear.

136
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:46,551
Understand? I was just turning you
into Kenzo Tenma.

137
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:48,718
Kill me.

138
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:56,368
Kill me quickly!

139
00:11:57,805 --> 00:11:59,000
Quickly!

140
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:04,474
Kill me...quickly.

141
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:12,379
If you don't kill me quickly...
you'll be killed.

142
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,626
Kill a devil, huh?

143
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,075
<i>Hey, wake up!</i>

144
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:43,073
<i>It's all right.
I'm just sobering up a bit.</i>

145
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:46,183
<i>No! You'll die
if you sleep here!</i>

146
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,649
<i>It's all right.
Just leave me here.</i>

147
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,799
You look depressed.

148
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:46,271
I'm always depressed.

149
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:49,580
Did someone come
looking for me?

150
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:56,053
No, no one. But the Japanese man
from yesterday left this.

151
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,121
Helbrau Hotel, room 205.

152
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:04,154
He said to call him
if something happened.

153
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:07,601
What will you have?
The usual?

154
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:14,004
Not now. I won't feel like doing anything
if I fill myself with your crappy burgers.

155
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:15,709
Where are you going?

156
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:17,870
A party.

157
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:24,973
How strange. I can go anywhere
if I have a necktie.

158
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,254
With just this...

159
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,292
There he is.

160
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:43,831
So is he a devil?

161
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,734
<i>He shook hands
with so many people.</i>

162
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:49,902
<i>So many that his hands
were probably swollen.</i>

163
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:53,473
<i>Then he left the party.</i>

164
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,574
Floor six, huh?

165
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:36,256
But which room is his?

166
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:45,893
Please come in.

167
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:50,967
Right this way.
Have a seat.

168
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:52,572
Don't hesitate.

169
00:15:57,945 --> 00:15:59,879
You want to meet him too,
don't you?

170
00:16:01,114 --> 00:16:01,740
Him?

171
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:05,277
I'm waiting for him as well.
He'll be here soon.

172
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:08,755
Before he comes,
let's talk about something.

173
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,080
What should we talk about?

174
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,154
Oh yes.

175
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:16,019
Let's talk about
the end of the world.

176
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:21,663
<i>The young man happily talked.</i>

177
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,505
<i>Like a child who was
telling his parents</i>

178
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:29,440
<i>about something fun that
happened at school that day.</i>

179
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:33,876
<i>That's how he talked to me.</i>

180
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:41,046
<i>The end of the world?
The silly talk of a fanatical young man.</i>

181
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:43,347
<i>That's what I thought
at the time.</i>

182
00:16:45,826 --> 00:16:48,454
What do you think?
Interesting, isn't it?

183
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:51,458
Were you amused, Martin?

184
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,535
How do you know my name?

185
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:00,940
Oh yeah,
let's talk about you next.

186
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:04,404
You've been with The Baby for
almost three years, haven't you?

187
00:17:05,112 --> 00:17:06,602
You looked me up?

188
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:09,209
Before that,
you were in prison.

189
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:11,542
Eight years...
That must have been terrible.

190
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:17,350
You got out on good behavior, right?
You sure got out quickly, for a murder.

191
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:20,957
Was it fun living
with your girlfriend?

192
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:25,421
The girlfriend you shot.
Her name was.. .Edda.

193
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,830
That's in pretty bad taste, boy.

194
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,563
She was quite
the drug addict wasn't she?

195
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:35,207
You desperately tried
to get her clean.

196
00:17:35,742 --> 00:17:37,608
That's pretty difficult to do.

197
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:40,337
Was it love?

198
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:42,916
Do you want to get hurt?

199
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,185
She recovered. She made dinner and
waited for you to return home each day.

200
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:50,584
Your happy life
together began.

201
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:53,454
I said, "do you want
to get punched?"

202
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:55,228
But that night...

203
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:58,866
When you returned to your room,
you saw something outrageous.

204
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,966
She was with her ex-boyfriend.

205
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,930
She had done drugs again.

206
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:15,145
Though disoriented, she saw you and
said over and over again, "I'm sorry."

207
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:19,477
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

208
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,387
"I'm sorry."

209
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,353
But you shot her along
with that man.

210
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:29,993
That was the story at your trial.

211
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:32,429
Why did you lie?

212
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:36,358
She killed herself, didn't she?

213
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:40,668
Your lawyer determined
that she killed herself

214
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,800
because there were traces
of gunpowder on her hand.

215
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,208
But you stuck to the story
that you shot her.

216
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,250
She asked you to kill her,
didn't she?

217
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:58,117
Am I right?!
I'm right, aren't I?

218
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,290
I thought so.
You weren't the one who shot her.

219
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,489
Back then, she told you
to shoot her, didn't she?

220
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:09,497
<i>Shoot me.</i>

221
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:15,297
<i>Don't look at me like that!
Kill me.</i>

222
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:17,303
<i>Kill me!</i>

223
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:20,539
<i>Martin!</i>

224
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,028
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

225
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:38,025
<i>She shot herself!
It wasn't me!</i>

226
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:47,568
<i>Right? It wasn't me, right?</i>

227
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:57,543
I thought so. Amazing.
I'm right, aren't I?

228
00:19:58,218 --> 00:19:58,844
No.

229
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:01,148
You left her behind.

230
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:04,055
That's how you
granted her wish.

231
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:05,083
No.

232
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:07,188
Then what about your mother?

233
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:14,534
Your mother froze to death
when you were ten.

234
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:17,765
At that time,
you left your mother behind.

235
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:21,474
Am I right again?

236
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:25,409
Amazing, amazing. I'm surprised.
I really got it right.

237
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:30,815
Everyday, you'd carry
your alcoholic mother home.

238
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:31,676
Isn't that right?

239
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,755
Your mother would always tell you
to leave her where she was.

240
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:42,824
Even so, you'd carry her home
every day. But that night...

241
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:46,794
<i>No, you can't sleep here.</i>

242
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:51,598
<i>It's all right. It's all right.
Leave me right here.</i>

243
00:20:57,644 --> 00:20:58,736
<i>Wake up!</i>

244
00:21:16,696 --> 00:21:17,891
You left her there.

245
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,996
Isn't that right?
You left your mother there.

246
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:26,028
The next day, you were informed
that your mother had frozen to death.

247
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:30,199
But at that time,
you thought that you weren't at fault

248
00:21:30,277 --> 00:21:33,042
and that you left her there
because she told you to.

249
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,774
That's right.
You're not at fault.

250
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:39,751
Your mother and your drug-addicted
girlfriend both wanted to die.

251
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:43,947
You were letting people who
wanted to die, do what they wanted.

252
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:46,621
You're not wrong.
You're right.

253
00:21:47,294 --> 00:21:50,320
You released them
from the pain of living.

254
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:58,004
Eva also wants to die.

255
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:12,679
<i>It was at that moment...
the devil arrived.</i>

256
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,357
<i>I passed by him,
careful not to look.</i>

257
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:24,962
<i>Like a child, I repeated to myself,
"Don't look, don't look. Don't dare look."</i>
