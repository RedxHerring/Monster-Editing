1
00:00:10,598 --> 00:00:11,622
You look well.

2
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:13,193
Yes.

3
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:16,500
How's work? Things going well?

4
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:17,864
Yes.

5
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:19,968
That's good.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,006
Is Rosemary also doing well?

7
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:28,739
She's fine.
She's made a lot of friends.

8
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,077
I see. That's good.

9
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:35,583
Yes, I'm glad.

10
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,216
I'm sure she's gotten
used to school and...

11
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,326
Excuse me.

12
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:43,329
Sorry, but I have to get going.

13
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,500
I've brought a photo of Rosemary.

14
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:51,029
Could you let me see her?

15
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:55,338
How about the day after tomorrow?

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,877
At this restaurant...

17
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:05,475
I've completely quit drinking.

18
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:07,450
My life's back in order.

19
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:12,087
No. This may be the first time
I've been living a normal life.

20
00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:15,519
I realized how much I lost.

21
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,125
I'll let her decide whether
she wants to see you or not.

22
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,271
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

23
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:27,932
I've got to get going now.

24
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:29,302
Okay.

25
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:10,476
Yes?

26
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:15,187
Some more coffee.

27
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:47,073
Doctor!

28
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:49,547
What kind of person do you think
this man is?

29
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:51,548
Hey, Richard!

30
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:52,478
Huh?

31
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:55,852
Why do you think you're here?!

32
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:59,390
You're here for counseling.

33
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:02,953
I keep telling you,
I'm not a fortune-teller!

34
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:06,860
It's the result of many years
spent interviewing clients, right?

35
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,329
Who is that boy?

36
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:12,302
He was the first person at the scene.

37
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:17,208
This guy was the one
who discovered Fahren's corpse.

38
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,247
It seems he's just a friend.

39
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,079
Say, Richard...

40
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:22,809
Huh?

41
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:27,445
Working hard is fine,
but you need time to relax as well.

42
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,279
I'm taking it easy!

43
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,816
Well, that's good.

44
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:33,424
Actually...Doctor...

45
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:34,888
What is it?

46
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,089
I may be able to see my daughter.

47
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:42,600
Oh? You must be
looking forward to that.

48
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,496
Yes!

49
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,136
- But...
- Huh?

50
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:48,471
Even if you see her, you can't
regain what you've lost.

51
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:51,441
Be prepared for that.

52
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,505
Yes.

53
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:56,440
Whatever happens,
don't touch any alcohol!

54
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:57,678
Got it?!

55
00:04:58,486 --> 00:04:59,453
Don't worry about it!

56
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,685
Are you going back to work again?

57
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,850
Yes.

58
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:04,524
How about it?

59
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:06,784
Isn't it about time you deal with

60
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:10,525
the event that got you
kicked off the police?

61
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:12,896
Yes...of course.

62
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:17,668
He was 17 years old...
a serial murderer...

63
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:21,364
I shot him dead.

64
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:25,111
I was drunk on the job.

65
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:29,750
Good. You cannot escape from it.

66
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:34,751
You cannot rid yourself of it.
But what's important is...

67
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:38,222
That I move on...right?

68
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,353
Good. You're a pretty good student.

69
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:43,291
Was that a perfect score?

70
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:47,434
Don't be silly! I don't give out
perfect scores that easily!

71
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:51,896
Besides, perfect people are boring.

72
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:02,349
No way!

73
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,800
Karl Neumann...

74
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:31,163
A business major with the University
of Munich's Economics Department.

75
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,409
Like Fahren, he told that prostitute
that he was Schuwald's son.

76
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:40,943
I don't know whether
he was telling the truth.

77
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:44,246
But this boy may somehow be...

78
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:48,148
Yes?

79
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,426
Mr. Richard, I'm finished cleaning,
so I'll be going now.

80
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,854
Oh. Thank you always
for your hard work.

81
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:57,128
It's not hard work at all.

82
00:07:57,698 --> 00:08:03,102
It's pretty rare for a man
living by himself to be so neat.

83
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:06,834
Well... I was pretty bad before.

84
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:11,511
You've got a new picture
of your daughter.

85
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:14,845
Yes. I'll be able to see her soon.

86
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:17,750
Oh my! That's wonderful.

87
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:19,445
Your daughter will be delighted!

88
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:20,854
You think so?

89
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:26,219
Of course. Any girl would be
happy to see her father.

90
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,233
Oh? That's good.

91
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:37,935
So were you able to
turn in your paper?

92
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:41,338
<i>Karl Neumann...</i>

93
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:45,906
<i>Why don't you tell Schuwald
that you're his son?</i>

94
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,384
<i>Are you also a swindler?
Or are you the real thing?</i>

95
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:55,654
<i>If you really are Schuwald's son...</i>

96
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:01,423
<i>You should know parents always
want to see their children.</i>

97
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:38,328
Sorry. She said that
she doesn't want to see you.

98
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,762
Well, that's fine.

99
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,610
Sorry, I also...don't have time.

100
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:51,838
Okay.

101
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:55,539
Oh...I see. That's fine.
Don't worry about it.

102
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:57,443
I'll be off then.

103
00:09:58,085 --> 00:09:58,677
Okay.

104
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:32,845
Yes?

105
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:38,525
Can I get you something?

106
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:41,192
G-Get me a whiskey.

107
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:42,355
All right.

108
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:54,731
Here you go.

109
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,292
Huh?

110
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,726
Excuse me...

111
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:44,953
<i>Then I'm going to where Dad is.</i>

112
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,326
<i>Not right now!</i>

113
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:50,188
<i>If you're an adult and still
want to meet him...</i>

114
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:52,896
<i>But you mustn't expect anything.</i>

115
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,663
<i>You mustn't hate him
even if he's cold to you!</i>

116
00:11:56,637 --> 00:11:58,731
<i>Because I don't hate him.</i>

117
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,142
<i>Take this with you.</i>

118
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,370
<i>This is something your father
gave you when you were born.</i>

119
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:20,789
"The daffodils of Lares bloom proudly
with no one to admire them."

120
00:12:21,662 --> 00:12:24,927
"The trees of Pieria rustle
with no one to mind them."

121
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:29,794
"Oh, bloody tracks
of a nameless man..."

122
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:32,330
Wonderful.

123
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:33,399
Huh?

124
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:38,374
Neumann, you've really become
a wonderful reader.

125
00:12:38,712 --> 00:12:41,079
Oh. Thank you.

126
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:46,382
I'm impressed that you've
mastered Latin in such a short time.

127
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:49,185
Actually, I'm being taught.

128
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,521
Oh? You have a splendid teacher.
Who is he?

129
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:57,721
Johan... Johan Liebert.

130
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:03,267
Johan, huh? He's perfect.

131
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:04,530
Yes.

132
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:06,537
It's not only his Latin.

133
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:07,633
Huh?

134
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:09,773
It's also his knowledge of law
and economics.

135
00:13:10,044 --> 00:13:14,379
No, he has a perfected philosophy
for everything.

136
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:19,082
He's a boy who has been perfected
to the point of beauty.

137
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:24,883
U-Umm...Mr. Schuwald...

138
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,825
What if a boy like him...

139
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,992
What if he was your real son?

140
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:45,545
He smiled.

141
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:49,115
Schuwald actually smiled.

142
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:55,846
It seems that you're worthy enough
to be his son.

143
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,158
To be honest, I was jealous.

144
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:01,958
No matter how you look at us,
you're clearly better than I am.

145
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,328
I felt ashamed of my envy.

146
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,299
Why don't you tell him who you are?

147
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:09,228
Huh?!

148
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:15,064
Tell Schuwald that you're his real son.

149
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:16,509
Stop that!

150
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,775
I keep telling you that I never intended
to do that from the beginning!

151
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:23,517
He'd never believe me
even if I did tell him!

152
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:29,454
Not only that, but he'd think that I was
some hyena who's after his fortune!

153
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:31,115
I don't want that!

154
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,593
The life that my mother led
until she died.

155
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:37,460
The way I've been living until now...

156
00:14:38,732 --> 00:14:42,327
For him to think of me like that
without knowing these things...

157
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:43,662
I don't want that!

158
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:48,766
That's why you're going to
tell him who you are.

159
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:54,781
You're going to make him
see the truth.

160
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:57,041
He won't believe anything!

161
00:14:57,718 --> 00:15:00,278
You should have something
he'd have to believe.

162
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:02,248
Huh?

163
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:07,788
Something that will make him
believe that you're his son.

164
00:15:09,463 --> 00:15:11,830
I-I don't have anything like that.

165
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:15,225
Think back.
You should have something.

166
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:17,598
I said that I don't have anything!

167
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:20,069
I don't plan on telling him!

168
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:25,405
Then why are you
learning Latin from me?

169
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:29,445
Is it because you want him
to be happy?

170
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:32,975
Is it because you
want him to like you?

171
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,191
I'm thinking of quitting my job
reading to him at his place.

172
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,361
I'll quit already.

173
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:49,599
Thank you for worrying about me.

174
00:15:51,004 --> 00:15:51,971
It's fine already.

175
00:15:57,511 --> 00:16:01,675
Johan... Just between
you and me...the thing is...

176
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:05,380
I do have proof.

177
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:08,180
What is it?

178
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:13,950
But I have no intention of using that
to convince him that I'm his son!

179
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,258
My foster parents are coming
to visit me next week.

180
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:22,968
I've made up my mind. I'm going to.

181
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:24,563
I see.

182
00:16:25,672 --> 00:16:27,538
Just so your determination
doesn't waver...

183
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:33,106
It might be best if
I held on to that proof.

184
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:38,685
We're glad you're doing well.

185
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,077
Right, dear?

186
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:41,247
Yes.

187
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:44,583
I was worried about whether
you were eating properly.

188
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:49,121
Well, I'll get fat if I keep eating out,
so I'm being careful.

189
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:51,621
You'll get fat on
your mother's meals as well.

190
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,267
That's because they're so delicious!

191
00:16:54,568 --> 00:16:57,560
How's college?
Did you make any friends?

192
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:01,640
Yeah. I can talk about
anything to them.

193
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:04,443
I see. That's the best.

194
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:08,045
We can tell that you're doing well
just by looking at your face.

195
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,076
I'm grateful to you that I can
study here like this.

196
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:16,088
Whoa, what is this all of a sudden?

197
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,617
I've been moving around from
foster home to foster home until now,

198
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:22,924
but the both of you
really treated me well.

199
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:26,228
That's because
you're a very wonderful kid.

200
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:27,862
That's right, Karl.

201
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:31,394
Thank you very much, Mr. Lindner.

202
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:37,645
Could you stop calling me
Mr. Lindner already?

203
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:44,780
Wii you accept our offer to adopt
you?

204
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:51,083
You said to wait a while
after you got into college,

205
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:53,752
but I think it's about time...

206
00:17:55,696 --> 00:18:01,294
We trust you.
You trust us as well, don't you?

207
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,002
Of course.

208
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:08,298
Your true father and mother
might be alive somewhere.

209
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:14,006
No matter what we do,
we may never be the real thing.

210
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:15,739
That's not true!

211
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:21,655
The both of you...
are my real father and mother.

212
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:28,621
Dear...

213
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:35,428
Let's have a toast! We'll have
an especially expensive wine today!

214
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:36,562
Yes!

215
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,803
You there, could you
bring a wine menu?!

216
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:41,772
Today's a special day!

217
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:56,957
Yes, hello?

218
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,522
<i>Neumann? It's me.</i>

219
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:04,330
Mr. Schuwald...

220
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:09,229
<i>I was told that you were
going to quit your part-time job.</i>

221
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,196
Yes.

222
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:13,331
<i>That's unfortunate.</i>

223
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:16,275
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

224
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,271
<i>You've worked hard.</i>

225
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:22,141
<i>I'm impressed at how far
you've come with your Latin.</i>

226
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:24,342
Thank you very much.

227
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:29,346
<i>It's very unfortunate.
I'll really miss you.</i>

228
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:36,787
<i>If it's fine with you, could you read
something to me one last time?</i>

229
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:39,491
Yes, I'd be glad to.

230
00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:44,800
How about the third part
of "From Aeolis to Lemnos"?

231
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:47,403
<i>Ah, that would be nice.</i>

232
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:53,875
"That mysterious sea even wishes
for the death of the god, Phoebus."

233
00:19:55,282 --> 00:19:56,477
"What pleasures could there be"

234
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,987
"other than to wish for the death of
the sons and daughters of Cerberus?"

235
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:06,990
"'Now, go on"Zeus whispers,
'go on, go on."'

236
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:10,892
"Dance in the temple
of the dark gods."

237
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:17,570
"Gods of Juno who dwell in the sea,
the earth, and the heavens..."

238
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:28,674
"Steal Campania's forbidden apple
from the summit of the Parthenon..."

239
00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:31,373
"...and all come here."

240
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:35,456
"My heart...my desire..."

241
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:40,387
"My heart..."

242
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,352
Mr. Schuwald...that call just now...

243
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,197
That was wonderful.

244
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:23,127
It was the most pleasant reading
that I have ever heard.

245
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:26,732
Why have you hidden this
all this time?

246
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:29,409
Th-That's...

247
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:35,638
This is definitely the rabbit's foot
that I gave to your mother, Margot.

248
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,687
It was a charm to bring you good luck
when you were born.

249
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:43,347
This is yours.

250
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:44,750
Karl...

251
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:50,095
I put you through a lot.

252
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:55,896
Father!

253
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:00,802
My son.

254
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:11,678
This is all thanks to him.

255
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:16,449
He told me.

256
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:21,858
He's going to be working with me
as my secretary.

257
00:22:24,197 --> 00:22:26,359
He's a young man I can trust.
