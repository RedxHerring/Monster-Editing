1
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:10,865
Where's the crime scene?!

2
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:12,233
It's down in the basement.

3
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:13,701
Who are the victims?!

4
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:14,792
Three men!

5
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:17,367
Examine the surroundings closely!

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,168
I was going to wait for Detective Kratky
to come and give orders.

7
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:24,576
I'll take responsibility!

8
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:27,238
If you find anyone suspicious,
take them into custody!

9
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:29,681
B-But what kind of people
should I look for?!

10
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:31,483
Anyone suspicious!

11
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:33,454
But...

12
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:36,489
Are you saying that you can't follow
my orders because I'm a rookie?!

13
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:37,825
Get moving!

14
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:42,389
I'm Detective Suk
of the Prague Police!

15
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:52,334
This is really terrible.

16
00:00:56,678 --> 00:00:57,770
Inspector Zeman...

17
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:01,806
He was savagely
beaten to death.

18
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:05,143
You can't make out
his facial features.

19
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:08,866
If he hadn't had his police
pocketbook with him,

20
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,380
we probably wouldn't have
known who he was.

21
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:15,120
The bodies of two other men
are over there...

22
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:18,463
We still don't know
who they are.

23
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:21,796
One was shot in the head.

24
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:25,730
The other was beaten to death.
Just like the Inspector.

25
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:31,742
Secure the crime scene!

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,579
Oh... Detective Suk!

27
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:35,875
Umm...

28
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,442
What kind of person would you
consider suspicious?

29
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,854
Give me a break.

30
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:23,987
They're making fun of me
just because I'm a rookie!

31
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,986
The uniformed officers
won't take my orders!

32
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:32,089
That's because
you're so unreliable.

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,026
Yeah!

34
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:34,392
What?!

35
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:36,329
You threw up at the crime scene,
didn't you?

36
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:39,932
Why would they take orders
from such a poor detective?

37
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:47,606
Just because you admire police dramas
doesn't mean that you can do the job.

38
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:51,479
Jan, always got carried away,
even in college!

39
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:55,280
What do you know about me?

40
00:03:56,591 --> 00:04:00,789
Inspector Zeman was killed.
Do you know how well he treated me?!

41
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,896
As a rookie,
I didn't know right from left.

42
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:09,703
But Inspector Zeman taught me
how to be a detective.

43
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:14,733
I respected Inspector Zeman
from the bottom of my heart.

44
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,680
I will avenge Inspector Zeman!

45
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,450
I'll catch his murderer myself!

46
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:28,355
U-Umm...

47
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,751
We start work
early tomorrow, so...

48
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:34,092
What? Hang out
with me longer.

49
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:35,321
I'm...

50
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:42,865
fighting for justice
so you can work safely!

51
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:44,963
Come on. Drink more!

52
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,529
Cut it out already!

53
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,780
You serve justice every day.

54
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:00,249
And you just get killed.

55
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:02,589
It's unbearable.

56
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:06,624
There are no rewards.

57
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:18,231
What's wrong?

58
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:20,934
The girl from the supermarket...

59
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:21,835
Huh?

60
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,741
I saw her twice when I went to
the supermarket after my night shift.

61
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:29,008
That girl...

62
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:32,245
I wanted to talk to her,
but I couldn't.

63
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,285
And now I see her here.

64
00:05:35,923 --> 00:05:40,224
Hey, give it up!
She's too pretty for you.

65
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:42,823
U-Umm...

66
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:48,130
H-Hi! Do you remember me?

67
00:05:50,104 --> 00:05:51,299
I-I see...

68
00:05:52,406 --> 00:05:54,602
But I know you.

69
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,538
Oh, I'm Jan Suk.

70
00:05:58,246 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm not suspicious at all.

71
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,547
I may not look it,
but I'm a real police detective.

72
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,647
No. Don't be scared
because I'm a detective.

73
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:09,256
I'm off-duty right now.

74
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:11,048
This is my personal time.

75
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:14,691
I don't think he's got a chance.

76
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:17,363
Well, let's help him for now.

77
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:20,895
Sorry for butting in!

78
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,261
He's depressed today.

79
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:25,365
Could you talk to him for a bit?

80
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:29,206
Something terrible happened
to a superior he admired.

81
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,303
He's been depressed.

82
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:34,010
Wh-Who's depressed?!

83
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:39,349
I've never met a person
as kind as he was.

84
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:43,555
I wanted to become
like Inspector Zeman.

85
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,789
That's why I won't
forgive his murderer.

86
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:49,826
I'll catch him.

87
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:53,758
Oh... Sorry.
I'm the only one talking.

88
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:54,994
Not at all.

89
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:58,029
You've got to try your best
for the inspector's sake

90
00:06:58,105 --> 00:06:59,470
to catch his murderer.

91
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:00,668
Yeah.

92
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:04,973
Oh... I talked a lot
about myself,

93
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:06,810
but I didn't ask you
anything about yourself!

94
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:09,141
What's your name?

95
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,483
I don't know my real name.

96
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,156
W-What?

97
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:20,089
Oh. Wait a second!

98
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:22,120
I'll guess who you are.

99
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,965
I'm a detective.
Leave this to me!

100
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:28,229
Umm... Your name is...

101
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:32,695
I don't even know that.
There's no way that you would know it.

102
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:36,005
What I know about myself is...

103
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:41,781
Cedok Bridge...
Three frogs...

104
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:44,384
That's it.

105
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:45,278
What?

106
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,746
Oh!

107
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:47,754
Wait a second!

108
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:49,452
When can I see–

109
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:51,885
See? It wasn't any good!

110
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,957
Give up this fleeting dream!

111
00:07:57,365 --> 00:08:01,529
CHECK PLACEMENT We've identified the two men
who were killed along with Inspector Zeman.

112
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:07,272
One is Čestmír Marat.
The other is Yakov Suhacek.

113
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:11,438
Both were sergeants in
the Czech secret police.

114
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:16,549
After the fall of socialism,
they did shady underground jobs.

115
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:20,553
Our analysis of the blood at
the scene of the murder revealed

116
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:25,491
blood belonging to someone other than
Inspector Zeman, Marat and Suhacek.

117
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:28,889
Blood type AB, RH positive.

118
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:30,996
Judging from the amount
of blood he left behind,

119
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:33,727
we believe that this person
was also seriously injured.

120
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:35,762
We are trying to
determine who he is.

121
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,765
Detective Suk!

122
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:39,639
Suk!

123
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:41,108
Y-Yes!

124
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:43,001
Why are you daydreaming?!

125
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:47,607
We lost a brilliant colleague in Zeman.
We're in a desperate situation now.

126
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:49,247
What's with your attitude?!

127
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:50,943
I...

128
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:52,944
I'm very sorry.

129
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:54,545
Anyway...

130
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:56,767
As I said at the beginning,
according to a witness,

131
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,351
there was a man who was
walking around the crime scene

132
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:01,486
immediately after the murder.

133
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:05,361
He was tall, thin man who
was carrying a large bag.

134
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:07,094
He looked like a traveler.

135
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:10,770
Do your best to
find out who he is!

136
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:18,438
That girl...

137
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,384
She won't come again,
will she?

138
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:26,453
Mr. Great Detective.

139
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,424
Did you find the murderer?

140
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,427
N-No.

141
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:35,362
How pathetic.

142
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,197
The murderer is walking free
while I'm just sitting here.

143
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:40,834
Inspector Zeman...

144
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:44,698
He was investigating a murder
all night the day before.

145
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,807
What kind of case was it?

146
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:50,443
Someone killed an old man who
was running an illegal orphanage.

147
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:52,910
They killed his maid, too.

148
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:57,973
He was questioning the man who
first discovered the scene of the crime.

149
00:09:59,086 --> 00:09:59,678
Who was he?

150
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:00,947
Huh?

151
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:03,919
Who discovered
the crime scene?

152
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:08,352
Well... He seemed
like a nice man.

153
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:12,392
He was tall and thin, but he was
lugging around a heavy knapsack.

154
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:18,496
Thin... Tall... Large bag...

155
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:19,999
Could it be?!

156
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:22,639
Do you know
where that man is?

157
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:24,802
I-I think I know!

158
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:26,170
If I check at the station...

159
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:29,142
Hello?

160
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:30,843
Oh!

161
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,053
Good luck,
Mr. Great Detective!

162
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:36,381
Oh... Hello?

163
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:38,450
Oh, hold on a second!

164
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:39,893
Hello?

165
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:58,145
<i>Cedok Bridge...</i>

166
00:10:58,846 --> 00:10:59,938
<i>Three frogs!</i>

167
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:05,450
Cedok Bridge is in
the Mikalska area of the old city.

168
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:08,850
Three frogs.

169
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,480
Here it is.

170
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,586
I can meet that girl
if I come here!

171
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,842
He checked out?!

172
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:04,203
When?!

173
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:07,014
Umm... Mr. Grimmer,
Mr. Grimmer...

174
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:10,849
Mr. Grimmer checked out in
the morning the day before yesterday.

175
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:13,386
There's no mistake.

176
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:18,451
The man who killed Inspector Zeman,
is the man who stayed here. Grimmer!

177
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,660
Crap! Why didn't I figure
this out earlier?

178
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:27,501
Inspector Zeman,
I will catch him!

179
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:29,161
I will!

180
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:32,331
Oh.

181
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,139
Oh?! Suk, why are you here?

182
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,006
Detective Chief Patella,
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

183
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:42,849
I see.

184
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,980
You got this far all by yourself.
Impressive.

185
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:48,347
Yeah.

186
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:51,954
But I thought I would
be the first one

187
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:54,654
to accomplish something in
the Inspector Zeman case.

188
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:58,798
If you've already
come this far...

189
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:01,694
Well, an accomplishment is
an accomplishment. Good job!

190
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:02,595
Okay.

191
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:06,998
Or so I'd like to say.
Keep this a secret!

192
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:08,935
Huh?

193
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:14,012
Why?! It's our job to catch Grimmer
as soon as possible!

194
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:17,948
This case is a little more
complicated than you think.

195
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:19,077
Huh?

196
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,245
Did you know
that Inspector Zeman

197
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:24,291
was assigned to
a top-secret investigation?

198
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:28,087
Inspector Zeman had
a top-secret investigation?

199
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:33,793
He was investigating former
Czechoslovakian secret police agents

200
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:37,303
who faked their records and
were in the Prague police force.

201
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:41,366
Former Czechoslovakian
secret police?

202
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,347
The two other men who were killed
were secret police agents, right?

203
00:13:48,782 --> 00:13:52,480
Only a few others aside from
the chief and me know about this.

204
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:56,555
You might get yourself killed
if you inquire further!

205
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:03,562
Keep quiet about this.

206
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:04,457
Got it?

207
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:09,903
Then... Then what
should I do?

208
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:15,601
Well... Anyway, Grimmer might
come to this hotel again.

209
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:16,976
Keep watch.

210
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:18,178
Y-Yes, sir!

211
00:14:21,582 --> 00:14:24,882
By the way, Suk,
did you get a girlfriend?

212
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:25,777
Huh?

213
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:28,555
When you were sitting
at your desk at the meeting,

214
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,351
you were daydreaming.

215
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:33,058
Sh-She's not my girlfriend!

216
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:36,562
She just goes to the bar
I visit every so often.

217
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:38,732
Is she pretty?

218
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,267
W-Well...

219
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:43,596
Come on!
Introduce me to her.

220
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:45,230
Which place is it?!

221
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,269
I can't introduce you.

222
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:52,605
But she's not your girlfriend,
is she?

223
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,105
W-Well that's true, but...

224
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:03,083
Suk's not coming today.

225
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:09,161
I'm surprised!
You're really something!

226
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,356
Who are you?

227
00:15:10,898 --> 00:15:13,697
Oh, Me?! I'm Suk's superior.

228
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,091
My name is Patella.

229
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:19,099
He said that there's a real beauty
that comes to this bar.

230
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,644
He couldn't come tonight.
He's doing a stakeout.

231
00:15:25,212 --> 00:15:26,373
Care to have a drink with me?

232
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:31,376
Oh... Hey, hold on.

233
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,986
Why not just a little?!

234
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:44,053
Hey, Suk!

235
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:46,329
Oh! Detective Janacek.

236
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:47,634
Good morning.

237
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:53,667
I heard from Patella that the girl
you're after is a real beauty!

238
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:56,342
Patella, you went to that bar?

239
00:15:57,544 --> 00:15:58,170
Yeah.

240
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:03,012
Y-You didn't do anything to her,
did you?!

241
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,576
Now, now, Suk.
Don't get excited!

242
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,055
B-But Detective Chief Patella
is a notorious womanizer.

243
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:14,161
Don't worry.
She jilted me pretty quickly.

244
00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:22,159
She'll be pretty tough to get
if Patella can't get her, Suk.

245
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:23,599
N-No way!

246
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:30,668
I-I...just want to talk to her.
It's fun just doing that.

247
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:32,704
What are you mumbling about?

248
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:36,942
Section Chief Farobek wants you to
go to Inspector Zeman's office.

249
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,446
Oh... Yes, sir!

250
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:40,480
Oh yeah.

251
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:43,256
Someone gave me these.

252
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,915
Do you want
a whiskey bonbon?

253
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:46,182
I don't need any!

254
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:47,958
Suk, how about one?

255
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:49,855
Oh... No thank you.

256
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:51,689
Hey, Suk!

257
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,225
Yes?

258
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:59,063
Don't say anything about
our tall suspect.

259
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:01,600
Yes, sir!

260
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:06,104
Inspector Zeman's desk has
pretty much been cleaned out.

261
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,878
All that's left are
his personal belongings.

262
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,851
Gather all the things here
and send them to his wife.

263
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:14,747
Yes, sir.

264
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,037
It's a gym locker key.

265
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:45,847
This is pretty bad!

266
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:49,684
There are a ton of
sweaty shirts and towels.

267
00:17:59,166 --> 00:17:59,792
Documents?

268
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,027
What is this?

269
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:08,240
It's a file containing detailed histories
of all the members of the force.

270
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,974
Even my file is in here.

271
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:16,948
<i>Do you know
that inspector Zeman</i>

272
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:19,076
<i>was assigned to
a top-secret investigation?</i>

273
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:24,251
<i>He was investigating former
Czechoslovakian secret police agents</i>

274
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:27,760
<i>who faked their records and
were in the Prague police force.</i>

275
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:33,559
Huh?

276
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:35,392
What's the meaning of this?

277
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:39,934
Why are Detective Chief Patella
and Detective Janacek's files

278
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:41,065
the only ones not here?

279
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,323
Yes indeed, this is an unusual
amount of money.

280
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:03,928
Y-Yes, Head Chief!

281
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:11,594
So... Suk, what do you
surmise from this?

282
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:16,376
Yes! Inspector Zeman was
performing an internal investigation.

283
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,039
A-As a result,

284
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:24,015
he discovered that Detective
Chief Patella and Detective Janacek

285
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:27,987
were former Czechoslovakian
secret police agents and...

286
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:34,986
It's very... It's very unfortunate,
but Inspector Zeman probably

287
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:40,125
took the money in return for
keeping quiet about the truth!

288
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,670
This is a serious problem.

289
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,607
I-It's very unfortunate.

290
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:55,148
Detective Suk...

291
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:56,342
Yes!

292
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,585
Don't talk about this for a while.

293
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:00,478
Yes, sir!

294
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:04,623
I'll contact you later.
Return to your normal duties.

295
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:05,918
Yes, sir!

296
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:16,796
How frustrating.

297
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,035
Yeah... Things have
become troublesome.

298
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:25,105
It was foolish of us to underestimate
young guys like Suk.

299
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:29,075
We haven't even settled things with
that tall guy who killed Zeman.

300
00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:31,977
And another problem arises.

301
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:35,880
Should we offer money,
like we did with Zeman?

302
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,451
If it doesn't work,
there's only one thing to do, right?

303
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:43,794
No matter what,
I don't want any trouble

304
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:49,098
for knowingly accepting
former secret agents into the force.

305
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:53,105
We just have to
cover it up well.

306
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:57,600
Ah, I'd like to have a drink!

307
00:20:58,245 --> 00:21:00,270
I have some whiskey bonbons.

308
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:06,652
Don't say that.
It's a gift from a real beauty.

309
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:07,979
Here.

310
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:09,681
Here.

311
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:21,329
What's wrong?
You look depressed.

312
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:30,303
I can't believe
anything anymore.

313
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:35,444
What's wrong?
I'll listen if you want me to.

314
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,608
I believed in him.

315
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,250
I didn't think that Inspector Zeman
would do such a thing.

316
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,623
What happened?

317
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,121
I believed in him.

318
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:08,213
Right now,
my only peace of mind...

319
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:22,662
is you.
