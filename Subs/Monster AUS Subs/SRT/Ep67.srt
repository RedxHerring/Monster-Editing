1
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:10,153
<i>It's all right.
Hang in there.</i>

2
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:13,493
<i>Shoot me.</i>

3
00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:15,028
<i>Kill...</i>

4
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:19,304
<i>I'll save you.</i>

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,260
Are you going to shoot me
like you did then?

6
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:43,629
Yes.

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,390
I'm going to put an end to this.

8
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:49,203
The end...

9
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,634
What is the end?

10
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,508
The end...

11
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:56,010
The end...

12
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:57,378
The end...

13
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:58,913
The end...

14
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:00,571
The end...

15
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:02,616
The end...

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,757
I've seen the end of
the world over and over.

17
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:15,356
What is the end?

18
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:18,065
This will end.

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,597
You're going to die
and I'm going to die.

20
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:24,905
You've seen?

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,601
What did you see?!

22
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:30,039
What have you seen?!

23
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:43,286
You don't know.

24
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:48,820
I'll tell you...

25
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:53,266
a truly terrifying story.

26
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:08,148
I'm back.

27
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,178
A truly terrifying story,
you say?

28
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:01,018
The story of
the many things I saw...

29
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:09,795
All those things I told you...

30
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:24,180
I was taken from the room
at the Three Frogs.

31
00:04:25,486 --> 00:04:30,720
I was put in a pitch-black room
without any walls.

32
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:36,587
There was an odd sensation
to whatever I touched.

33
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:40,099
The room had no sense of
up or down, left or right.

34
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:46,039
But I knew that someone
was watching me.

35
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,306
It was a completely
soundless room.

36
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:51,171
No.

37
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:56,008
Sometimes I could hear
a voice screaming.

38
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,581
Meals would come
from somewhere.

39
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:07,259
I counted how many
times they came.

40
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:11,955
Five...Six... Seven...

41
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:17,233
Eleven... Twelve... Thirteen...

42
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:21,401
Twenty-one... Twenty-three...

43
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:25,780
When I started to lose count...

44
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:43,586
A man stood there.

45
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:46,630
<i>Listen, listen well.</i>

46
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:51,138
<i>People can become
whatever they want to be.</i>

47
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:01,474
<i>Oh?</i>

48
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:07,145
<i>Should a small child like you
be walking around here?</i>

49
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:12,484
<i>Well, that child is...</i>

50
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:14,824
<i>So this is that child.</i>

51
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:26,266
<i>My, how cute.</i>

52
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,475
<i>Ah. So this is the child.</i>

53
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:32,377
<i>How wonderful.
What a beautiful child.</i>

54
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,605
<i>Take a look. This is the child.</i>

55
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,406
<i>So this is the child.</i>

56
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:37,645
<i>The result...</i>

57
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:39,382
<i>The result indeed.</i>

58
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:40,845
<i>So this is the child.</i>

59
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:42,383
<i>This child is...</i>

60
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,504
<i>- Ours...is. .. with the result...</i>
- I only remember parts

61
00:06:57,571 --> 00:07:00,063
<i>- to his new...</i>
- of the welcome speech...

62
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,541
<i>This.. .for us. ..
the chosen ones...</i>

63
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:07,310
<i>A toast to our country's future!</i>

64
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:09,783
<i>- Cheers!
- Cheers!</i>

65
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:36,073
The first person collapsed.

66
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,345
The people around
rushed to him.

67
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:46,183
They also collapsed,
one by one.

68
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:55,152
Moans... Shrieks... Screams...
Fear filled the room.

69
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:05,537
The 42 people in
that room died.

70
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:15,013
Leaving only
Franz Bonaparta...

71
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:29,296
I ran to escape
from that place.

72
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:48,512
I didn't even realize that I had scratched
my arms on the roses in the garden.

73
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,050
I ran.

74
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:56,179
When I arrived at the Three Frogs,
you greeted me.

75
00:08:57,758 --> 00:09:05,758
I continued talking.. .for days and days
about everything I experienced.

76
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:24,043
You're wrong.

77
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:30,783
You're wrong.

78
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:34,620
You're wrong.

79
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,467
You're wrong!

80
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:52,302
Nina...
Can you hear me, Nina?

81
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,801
Calm down, Nina.

82
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,573
It's me...Tenma.

83
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,646
You know who I am, right?
It's me...

84
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:15,658
Yes. That's right.
Calm down.

85
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:23,934
All right. That's a good girl.

86
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:39,653
It's all right. It's all right now.

87
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:43,655
You're wrong, you're wrong,
you're wrong.

88
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:47,194
It's not me.

89
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:53,263
I wasn't the one who said
"Welcome home."

90
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:55,726
The one who said it...

91
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:59,604
What. ..I said...

92
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:18,525
<i>I'm back.</i>

93
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:20,660
<i>Welcome home.</i>

94
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:27,365
Johan's wrong.

95
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:30,902
Johan just listened
to my story.

96
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:34,402
The one who was taken
to Red Rose Mansion...

97
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:40,302
The one who was taken to
Red Rose Mansion...was me!

98
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:56,756
Getting dragged down those steps
at the Three Frogs...

99
00:12:58,032 --> 00:13:03,129
Being in that pitch-black room
with no walls and counting meals...

100
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:07,974
Standing, surrounded
by all those corpses...

101
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:12,538
All of it...

102
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,181
It was all me!

103
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:26,319
I'm scared.

104
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:29,588
I'm scared.

105
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:33,392
I'm scared.

106
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:13,773
<i>I'm back.</i>

107
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:15,642
<i>Welcome home.</i>

108
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:42,197
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

109
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:47,201
<i>Well... well...</i>

110
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:55,011
I talked...

111
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,483
for days and days.

112
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:00,182
That's enough.

113
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:07,250
I told Johan what I had experienced.
Johan thinks that my experiences...

114
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:08,754
That's enough already.

115
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:14,964
Johan thinks that my experiences
are his experiences.

116
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:18,964
Because of me, Johan...

117
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,006
That's enough already!

118
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:26,873
I told everything to Johan earlier.

119
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:30,406
Johan listened to my story.

120
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:36,757
It looked as if he was smiling. ..
but it also looked as if he was crying.

121
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:39,522
I've...

122
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,460
I've never seen
anyone look like that.

123
00:15:45,432 --> 00:15:48,527
I couldn't shoot him.

124
00:15:49,837 --> 00:15:56,265
But I'm sure that he's going to
destroy himself. ..just like me.

125
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:57,670
Don't...

126
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:00,877
Just like how I'm going to
destroy myself!

127
00:16:01,014 --> 00:16:01,640
Don't!

128
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:06,679
Don't...

129
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,548
If you die...

130
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:13,888
If something happens to you...

131
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:16,860
What will I do?

132
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:22,266
If you die. ..where can I go?

133
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:24,995
Please live.

134
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:29,936
Please.. .
no matter what happens...

135
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:36,939
I beg you.

136
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:50,124
Yes. It's me.

137
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,632
You found a car near
the mountain villa?

138
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:59,136
Yeah.
It's at the bottom of a cliff.

139
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,869
Edward's inside, dead.

140
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:05,076
He was probably killed by...

141
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:24,294
Johan is probably...

142
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,763
going to kill Franz Bonaparta.

143
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:40,212
His son is in Prague.
I told Johan about that.

144
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,487
But...

145
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,656
will it really
end at just that?

146
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:54,956
I'm not sure his destruction
will end there.

147
00:18:11,912 --> 00:18:13,505
His sister's memory...

148
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:18,875
Where something is
missing from her memory...

149
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,850
Johan has another
memory inside.

150
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:38,397
Just what were we trying to create,
Franz. ..Franz Bonaparta?

151
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,567
Live.

152
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:15,373
We will.. .find it, the place where
you should be, where we should be.

153
00:19:16,543 --> 00:19:18,011
We'll find it somewhere.

154
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:38,527
Hey. I'm really glad you came.

155
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,465
I never thought you'd come

156
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,997
Come in, come in.

157
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:50,840
I was just making some tea.

158
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:57,210
I wanted you to try some of
my wonderful tea.

159
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:05,017
What do you think?
Do you like it?

160
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:07,326
It's a special herb tea.

161
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,928
For you to come to me...

162
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,202
means that you have some pretty
important business, don't you?

163
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,835
Ask me anything.
I'll get prepared immediately.

164
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:26,506
Who do you want me
to kill next?

165
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:35,548
Huh? Don't joke around.

166
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,754
Stop that.

167
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:44,487
The dream...

168
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:47,834
I woke up from it.

169
00:20:49,302 --> 00:20:50,633
Are you tired or something?

170
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:53,101
What are you going to
do about your plan?

171
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:55,308
I woke up.

172
00:20:56,743 --> 00:21:02,204
Hold on a second. What did I gather
all that money for anyway?

173
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:05,785
I woke up from the dream.

174
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,255
What did I kill all
those people for?

175
00:21:10,023 --> 00:21:13,015
Many visions of the end...

176
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:18,353
But...right now,
I see a different vision.

177
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,358
A vision of the true end.

178
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:35,906
A memory only I have.

179
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:40,584
The real place I must go to.

180
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:45,918
Huh?

181
00:21:59,105 --> 00:22:02,075
The place I must go to...

182
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:27,389
Ruhenheim...

183
00:22:29,102 --> 00:22:30,069
This is it.
