1
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,557
Well, well...you've found
some wonderful property.

2
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:17,101
It's a convenient twenty-minute drive
from the center of Berlin;

3
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:19,902
in a well-located
and nice neighborhood.

4
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:26,003
It's rare to find this sort of property
on the former East side.

5
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:27,281
Umm...

6
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:29,527
Wasn't this the residence
of Mr. Liebert,

7
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,613
the consultant to the former
East German Trade Commission?

8
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:35,122
Huh?

9
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,721
What? You just came
to investigate Mr. Liebert?

10
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:42,494
Is that all?! You're not a customer?

11
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:46,595
Sorry... There was something
I just had to find out.

12
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:51,398
I wouldn't know anything about
an official who died ten years ago!

13
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:56,542
The Lieberts adopted twins
while they were here.

14
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:58,707
I told you, I don't know anything...

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,675
What about the landlord?

16
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:02,376
Can you introduce me to him?

17
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:06,196
Listen...most of the land in
the former East side is the property

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,349
of Jewish capitalists who escaped
from the Nazi regime.

19
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:13,290
The eastern government was paying
foreign countries and capitalists

20
00:01:13,394 --> 00:01:15,556
from the west side
and borrowing land.

21
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,998
The landlord for this property
is overseas...

22
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:21,764
Besides, my company is
a west-side real estate company

23
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:23,702
that prospered after
the destruction of the Wall.

24
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:26,401
I don't know anything about the past.

25
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,706
Now, get out.
I'm going to lock the gate...

26
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:32,623
isn't there anyone who knows
about ten years ago...

27
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,706
someone who
remembers Mr. Liebert?

28
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,412
As I told you, this is a residential area
for ex-government officials.

29
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:43,124
Most fled after the Wall came down.

30
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:45,922
Especially from the officials from
the Ministry of the interior...

31
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:49,828
Oh! Come to think of it...

32
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:54,433
An ex-official of the former East German
Department of Commerce

33
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:56,025
lives ten houses away from here...

34
00:01:57,572 --> 00:02:02,271
Yes, Mr. Liebert. He didn't have to
take such a risk, only to die.

35
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,939
If only he had waited
just a little longer,

36
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:06,037
until East Germany collapsed...

37
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:11,241
It makes you wonder why
he went to a free country...

38
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:12,984
Just to be killed of all things...

39
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:16,788
Did Mr. Liebert have twins?

40
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:18,590
Twins?

41
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,194
Oh, I remember!

42
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:26,798
Those twins that Mr. Liebert adopted
from the orphanage!

43
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:28,002
Orphanage?!

44
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:30,501
They were such cute kids...

45
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,804
Mr. Liebert always wanted children.

46
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:35,701
W-Where is that orphanage?!

47
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:37,607
Umm... I think it was...

48
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:40,911
Hmm... 511 ?

49
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:45,983
Yes, that's right,
I think it was 511 Kinderheim...

50
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:49,624
511 ...Kinderheim?

51
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:35,780
The site of this orphanage will soon
be turned into a supermarket.

52
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:41,594
I'm relieved that this creepy building
is finally going to be destroyed.

53
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:47,998
Excuse me, do you know anyone
from this orphanage?

54
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:50,796
Someone from here?

55
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:53,599
There isn't anyone.

56
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:56,702
I don't want to talk about it.

57
00:05:57,845 --> 00:05:59,074
It's so creepy.

58
00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:00,337
B-But...

59
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:05,462
If you really want to find out,
there's Hartmann over on 47th St.,

60
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:08,547
who worked at the old
Ministry of Health and Welfare.

61
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:31,873
Hey there... Do you know someone
named Hartmann who lives around here?

62
00:06:36,183 --> 00:06:37,150
What's wrong?

63
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:39,786
You're injured... Let me take a look.

64
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:44,853
It's all right. Don't be afraid.
Let me take a look.

65
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:49,260
You've injured a healing wound...

66
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:50,898
It's festering.

67
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:52,799
Suck it up!

68
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,698
This will sting a little,
but this will help you get better.

69
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,535
All right, that's good...

70
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,917
Don't trip!

71
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:11,811
You'll get hurt again!

72
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:18,859
Hartmann...

73
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:44,049
I became the foster parent to all those
kids after the fall of East Germany.

74
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:45,575
Foster parent?

75
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:51,284
Yes, I took care of them until they
were adopted or went off on their own.

76
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:54,791
The president of
an accessories company

77
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:56,556
adopted the kid in the middle.

78
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:59,896
The kid to the left
is in the military right now.

79
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:03,326
I'm even taking care of one right now.

80
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:05,396
It must be hard work.

81
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:07,607
I wouldn't call it work.

82
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:13,013
I worked for many years,
dealing with orphans,

83
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,014
as the district official for
the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

84
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:18,046
I opposed the way that the government
was treating them at the time.

85
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:26,254
After the fall of socialism, I wanted to
help the children in my own way.

86
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:30,023
I'm poor and things
haven't gone my way...

87
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:35,166
but, still, it's much better than
the orphanages that they were in.

88
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:38,729
511 Kinderheim was
a special orphanage

89
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:41,385
that was run by both
the Ministry of Health and Welfare

90
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,934
and the Ministry of the interior.

91
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:49,778
Well, all orphanages in East Germany
were more or less like that,

92
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:54,044
but special orphanages
were the worst of them all...

93
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:57,784
It wasn't just an institution
for children with nowhere to go...

94
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:03,621
It was a gathering for
the children of criminals,

95
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:06,743
captured political offenders,
and the children of those

96
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,633
suspected of being rebels and spies.

97
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,249
That's why it was expected that
they would be discriminated against

98
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:13,832
and treated inhumanely...

99
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:18,134
The children there couldn't do
anything about their situation...

100
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:25,009
It was a clash between socialism
and totalitarianism...

101
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:30,456
The government told the public that
the orphans would be reeducated

102
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:32,219
and turned into model socialists.

103
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:34,154
But in reality,
they were treated like criminals.

104
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:37,456
The directors and instructors
were horrible...

105
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,727
The worst ones would confiscate
packages sent to the children

106
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:43,964
and sell them.

107
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:46,767
Who were the real criminals?

108
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:52,070
Fear and violence ruled
the special orphanages.

109
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:55,478
No person would grow up
normal there.

110
00:09:57,718 --> 00:10:00,346
Then that incident happened...

111
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:03,481
incident?
What happened at that orphanage?

112
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:08,287
You said that you wanted to
ask me about the twins, didn't you?

113
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:11,263
Do you know something about them?!

114
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:15,412
I don't know much about the sister
because she was left at an orphanage

115
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:16,460
in a different district.

116
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:20,501
But I do know about
the brother, Johan.

117
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:24,009
Johan! Yes, I want to
know about Johan!

118
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:34,477
It was...It was top secret.

119
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:38,818
The East German government
placed a strict gag order on it.

120
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,719
Well, it was a long time ago...

121
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:47,034
I think it's all right to talk about it...

122
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:48,702
What is this incident?!

123
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,535
What did...What did Johan do?

124
00:10:57,278 --> 00:10:58,245
A revolt...

125
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:05,585
I'm home...

126
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,849
Dieter, we have a guest.

127
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:09,384
Come and greet him.

128
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,857
Oh!

129
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:13,494
Dieter, what's with your attitude?

130
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:15,557
Aren't you going to greet him?

131
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,395
L-It's okay. We already met
in front of the house.

132
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:21,301
Right?

133
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:25,805
Oh...I'd like to hear the rest.

134
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,307
No...

135
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:29,102
Not in front of the child.

136
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:31,202
Oh...you're right.

137
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:34,974
It's already late so we should
meet another day.

138
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:38,618
Dieter!

139
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:43,880
Would you care to
have dinner with us?

140
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:45,726
S-Sure.

141
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:57,126
Mr. Tenma, you say that
you're a freelance journalist.

142
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,349
Does that mean that you're going to
write an article about the things

143
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:00,363
that you've investigated?

144
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:02,543
Y-Yes, that's right.

145
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,676
Then, this is one thing
I want you to emphasize...

146
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:09,192
The development of a child

147
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:11,548
all depends on the adult
that raises him.

148
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,254
We must lead children
in the right direction.

149
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:22,494
That's when children can
have pleasant dreams.

150
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,197
Dreams, huh-?

151
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:27,592
Dieter, what dreams do you have?

152
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:31,304
A soccer ball...

153
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:32,672
Huh--?

154
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:34,504
I want a soccer ball!

155
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:36,710
I see...

156
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:39,913
Thank you for dinner.

157
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:42,912
I'd like to continue where we left off
another time.

158
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,914
Sorry we couldn't
finish our conversation.

159
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:50,023
I'll come again.

160
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:51,585
Perhaps I can come tomorrow.

161
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:04,471
Dieter...

162
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:38,564
Umm... Excuse me.

163
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:41,274
Can I come in?

164
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:51,975
Mr. Hartmann!

165
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:53,320
It's Tenma.

166
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:54,421
Mr. Hartmann!

167
00:13:57,925 --> 00:13:59,689
Mr. Hartmann! Mr. Hartmann!

168
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:01,255
What happened, Mr. Hartmann!

169
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:04,764
Mr. Hartmann...

170
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,164
M-Mr. Tenma...

171
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:10,770
Dieter!

172
00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:12,872
What happened?

173
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:13,973
He fell.

174
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,039
He was standing on the chair and...

175
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:18,476
Oh, Dieter.

176
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:21,791
Ow...ow, it hurts...

177
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:23,180
Where does it hurt, Dieter?

178
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:24,880
It hurts...

179
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:27,087
Mr. Hartmann, call an ambulance!

180
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:28,347
O-Okay.

181
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,253
Dieter, let me take a look.

182
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,260
What are all these scars?!

183
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,667
Is this it?

184
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:42,493
Does it hurt here?

185
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:44,805
Two ribs are broken...

186
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:48,500
And his clavicle is dislocated.

187
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:51,405
How did he get this injury
from falling off a chair?

188
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:56,815
The ambulance will be here soon,
so it's all right.

189
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:58,480
O-Okay...

190
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,142
But what are all these injuries?

191
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:01,953
I told you that it's all right...

192
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:04,114
So you can leave.

193
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:05,458
But...

194
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,426
The way you touch those injuries...

195
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:10,459
It's as if you're a doctor...

196
00:15:10,898 --> 00:15:12,161
Oh...well...

197
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,767
Tenma...

198
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,229
I thought I heard
that name somewhere.

199
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:18,930
You're a doctor, aren't you?

200
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,371
You're the one wanted for murder...

201
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:25,578
This injury...

202
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:28,472
Where are all these injuries
on his body from?

203
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:33,586
Nevermind that... Shouldn't you
be running away, Mr. Tenma?

204
00:15:34,321 --> 00:15:37,188
I called the police
along with the ambulance...

205
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:41,691
Mr. Hartmann! I'm asking you
how Dieter got all these injuries!

206
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,191
It shouldn't matter
to someone like you,

207
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:47,700
who's wanted for murder.

208
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:54,764
It's just as I expected from a fugitive.
You're very short-tempered.

209
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:56,600
You did it, didn't you?!

210
00:15:57,444 --> 00:15:59,310
Did it? Did what?

211
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:02,547
You were abusing Dieter.

212
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,050
Abusing?

213
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:06,920
Don't say such ill willed things
about me.

214
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:08,512
Right, Dieter?

215
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,352
What do you plan to do?

216
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:16,654
I'm going to take him to the hospital.

217
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:19,957
First murder, and now kidnapping?

218
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:22,368
Don't move!

219
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,870
You'll be caught even if you do that.

220
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:34,676
It's all right, Dieter! I'm going to
get you to a hospital!

221
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:37,741
I'm afraid of the hospital...

222
00:16:38,118 --> 00:16:39,085
There's nothing to be afraid of!

223
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,284
The doctors will get you better.

224
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:46,853
Mr. Hartmann always
makes me better...

225
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:56,669
You're covered in injuries...
You've never been to a hospital?!

226
00:16:57,738 --> 00:17:02,835
I'm afraid... Right now,
the world is full of bad things.

227
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:06,945
That's why I have to be strong!

228
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:08,815
Strong...

229
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:10,717
Did Mr. Hartmann tell you that?

230
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:12,552
The world is dark...

231
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:14,752
The future is dark...

232
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,827
That's not true!

233
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:24,262
It's a big lie that the world is dark!

234
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:26,366
Really?!

235
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:27,734
Yes, it's true.

236
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:29,563
Oh, I forgot.

237
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,136
Here... A soccer ball.

238
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:33,373
Wow!

239
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:37,368
Tomorrow will be...a good day.

240
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:46,348
Sorry for coming at this hour.

241
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:49,987
It's all right... But we're crowded with
emergency cases at the moment.

242
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,354
It might take a while
until we can see him.

243
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:54,085
Could you do something about that?

244
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:57,395
There was a very big accident.
-The bus driver died instantly.

245
00:17:57,731 --> 00:18:00,996
We need to ask the truck driver about
the circumstances of the accident.

246
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:03,698
He broke both his legs,
but he can still talk, can't he?

247
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:06,032
We have to treat him first.

248
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,340
Question him later.

249
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:12,344
Then, we'll be waiting here.
-U-Umm...

250
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,343
I'll be back in two hours.

251
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:15,648
Huh?

252
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:17,849
Please take care of that boy.

253
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:26,850
Also, please don't let anyone
leave with him other than myself.

254
00:18:27,694 --> 00:18:28,855
U-Umm...

255
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,155
ls the accident site cleaned up?

256
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:33,162
No, it's still backed up...

257
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:36,326
Now then...

258
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,862
What should I do now?

259
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:40,539
First, what to do with Dieter?

260
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,774
Even if I go to the police...

261
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:44,876
I can't go with him.

262
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:50,979
<i>I don't know much about
Johan's sister because</i>

263
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,746
<i>she was left at an orphanage
in a different district.</i>

264
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:56,251
A different orphanage...

265
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,781
That's it.

266
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:10,030
There's a child that you
want me to take in?

267
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:15,039
So, who are you? Why are you
coming here at this hour?

268
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:19,005
I know it's an unreasonable request,
but this kid...

269
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,041
I know that the kid is being abused.
But if I don't know who you are...

270
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:27,652
Umm...Well...

271
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:32,951
I can't take in a child from
someone so suspicious.

272
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:38,663
U-Umm...could this be the orphanage
that took care of Anna Liebert?

273
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:40,525
Anna Liebert?

274
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:43,968
You know Anna Liebert?

275
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:47,174
S-So Anna was here?

276
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:49,769
Yes. How nostalgic...

277
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,738
How is Anna doing? Is she well?

278
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,670
Y-Yes.

279
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:57,577
Right now, she's going
to Heidelberg University...

280
00:19:58,285 --> 00:20:00,583
I see. She's doing well!

281
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:02,553
Anna was a nice girl...

282
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,988
I knew she was adopted by
Mr. Liebert of the Trade Commission

283
00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:08,960
along with her twin brother.

284
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:10,406
Umm...

285
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,556
What was his name?

286
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:12,899
Johan.

287
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,797
Yes, Johan, Johan.

288
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:19,796
They were very close,
but I felt sorry for them

289
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:20,873
when they were placed
in separate orphanages.

290
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:27,406
Those two were really alone
before they came here.

291
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:32,818
When they were taken into custody
near the border of Czechoslovakia,

292
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,512
they were holding hands
as they walked.

293
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,217
They both were shivering in the cold.

294
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,092
At first, Mr. Liebert only
wanted to adopt Johan.

295
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:46,432
But Johan wouldn't go
without his sister...

296
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:50,329
Thankfully, Anna got to be happy.

297
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:53,649
I heard that the conditions
of the orphanages

298
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:55,539
of the east side were horrible.

299
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:58,743
We're not like 511 Kinderheim.

300
00:20:58,879 --> 00:20:59,846
Huh?

301
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:14,751
Inge, the bathroom isn't that way.

302
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:16,395
Okay? See?

303
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:21,064
Mommy...

304
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:25,569
It's all right. It's all right...
There's nothing to be afraid of.

305
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:28,300
Now...you can go to the bathroom
by yourself, can't you?

306
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:39,808
Those kids really did not know
a parent's love.

307
00:21:40,754 --> 00:21:43,883
You only need love in order to
develop as a person.

308
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:49,126
As you say, the orphanages of
the east side were quite horrible.

309
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:54,191
Even this place was once referred to
as Orphanage 47.

310
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:58,835
But we did what we could
so we wouldn't be controlled

311
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:01,984
by the government,
even just a little

312
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:04,978
in order to avoid becoming
like 511 Kinderheim.

313
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:08,943
It was a special orphanage
run by both

314
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:11,484
the Ministry of Health and Welfare
and the Ministry of the interior.

315
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,787
Do you know what that means?

316
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:15,188
No...

317
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:18,057
The real state of affairs
was being managed by

318
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:19,387
the Ministry of the interior.

319
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:25,297
That place was...East Germany's
experimental laboratory...
