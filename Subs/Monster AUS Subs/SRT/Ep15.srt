1
00:00:35,857 --> 00:00:37,086
I've never seen you before.

2
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:40,624
If you want to do business,
get permission from the state.

3
00:00:41,362 --> 00:00:43,023
Unlicensed prostitutes are a nuisance.

4
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:46,032
I can't make much money
if I do it legitimately.

5
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:48,429
Get out of here.

6
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:52,536
I just have to get permission
from him, don't I?

7
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:54,742
Let me meet him.

8
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:57,736
Him? What are you talking about?

9
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,473
I'll keep coming until you
let me meet him...

10
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:05,049
The man known as "The Baby."

11
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,875
You can't catch it with your hands.

12
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,578
You're not the goalkeeper.

13
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:48,322
I don't care about the rules!

14
00:02:48,956 --> 00:02:51,118
Where did he go?

15
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,426
He?

16
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,494
Tenma, Tenma!

17
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:59,729
He told me to stay with you until
he found the man he was looking for.

18
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:00,957
Me?!

19
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:02,967
He wants me to look after you?!

20
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:05,230
No way!

21
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:08,073
I hate kids!

22
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:09,476
Tenma, that bastard...

23
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,774
He doesn't give me any warning
and picks up some strange kid...

24
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:17,249
What happened to making money
as an unlicensed doctor?

25
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,188
Get a real job.

26
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:21,989
Pass!

27
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:23,885
Nice header!

28
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:25,590
Why you...

29
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:27,461
What do you think
you're doing, you brat?!

30
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:28,696
Hey...

31
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,164
I told you that you can't hold the ball
with your hands. That's a yellow card.

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,597
Shut up! You can't get through life
being worried about that!

33
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:37,803
If you say things like that,
you'll get a red card.

34
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:38,872
Shut up!

35
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:19,848
You're late... Quickly!
Give me the goods...

36
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:23,375
Give them to me now!

37
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:29,388
It's been a while, Detective Mesner.

38
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,688
D-Doctor Tenma...

39
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:35,794
That's right. That's what you
called me then.

40
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:37,555
It was the first time we met.

41
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:39,600
You hadn't even asked
what my occupation was.

42
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:43,568
But, right now, I'm an ex-doctor.

43
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:48,073
Come to think of it,
you're an ex-detective.

44
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:51,310
Detective dismissed on
suspicion of narcotics use."

45
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:55,713
I was surprised when I found
this six-month-old article.

46
00:04:58,653 --> 00:04:59,916
You'd better not stand up.

47
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,915
I'm pointing a gun at you
from under my coat.

48
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:10,162
W-What do you want–?

49
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:14,129
I want to know what you did
ten months ago in Heidelberg...

50
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:18,369
And who hired you to do that.

51
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:21,769
L-I don't know...

52
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,869
You took the lives of
the Fortners and Maurer!

53
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:29,777
I didn't do it! I was just a lookout!

54
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:32,380
My partner, Muller, did it.

55
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:36,151
Detective Muller also

56
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:38,192
quit the police immediately after
the incident, didn't he?

57
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:39,854
Y-Yeah...

58
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:44,097
It seems that he took his money
and is doing quite well...

59
00:05:44,632 --> 00:05:45,793
And you, on the other hand,

60
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,495
used up all of your money on drugs
and ended up like this?

61
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:53,367
He took the request. He did the killing.

62
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,705
He got the larger portion
of the reward!

63
00:05:57,111 --> 00:06:00,638
Someone even tried to kill me
to keep me silent...

64
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:03,648
I'm surprised you're still alive.

65
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:06,513
I was saved by a certain organization.

66
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:08,422
A certain organization?"

67
00:06:09,156 --> 00:06:13,252
That's enough, isn't it? Forgive me.
I've already spoken too much before.

68
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:15,162
Before? To whom?

69
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:17,760
Leave me alone already!

70
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,860
I don't have the time for that now!

71
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:23,067
Withdrawal symptoms, huh?

72
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:29,275
Drug dealers probably won't
approach you while I'm sitting here.

73
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,175
W-Well...

74
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:35,742
The Baby" saved me!

75
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:38,185
The Baby"?

76
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,454
Go to the pub called Candy.
You can meet him there.

77
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:44,085
Who is "The Baby"?

78
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,293
He's a big name right-wing extremist.

79
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:49,795
He's an executive of
two right-wing political parties...

80
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:51,798
After the Wall fell,

81
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,710
The Baby went to Dresden,
on the east side,

82
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:56,465
and tried to make a town
of only pure German people.

83
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,769
But he failed and he's come back.

84
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:02,801
Why did that man save you?

85
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:05,812
The darkness.

86
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:09,543
When the Berlin Wall fell...

87
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:12,045
A great darkness was born...

88
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:16,519
A monster...was born...

89
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,326
A monster?

90
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:22,959
Go already! I told the rest to that girl!

91
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:24,564
That girl?

92
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:27,364
She came for revenge
and pointed a gun at me!

93
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,165
She's the daughter of
the couple we killed!

94
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:32,272
Anna...

95
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:37,976
Nina, Nina Fortner came to you?!

96
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,540
L-I was told by "The Baby"...

97
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:45,374
that I was to send that girl to him
if she appeared!

98
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:50,186
He said that she's important bait...

99
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:54,593
important...bait?

100
00:07:58,632 --> 00:07:59,861
You again?

101
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:03,699
You appear every night.

102
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:09,132
I'll buy you for a good price...

103
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:12,239
You're the one that said that
I'd get in trouble

104
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:14,110
if I did business without permission
from The Baby.

105
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:15,840
What did you say?! Why you...

106
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:18,946
What's with that look?

107
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:26,017
Is that the girl that wants to
meet The Baby?

108
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,350
Oh...yes.

109
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:29,730
Right this way.

110
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,230
Right this way.

111
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:00,016
Please wait right there.

112
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:01,395
Huh?

113
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:03,829
Please wait on that symbol.

114
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,600
Oh. No, no... Right on there.

115
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:13,540
That's right.

116
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:47,636
Do you know this song?

117
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:53,875
Its pleasant rhythm will
carry you away, Miss Nina Fortner.

118
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,552
<i>The Baby said...</i>

119
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,087
<i>This country will be all right
when the second Hitler is born..."</i>

120
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,591
<i>That woman is the bait.</i>

121
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,468
Nina!

122
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:19,800
How do you know about me?

123
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:21,800
I know everything.

124
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:24,869
Your other name is Anna Liebert...

125
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:27,772
But neither is your real name.

126
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:30,327
Names don't really matter.

127
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:33,184
After all, I'm called "The Baby."

128
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:35,220
Come on, dance, dance!

129
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:38,721
I heard that you know
where my brother is.

130
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,523
Ah, Johan, huh? That's a good name.

131
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,397
You know, don't you?!

132
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:46,396
You went as far as to dress like that,

133
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:48,902
so what do you plan to do
once you do meet him?

134
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:55,205
I have to kill him.

135
00:10:56,277 --> 00:11:00,145
Don't wave that
dangerous thing around.

136
00:11:00,714 --> 00:11:05,584
It's all right.
Johan will come to meet you.

137
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:21,290
I lived in this area when I was a kid,
so I know all of the back alleys.

138
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:23,663
There's an antique dealer
further down.

139
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:26,166
I'm going to trade
this rug in for money.

140
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,610
What? You don't have
any money, Mr. Heckel?

141
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:35,407
Shut up. I'm trying to do something
to pay for your dinner... Be thankful...

142
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:37,908
Huh–?

143
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:44,017
Huh??

144
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,592
Huh?

145
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:46,785
Huh?

146
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,285
Whoa...

147
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:49,791
What's wrong?

148
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:53,525
This whole area's become
a Turkish district...

149
00:11:57,771 --> 00:11:59,535
This is a fake.

150
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:01,738
Wha?! What are you talking about?

151
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,671
This design, this feel...

152
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,572
No matter how you look at it,
this is hand woven silk.

153
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:07,276
This is synthetic.

154
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:10,876
Well, I feel sorry for you,
so I'll take it for 100 marks.

155
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:13,483
Aww...That's what I hate!

156
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:16,588
The previous German store owner
would have given me 10,000 marks.

157
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,588
Then take it with you.

158
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:23,496
You're going to beg me for it
when you realize it's real.

159
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:26,395
This is what you would call a real one.

160
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:27,601
Huh?

161
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:30,670
It's a 100 percent silk Hereke rug.

162
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:33,771
Take a close look.
No corners have been cut.

163
00:12:33,841 --> 00:12:35,206
Not even the fine patterns...

164
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:38,605
It's 150,000 marks.

165
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:41,372
L-It's probably a fake!

166
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:45,308
You can't even see that
this rug is real.

167
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:47,011
Let's go, Dieter.

168
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:55,486
Say, I'm hungry...

169
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:57,487
It's real...

170
00:12:57,965 --> 00:12:58,932
Huh?!

171
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,667
It's a genuine high quality rug.

172
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:03,637
150,000 marks, he says?

173
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:07,039
At the right place,
it can go for 800,000 marks.

174
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:09,386
Say, let's get something to eat.

175
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,377
Shut up!

176
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:14,238
If I get that, you can eat all you want!

177
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:17,641
Get it? How?

178
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,145
Just leave that to me.

179
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:25,157
What's with that look?

180
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:27,193
Thief!

181
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:30,295
Whoa, you idiot.
K-Keep your voice down, you brat.

182
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:40,572
Hold on, what are you planning to do?

183
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:43,209
Sorry, but try someone else
if you want a customer.

184
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:44,769
That's not what I meant.

185
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:49,374
An Asian like you might be killed
if you waltzed in there.

186
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,716
That store's a nest of right-wingers!

187
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:53,821
You're Turkish, aren't you?

188
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:56,685
Is it all right to be
doing business here?

189
00:13:57,157 --> 00:13:58,181
Don't be stupid!

190
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:00,257
I wouldn't think of doing business
in a dump like this!

191
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:05,056
Those guys took a friend of mine.

192
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:08,527
It seems like she found out
a secret of theirs...

193
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:09,936
A secret?

194
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,631
I don't know what it is.
But I have to save her quickly.

195
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:15,468
Who knows what
she's facing right now...

196
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:19,873
A woman I know is also in there.

197
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,281
What's she like?

198
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:23,945
Could it be the longhaired blond girl?

199
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:27,581
Who knows...? Who knows what
hairstyle she has right now...

200
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:30,889
They just took her away by car.

201
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:32,902
Where did they go?!

202
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:34,087
I don't know.

203
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,491
But The Baby was with them,

204
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:36,893
so they probably
went to his mansion...

205
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:38,098
The Baby!

206
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:40,266
What kind of car was it?!
What color was it?!

207
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:42,691
Uhh... It was a red Mercedes.

208
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:46,698
All right... I've got to find that car
and go after it.

209
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:50,106
Hey! Save my friend, too!

210
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:51,311
Please.

211
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:53,914
She has a small child!

212
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:55,281
Please!

213
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:17,163
Well, well, you didn't die!

214
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:20,632
Right this way.

215
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:25,275
Before that, I'll take your gun.

216
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:31,348
Go right ahead.

217
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:41,989
Sit wherever you like...

218
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:54,301
Are you the girl that
The Baby brought?

219
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:55,970
Let me see your face.

220
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:05,050
Oh...? You're a beautiful girl.
It's as I expected of Johan's sister.

221
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:18,125
I am Professor Geidlitz.

222
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:21,967
The man in the picture
with Johan is General Wolf.

223
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:23,868
There are two others...

224
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:28,039
Together, the four of us
created this organization.

225
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:31,969
Would you like some fruit?

226
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:34,880
Let me meet my brother...Johan.

227
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:41,182
You'll meet him... He'll show up
once he knows that you're here.

228
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:43,681
He needs you.

229
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:46,889
You don't know where
Johan is either, do you?

230
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,487
We need him...

231
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,898
In order to lead us.

232
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:02,203
Do you know why Hitler
had so much power?

233
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:05,038
He was an intelligent businessman.

234
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:07,404
He knew the three essentials.

235
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:15,951
Control the banks,
stimulate the munitions industry,

236
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:18,047
and seize the military.

237
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,853
Right now, Johan is secretly
gaining power in one of those...

238
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:27,365
Do you think that
my reasoning is correct?

239
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,667
What do you plan to do with Johan?

240
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:35,240
However, Hitler achieved what he did
through his charisma.

241
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:38,788
Hitler failed
his art school examination.

242
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:41,042
Even in the military, he only made it
as far as corporal...

243
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:46,142
He became charismatic
once he passed his thirties...

244
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,484
But what about Johan?

245
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:53,853
He's had a monstrous charisma
since he was a child.

246
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:57,191
It's as if he were Jesus Christ.

247
00:17:58,031 --> 00:18:00,398
But you mustn't forget

248
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:04,597
the three wise men from the east
and John the Baptist;

249
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,198
the four amazing people
who first realized Christ's talents.

250
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:14,214
We four have been paying attention to
Johan's talents since he was a child.

251
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:16,238
Isn't it wonderful?

252
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:18,643
What should I do?

253
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:21,753
We want you to stay here
for a while...

254
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:25,017
Until Johan comes to meet you...

255
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:32,155
Don't try to run away.
You've already gone too far.

256
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:35,961
There's no need to worry.
I wanted to come here...

257
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,167
I'll wait here for Johan!

258
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:40,540
That's fine...

259
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:44,334
Now, have some fruit...

260
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:57,689
It seems like you've
regained consciousness.

261
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:03,495
There's no need to worry.
We won't break any of your bones...

262
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:09,225
What were you doing around here,
Doctor Tenma?

263
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:12,129
H-How do you know who I am?

264
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:16,033
I'm asking the questions.

265
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:18,434
You just have to answer them.

266
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,138
What are you planning to do?

267
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:24,342
What do you plan to do
once you find Johan?

268
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:26,246
Where is Nina?

269
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:30,453
I said that I'm asking the questions!

270
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:32,152
What do you plan to do with Nina?

271
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,550
I thought I told you
not to ask questions!

272
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:41,767
Nina is an important guest.
Not trash like you.

273
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:44,066
Then...she's safe, right?

274
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:48,031
For now...
But she's very dangerous...

275
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:52,375
She has such a cute face,
but is trying to kill Johan...

276
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:56,074
We'll eventually have to
deal with people like that...

277
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:59,582
So Nina is just a tool
in order to call Johan?!

278
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:03,049
Who are you? What do you plan to...

279
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:09,285
Another question. Foreigners like you
have no right to question us!

280
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:14,157
The whole district is going to burn
because of your impudent attitude.

281
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:22,902
T-The whole district?

282
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:28,611
That's right... Tomorrow night,
the night sky will be beautiful...

283
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:36,722
I can meet Johan if I stay here...

284
00:21:17,597 --> 00:21:18,564
Help...

285
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,000
Help...

286
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:24,397
W-Who are you?

287
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:26,200
H-Help...

288
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,465
Where are you?

289
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:30,376
Third floor...

290
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:35,578
You speak in broken German.

291
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:37,216
What country are you from?

292
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:39,385
Turkey...

293
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:41,417
I'm...going to be killed...

294
00:21:42,455 --> 00:21:44,116
I've got to escape...

295
00:21:44,658 --> 00:21:46,717
You've been confined
by the people here, haven't you?

296
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:48,694
Help...

297
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:53,229
But... I've got to stay here...

298
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:55,397
Please, help.

299
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:59,230
If I don't let everyone know soon,
my baby will die, as well...

300
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:06,675
Tomorrow night we'll have a party
to welcome Johan.

301
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,077
Only superior people, like us,
should survive in this world.

302
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:15,245
All the rest should burn.

303
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:20,592
I heard them talking...

304
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:24,588
They're going to set a fire
tomorrow night...

305
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:28,192
They plan on burning
the Turkish district!

306
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:30,469
Help!

307
00:22:31,404 --> 00:22:32,462
Help!
