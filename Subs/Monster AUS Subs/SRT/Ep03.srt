1
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:27,214
Yes...?

2
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:30,807
Sorry for calling on you so early.
I'm from the state police.

3
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:32,918
Are you Dr. Tenma?

4
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:37,391
What can I do for you?

5
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:40,522
Excuse me, but were you at home
all night?

6
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:44,428
No... I was out drinking
until it was nearly morning...

7
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,100
What about it?

8
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:47,144
The truth is,

9
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:49,747
Eisler Memorial Hospital's
Director Heinemann;

10
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:55,642
Chief of Surgery, Dr. Oppenheim,
and Dr. Boyer are dead.

11
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:31,166
In any case, no one except the police
are allowed at the scene of the crime!

12
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,606
Even so, you are obstructing
the operations of the hospital.

13
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,698
The Press is not allowed

14
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:35,867
inside the hospital!
-Please don't do anything

15
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:37,721
to excite the patients!

16
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:40,214
Was it an accident?
Or was it murder?

17
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:43,375
Three people died at the same time!
Of course it was murder!

18
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:45,586
Are you from the hospital?

19
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:48,281
Do you know anything
about this incident?

20
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:50,085
Out of my way!
Let me through!

21
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,020
Hey! No one is allowed in!

22
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,428
I'm Dr. Kenzo Tenma of this hospital!

23
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,823
Oh...go right ahead.
Hey! Don't push!

24
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:59,843
So, did you see anyone suspicious?

25
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:00,978
Wait a minute.
Now is not the time...

26
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:02,663
Now is not the time...
-Dr. Tenma!

27
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:05,282
Dr. Tenma! The Director!

28
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:06,330
Doctor!

29
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:09,240
Everyone, calm down!
Are the emergencies taken care of?

30
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,936
W-Well, even at this time...

31
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:13,276
there's been no end
to the emergencies.

32
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:15,141
There are two patients
waiting to be operated on...

33
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,248
I understand. I'll help out!

34
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:20,186
Take care of the car accident victim
with the brain contusion.

35
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,383
I'll go to the X-ray Reading Room
to look at the x-rays first.

36
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:23,791
What about the other case?

37
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:25,584
A patient who collapsed due to a stroke.

38
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:28,956
Oh, Doctor, will you help us
in our investigation?

39
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,591
Now is not the time...

40
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:33,592
I know that,
but the initial investigation is vital!

41
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:37,503
Do you know of anyone with a grudge
against the director and the others?

42
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:39,506
A grudge...?

43
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:41,819
<i>You may consider your path
to becoming</i>

44
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:43,607
<i>the doctor you envisioned closed.</i>

45
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:48,816
Huh...? Do you know something?

46
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,677
Oh... No.

47
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:52,219
Dr. Tenma!

48
00:03:52,553 --> 00:03:56,717
Trouble! Those kids...
The twin brother and sister...

49
00:03:58,659 --> 00:03:59,922
We can't find them anywhere!

50
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:13,283
Is the sister's bed empty, too?

51
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:15,366
I looked!
But they're nowhere to be found...

52
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:18,679
<i>What's going on...?</i>

53
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:22,443
<i>What in the world has happened...?</i>

54
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:31,487
...compassionately extended
a helping hand.

55
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:36,189
We will surely praise his lifetime
of achievements through eternity.

56
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:42,001
Farewell Dr. Heinemann.
Rest in peace. Amen.

57
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:45,197
Father...

58
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:52,903
Eva...
-Eva.

59
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:55,610
I know it's difficult,
but pull yourself together...

60
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:56,683
Let me go!

61
00:04:57,118 --> 00:05:01,055
Give back my father!
Father!

62
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:13,259
It's just too much, Dr. Tenma.

63
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:14,935
Yeah...

64
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:18,229
Up until now, she lived an easy life
as the director's daughter...

65
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:21,275
Now suddenly,
she's just an ordinary person.

66
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,534
It must be a big shock...

67
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:25,270
How can you say that
at a time like this?

68
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:26,680
Oh, pardon me.

69
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:28,783
You're Dr. Tenma, aren't you?

70
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:31,649
I am Detective Visbaugh

71
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:34,188
Of the Nordhein-Westfalen
Police Department.

72
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:35,556
Thank you for your efforts.

73
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:37,388
This was such a tragic incident...

74
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:38,692
Yes...

75
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:41,051
Let me introduce you. This is...

76
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:44,758
I am Inspector Lunge of the BKA.

77
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:48,068
I've heard rumors that
you are a brilliant physician.

78
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:51,399
Not at all. I've still got
a long ways to go.

79
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:59,880
Um... Have you any idea
where the children are?

80
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:01,558
Never mind them.

81
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:02,913
We have determined what caused

82
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,452
the death of the director
and the other two.

83
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:09,020
We found a nitrate type poison
in their bodies.

84
00:06:09,557 --> 00:06:12,720
Nitrates...
That means a muscular relaxant...

85
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:15,558
As expected of a doctor.
You are knowledgeable...

86
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,661
But how could something like that...

87
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:19,132
It was candy.

88
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:21,068
Candy?!

89
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:25,833
The same candy wrapper
was found beside each body,

90
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:28,274
and the same candy was found
in their stomachs.

91
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:31,288
By the way...

92
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:34,391
Would you have any idea
where the three of them

93
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:35,780
might get a hold of
something like that?

94
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:41,685
I don't know anything about that.
What about the search for the twins?

95
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:46,984
The BKA has
taken over the investigation.

96
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:48,489
Don't worry about it.

97
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,108
This incident may have started

98
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:55,262
when the parents of those twins
were shot and killed.

99
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:57,798
Their parents defected
from East Germany

100
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:59,771
and were killed by someone.

101
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,604
Then, the director and doctors
of the hospital

102
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:03,542
where the children were taken to
were killed.

103
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:06,338
There is also the possibility
that this is political terrorism.

104
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:10,312
Those children might be
holding a major clue.

105
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:13,852
Please.
Please find them.

106
00:07:14,355 --> 00:07:15,550
We will do our best.

107
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,157
Then...

108
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:26,428
Before the incident, the Director
removed him from his position as Chief.

109
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,164
Furthermore, the Director's daughter
broke off her engagement to him...

110
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:34,440
But he was in a bar drinking
at the time of the incident.

111
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:35,475
He has an alibi...

112
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,373
Umm...
May I ask you something?

113
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:42,472
Why do you move
your hand like that...?

114
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:46,547
Huh?
Oh, I'm typing.

115
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:47,788
What?

116
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:51,849
I'm inputting all the information into
the disk in my head.

117
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,489
When I press the key
to extract the information...

118
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,598
Not at all. I still have
a long ways to go."

119
00:07:58,532 --> 00:08:04,437
That's what Dr. Tenma bashfully said
when I called him brilliant.

120
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,243
The police...? Do they suspect you
of doing something?

121
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,340
It's because there's enough evidence
for me to be a suspect.

122
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,317
Don't worry about it.

123
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:19,551
They were quite persistent
when they questioned me, too.

124
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,657
I'm exhausted...

125
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:28,554
When the dust from this thing settles,
I think I'll go back to Japan...

126
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:32,126
What?
-I came to Germany to do research,

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,764
but due to the recent chain of events,

128
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:38,737
I feel like I've gone back to saving lives,
the true duty of a doctor.

129
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:41,974
Hey, don't be so depressing.

130
00:08:43,878 --> 00:08:44,936
I'm tired...

131
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,578
I'm just so tired...

132
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,852
Your progress is favorable,
Mr. Buchner.

133
00:08:55,489 --> 00:09:01,038
Thank you, Dr. Tenma.
Do you think I can work again?

134
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,325
Yes, of course.

135
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:06,199
My store will go under
if I'm not there.

136
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:08,532
But you mustn't overdo it.

137
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,136
I'll go have a drink there
after you're released.

138
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,933
I'll be there to make sure
you don't overdo things.

139
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:16,537
Dr. Tenma

140
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:17,811
Yes?

141
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:20,108
I heard that you were
leaving this hospital.

142
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:21,438
Is that true?

143
00:09:21,982 --> 00:09:22,949
What?

144
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:25,715
Please don't quit.

145
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:28,745
There aren't any
good doctors like you.

146
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:31,719
Please don't say you're quitting.

147
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,326
Please.

148
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,657
Mr. Buchner...

149
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:44,672
Dr. Tenma, the Chairman
is asking for you.

150
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:49,468
The board is discussing who should
succeed to the empty posts.

151
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:53,570
Up until now, the Director's faction
has filled the major positions...

152
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,076
There will be a considerable
purging of personnel.

153
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:59,186
The rumor is Dr. Eckner
is being transferred

154
00:09:59,286 --> 00:10:01,482
to a small hospital in Bavaria.

155
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:03,983
Is that so...
-Umm, Dr. Tenma!

156
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:07,054
Huh?
-No matter what the Chairman says,

157
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,095
please don't give up!

158
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,093
We're all behind you!

159
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:12,596
Please don't leave this hospital!

160
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,207
Huh?

161
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,906
I'll say it again.
I am performance orientated.

162
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:28,311
Dr. Tenma, you are appointed to
Chief of Surgery.

163
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,422
<i>What a life...</i>

164
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:42,839
<i>I went against the orders
of the Director,</i>

165
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:44,641
<i>lost my position as Chief,</i>

166
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:46,497
<i>and my engagement to Eva
was dissolved.</i>

167
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:49,996
<i>As soon as I decide to work
as a simple doctor</i>

168
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,731
<i>without any hope of promotion...</i>

169
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:03,675
W-What a life!

170
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:17,161
I'm sorry for calling you out.

171
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,795
I heard you've been appointed
Chief of Surgery. That's very good.

172
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:24,571
Thank you...

173
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:31,301
Kenzo... At my father's funeral,
you tried to comfort me, didn't you?

174
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,213
Oh...not really...

175
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:35,415
It made me happy...

176
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:40,121
A lot of things happened between us,
but I'd like to try again.

177
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:49,329
Kenzo!

178
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:52,098
Kenzo!

179
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,234
Please! I was wrong...!

180
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:56,934
I want to try again!

181
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:00,663
Kenzo...

182
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:04,075
Kenzo!

183
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:13,280
The patient hospitalized
for a spinal cord tumor...

184
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:16,447
His paralysis has accelerated.

185
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:19,388
I understand.
I'll perform the operation.

186
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:21,655
If you will, Chief of Surgery.

187
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,761
Make the arrangements
for the operation.

188
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:26,299
Yes, sir!

189
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:32,702
Honestly, when will this flood recede...?

190
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,702
I thought the world would change

191
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:37,868
when the Berlin Wall came down
six years ago,

192
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:39,276
but nothing good has happened.

193
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,879
Even with the unification of Europe,

194
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:44,475
hopeless people from all over
come flowing in.

195
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:48,511
Yeah. There's been an increase in
unexplainable crimes.

196
00:12:48,956 --> 00:12:49,923
Oops...

197
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:53,293
Inspector, we've arrived.

198
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:58,824
Both victims had their throats
slit open with a knife.

199
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,266
Their identities?

200
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,763
The Reichmanns of Stich Drive

201
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,170
They were murdered in their home.

202
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:08,084
We believe that they were
hidden in a closet,

203
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:10,873
and their bodies floated out
because of the flood.

204
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:13,970
A murder of a middle-aged couple.

205
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:16,074
There have been four incidents
in Germany

206
00:13:16,183 --> 00:13:17,480
over the past two years.

207
00:13:17,718 --> 00:13:18,981
All by the same method.

208
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,248
It's probably a robber who targets
rich middle-aged couples.

209
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:26,259
No, it's too soon
to call them robberies.

210
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,993
According to the data,
for some reason,

211
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:31,497
all of the couples
did not have children.

212
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:34,401
This couple certainly
did not have any children.

213
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:38,303
Don't you think there are
too many similarities

214
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,203
to call them robberies?

215
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:44,603
But money and goods have been
taken from all of the victims' homes...

216
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:46,811
All of them totaling very little.

217
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:50,515
It would make sense
if a single perpetrator did it.

218
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:53,383
Are you suggesting that
there wasn't a single perpetrator?

219
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:58,084
Two of the homes had
extremely strong locks and alarms.

220
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:02,557
But the perpetrator opened them
and entered very easily.

221
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:06,976
Also, all the couples did not seem to
fight back when they were killed

222
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,664
and the neighbors did not hear
any noise at the time of the incidents.

223
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:12,882
Don't you think they were
too skillfully done

224
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,567
for it to have been done by
a single individual?

225
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:18,474
Do you know this man?

226
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:19,989
No.

227
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:21,777
Adolph Junkers, 32 years old.

228
00:14:22,683 --> 00:14:24,777
He has been convicted twice
for larceny.

229
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:29,487
His role was to open locks...
In other words, he's a lock picker.

230
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:32,754
He was seen near the scene

231
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,386
of three of the murders
of middle-aged couples.

232
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:37,058
Then did this man do it?

233
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,197
I can't say.

234
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:44,060
Well, that's the extent
of your work as state police.

235
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:47,505
Leave the rest to the BKA.

236
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:49,200
Uh...yeah...

237
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:55,525
Oh!

238
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:59,782
It didn't fly after all.
I've never flown a kite before.

239
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,545
It almost went up.

240
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:04,417
Well, how was the girl last night?

241
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:07,023
How was she?
She was a nice person.

242
00:15:07,494 --> 00:15:09,326
Hey, hey, she's the daughter
of a director, you know.

243
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:12,859
Don't tell me you just had dinner
and saw her home.

244
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,279
Well, there was an emergency call
during dinner,

245
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:17,930
so I had to come back to the hospital.

246
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:23,066
What's that?! You'd better rethink that
all work and no play doctrine!

247
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,641
You're going to lose a great catch
and regret it some day!

248
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:29,148
Hey! Are you listening,
Chief of Surgery?!

249
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:30,683
A kite...?

250
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:32,980
Good morning, Chief.

251
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,687
Is that yours, Karl?

252
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:38,783
My grandpa gave it to me,
but it just won't fly...

253
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:41,461
Could it be it's unbalanced?

254
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:44,196
Chief, can you fly a kite?

255
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:47,191
I did it often during my childhood in
Japan.

256
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:51,704
Try holding it up high, Karl.

257
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:53,798
Like this?

258
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,375
That's right.
Now...will it work?

259
00:15:57,945 --> 00:15:59,310
Heave ho!
-There!

260
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,147
There we go!

261
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,057
It's flying!

262
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:17,864
I did it!

263
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:19,723
Oh, my...

264
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,628
If I were in his shoes,
I'd have at least five lovers.

265
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:25,872
Honestly...

266
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:28,174
That's amazing, Dr. Tenma.

267
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:33,073
Get well quickly
and fly it yourself, Karl.

268
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:34,481
Yeah!

269
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:46,153
Today's surgery is
a parasellar meningioma extirpation.

270
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:48,793
We'll proceed with
a right pterional approach.

271
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:50,163
Yes!

272
00:16:50,397 --> 00:16:54,391
Watch closely. Chief Tenma
will perform the surgery himself.

273
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:56,064
What a splendid operation.

274
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:58,601
He's hardly retracted the brain at all!

275
00:16:59,406 --> 00:17:01,306
He truly is a surgical genius.

276
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,106
You residents should treat the brain
with tender care.

277
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,043
Always keep this in mind.

278
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:31,070
Huh?

279
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:46,986
This is terrible!

280
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:49,146
Look at the blood!
-Ambulance! Call an ambulance!

281
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:52,453
I-I didn't do it!
It's not my fault.

282
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:55,691
This man ran into the street suddenly!

283
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:00,593
This is the patient?

284
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:02,302
Yes.

285
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:03,446
How is his condition?

286
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,134
Well, I can't say...
There's nothing more we can do...

287
00:18:07,874 --> 00:18:09,740
He's a material witness
in a certain case.

288
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:15,046
His testimony alone
could solve a serial murder case.

289
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:17,715
We can't have him die.

290
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:21,013
But the patient is
in a very critical condition.

291
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:23,716
Nothing more can be done
at our hospital...

292
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,153
There's a terrific brain surgeon
at Eisler Memorial Hospital.

293
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:30,357
If he came...

294
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:32,823
Brain surgeon...

295
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:35,762
You mean Dr. Tenma...

296
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:43,370
Thank you for coming all this way,
Dr. Tenma.

297
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,777
How is the patient's condition?

298
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:49,649
He is in a coma.
And one of his pupils is dilated.

299
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,975
It's been a long time, Dr. Tenma.

300
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:56,879
Um...I'm sorry,
but who are you?

301
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,626
It's been nine years.
Not since the Director's funeral...

302
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:03,128
If I'm not mistaken,
you're with the BKA.

303
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:04,321
Inspector Lunge.

304
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:09,732
Please make this operation a success
for the sake of the BKA.

305
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,137
Huh?

306
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:16,539
The patient has to live.
He holds the key to solving a big case.

307
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:19,712
I don't operate
for the sake of the police.

308
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,511
I do it for the sake of the patient.

309
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,010
That's fine...

310
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:26,446
Well, I have an operation to perform...

311
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:32,257
I hear you've become
the Chief of Surgery, Dr. Tenma.

312
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:35,159
You've been very successful...

313
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:37,130
Is there a problem?

314
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:40,259
No. At your age,
it's quite an accomplishment.

315
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:42,728
Aren't you in line
to become the next Director?

316
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:45,529
No, that would be
a long way off for me.

317
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:48,770
About the murders
at the Eisler Memorial Hospital...

318
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,171
There is very little evidence.

319
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,075
The investigation
has been extremely difficult.

320
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:56,046
The only clue is the poisoned candy.

321
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:59,652
The methodology means
it is an intelligent crime.

322
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,181
An intelligent crime means

323
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:06,487
the victim and the assailant
have some sort of interests at stake

324
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:08,557
What are you trying to tell me?

325
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:15,000
No, excuse me. In this business,
I'm constantly thinking like this.

326
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:17,361
In any case, rest assured.

327
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:21,602
All the cases I've ever handled
have been solved.

328
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:23,710
Every single one.

329
00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:26,904
I hope so.

330
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:37,881
We will perform a craniotomy
to remove the hematoma.

331
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:41,419
We must hurry. There is the danger
of the brain hernia worsening.

332
00:20:45,832 --> 00:20:48,824
No matter how you look at it,

333
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:54,032
only one person greatly benefited from
the Eisler Memorial Hospital murders.

334
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:59,337
That is you, Dr. Tenma.

335
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:08,848
Thank you for taking the trouble
to come here.

336
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:11,289
Not at all. How has
the patient been doing?

337
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:15,455
He's conscious,
but his right pupil remains dilated...

338
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,594
And he has some paralysis
on the left side.

339
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:22,164
He's started rehab already, hasn't he?
The paralysis should go away.

340
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:23,703
He's recovering normally.

341
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:28,404
Also, the police will want to see him,
but please refuse for now.

342
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:31,907
But, that detective, Lunge,
is so persistent...

343
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:34,605
Right now, the patient's recovery
is most important.

344
00:21:43,156 --> 00:21:45,523
How are you feeling, Mr. Junkers?

345
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:51,593
Mr. Junkers, do you recognize me?

346
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:53,995
Can you see this finger?

347
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,129
How about it? Can you answer me?

348
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,877
What's that...?

349
00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:07,779
The monster...is coming...

350
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:10,580
What's that, Mr. Junkers?

351
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:15,685
The monster...is coming...

352
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:18,487
Coming...? What's coming?

353
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:21,156
The monster is coming...

354
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:28,167
The monster...is coming...

355
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:32,004
The monster?!
