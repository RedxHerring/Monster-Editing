1
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:12,229
Here you go...your Manhattan.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,696
Hey, what about my red cherry?

3
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:15,936
Huh?

4
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:19,402
There should be a red cherry in it,
or it isn't a Manhattan!

5
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,676
S-Sorry about that.

6
00:00:22,343 --> 00:00:23,708
Humph! You'd better watch it.

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,884
My business goes well
when I have this in my mouth.

8
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,223
Huh?

9
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:38,922
It's a jinx, a jinx!

10
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:18,518
Please...

11
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:22,028
Let there still be something
of value left!

12
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:34,370
Okay, okay... It's just as I thought...

13
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:38,239
Everything's right here;
like a candy store.

14
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:42,683
Is there anything
valuable enough for me?

15
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,250
Life is fleeting. He may have been
touted as a candidate for governor,

16
00:02:49,323 --> 00:02:51,451
but when he and his wife
were gunned down together like this...

17
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:54,220
Oops, I'd better get down
to business...

18
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,497
I figure the safe must be
in this room...

19
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:08,674
Wh-Wh-Wh-What's with this chill?!

20
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:11,035
It's the first time
I've felt anything so repulsive...

21
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,415
Someone's in this room...

22
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:22,848
No way! What am I so scared about?
It's not like me...

23
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:23,891
Don't move!

24
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:26,258
Raise your hands over your head!

25
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:31,029
Oh, no... He was behind me. Crap...

26
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:34,428
It's all because that bartender
forgot the cherry...

27
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,062
Hurry up and raise your hands!

28
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:38,299
All right, all right...

29
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:43,176
Give me a break, officer.
I haven't taken anything yet.

30
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:44,779
I'm not the police.

31
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:47,281
Huh? What the...? You're one of us?

32
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:50,950
In that case, why don't you
put that scary thing away and...

33
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:52,213
Put your hands on your head!!

34
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:54,819
What's with this guy?

35
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:57,081
He seems harder to deal with
than the police.

36
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:01,954
L-It's the cops!
You fouled up, didn't you?!

37
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:03,155
I'm getting outta here!

38
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,062
Don't follow me!

39
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,098
Somebody like you
will just slow me down!

40
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:09,731
Damn you!

41
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:12,865
Don't follow me, I said!

42
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,532
Damn! This is just not my day!

43
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,941
That's right...
I thought you looked familiar...

44
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,276
You're the guy in the newspaper...

45
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:25,043
You're the doctor who's
the "person of interest"

46
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:27,417
in the Councilman Springer
murder case.

47
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:28,614
And you're a thief?

48
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,023
Exactly! Unlike you, I wouldn't do
anything senseless like killing.

49
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:35,956
Do you know anything about the killing
that took place in that house?

50
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:39,866
No idea. Hurry up and get out
of my face, will you? So long.

51
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:46,133
Hey, Doctor!

52
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:49,941
You're supposed to be
a top-notch surgeon, aren't you?

53
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:53,211
My brilliant brain just came up
with an idea.

54
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:57,251
Do you think that meetings
happen by chance, Doctor?

55
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:58,815
They don't, you know.

56
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:02,082
All meetings between people
are determined beforehand...

57
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,582
You and I were destined
to become a team.

58
00:05:05,793 --> 00:05:06,760
Huh?

59
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:11,856
The underworld is full of people
who need someone like you;

60
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,230
people who want to call a doctor,

61
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:15,895
but die because
the danger is too great.

62
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:19,239
Leave the management
to me...Heckel!

63
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,501
I'll make you into the best doctor
of the underworld.

64
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,006
You'd make a whole lot more
in the underworld.

65
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,443
You'll be a billionaire
before you know it...

66
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:30,542
H-Hey, Doctor! Where are you going?

67
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:33,680
There's something I have to do.

68
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:35,981
Wait a minute!

69
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:39,057
You want to know about the murders
in that house, don't you?

70
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:40,260
Huh?

71
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:43,929
Well, I saw the killer, you see...

72
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:45,299
What's that?!

73
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:48,312
What are you talking about?!

74
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:49,428
You want to know?

75
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:53,140
Wasn't he blond
and about 20 years old?

76
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:54,599
What do you mean?

77
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:57,340
Anyway, just tell me about that killer!

78
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:00,142
I'll tell you if you'll team up with me.

79
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,779
He's on the third floor
of this cheap apartment house.

80
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:07,321
How do you know this?

81
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,017
After I set my sights
on that councilman's house,

82
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:11,889
I spent about a month researching it.

83
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:14,924
Just when I was set to go,
that guy showed up.

84
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:16,792
When I looked in the window,

85
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:18,923
the councilman
and his wife were dead.

86
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,731
I figured I could squeeze some money
out of the killer, so I followed him.

87
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:27,630
Well, this proves that
you're innocent in this case.

88
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:30,038
Go phone it in to the police
if that's what you want.

89
00:06:30,878 --> 00:06:32,937
Then you and I can go somewhere

90
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:36,712
and sit and talk over a drink
about our dream-like future...

91
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:37,918
H-Hey!

92
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:41,383
What do you want to see him for?

93
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:44,887
He's a murderer, you know!
You'll get yourself killed!

94
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:48,292
What is he thinking?!
I can't keep up with him!

95
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:56,563
But it's not often I'll find
a source of revenue like him.

96
00:06:58,272 --> 00:07:01,242
I make it a rule not to
stick my neck out, but...

97
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:25,299
Hey...

98
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:30,735
It's another hot day, isn't it?

99
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,001
Actually, I'm looking for
a certain person...

100
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:39,910
Hey, Doctor, are you alive?

101
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:42,749
Doctor...

102
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:46,815
You fool! He's got a gun!

103
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:51,057
I often used to go walking
with my mother...

104
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:52,826
Huh?

105
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:57,553
...along the sunflower field...
on summer days like this.

106
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:01,727
Of course, she died a long time ago.

107
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:08,339
Didn't you use that gun
at someone's request? Some man...

108
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:14,039
Man...? Oh... One day,
he approached in a bar.

109
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:16,717
A blond man, about 20 years old?

110
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:17,918
Huh?

111
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:22,149
That's right. He had a beautiful smile,
that Erich.

112
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:24,888
So he's Erich, now...

113
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:29,189
We met a few times
and became good friends.

114
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:34,735
He invited me to his home...
to Councilman Springer's home.

115
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:37,397
He lived in that mansion
until recently?

116
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:43,376
Yes. He said they took good care of him,
like a son, since about a year ago.

117
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:46,845
Hey, I had my eye on that home
for a month,

118
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:48,177
but I never saw anybody like that.

119
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:52,317
They were a wonderful family.
Here's a picture...

120
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:54,682
That's me and the Councilman
and his wife.

121
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,390
But there was something
I just couldn't forgive them for.

122
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:05,930
There was a bed of sunflowers
on their property,

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,937
but he tore it up in order to
build a parking area.

124
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:15,803
When I said that was
an awful thing to do, Erich agreed.

125
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:19,636
Y-You don't mean
you killed them over that!

126
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:24,181
Besides, Erich told me...

127
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,811
that Councilman Springer
had a mistress.

128
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:30,021
He also said this.

129
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:34,824
I no longer want to be
a member of the Springers' family.

130
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:41,730
I'm not a member of that family."
Then he asked me to...

131
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:45,096
Please eliminate that family."

132
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,608
He's terrible to have a mistress...

133
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:53,776
My mother was
someone's mistress, too.

134
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:56,816
L-Listen...never mind that.

135
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:59,213
Do you know where the safe is,
in that house?

136
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,846
I believe it's in the back of the study
on the 2nd floor.

137
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:04,723
O-Okay!

138
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,687
Doctor, you'd better get out
of here fast, too!

139
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:14,900
Did you know...?
You can erase the past.

140
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:19,502
If you don't like it,
you can erase everything...

141
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:22,872
You can reset your life.

142
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:29,413
I don't think so. You may try to forget,
but you cannot erase your past!

143
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:33,078
That's right...

144
00:10:34,555 --> 00:10:37,149
I wonder why I thought that...

145
00:10:37,858 --> 00:10:39,155
Why did I think at that time that

146
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:42,787
I could erase the past
by pulling this trigger?

147
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:47,224
I wonder why I listened
to his request...

148
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:54,473
That's all I have to say. Please leave.

149
00:10:58,646 --> 00:10:59,704
Oh, yes...

150
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:04,341
You're Dr. Tenma, aren't you?

151
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:09,850
Please look at the message.
It's a message for you, from him...

152
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,353
You'll find it in the study of that house.

153
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:13,493
What...?!

154
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:17,289
He knew that you would come here.

155
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:23,169
Erich said,
"Your destiny is already determined."

156
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:25,495
Good-bye...

157
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:29,843
Doctor!

158
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:34,246
I told you, didn't I? Oh...

159
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,777
D-Don't tell me you...

160
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:41,511
Oh, this is a suicide.

161
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:43,690
What the hell...?!

162
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:52,459
What's the use in dying?

163
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,629
It's all over when you die.

164
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,999
There's nothing like living,
right, Doctor?

165
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah... You sometimes say
something worthwhile, don't you?

166
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:03,270
What do you mean, sometimes?!

167
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:09,581
And so...you're after that unbelievable
serial killer named Johan?

168
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:12,418
Why don't you forget about doing
something so stupid,

169
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:13,647
and team up with me.

170
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:20,494
Oh... By the way, when I tried to open
this door earlier, I got the chills...

171
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:38,478
What's this?

172
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,975
What are you shivering for, Doctor?

173
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:49,455
"Look at me! Look at me!

174
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:55,292
"See how big the monster inside of me
has grown, Dr. Tenma..."

175
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:59,965
Johan is... He is enjoying himself.

176
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:05,535
Hey, Doctor!!

177
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:10,904
Wait a minute! Listen to me!!
Hey, Doctor!

178
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:16,472
I offered you a great deal.
You should be grateful.

179
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:18,784
You promised to team up
with me, right?

180
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:20,781
Who said I'd team up with you?!

181
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:27,391
Hey! You need money in order
to run from the cops, right?

182
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:35,258
Get in the car!

183
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:40,438
This is your client.
He'll take you to your patient.

184
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,209
I'll hold on to your things.

185
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:48,012
If you want them back,
you'd better do your job, get paid,

186
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:50,244
and come to Frank's place
on Grasten Street.

187
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,212
So long. You'd better earn all you can!

188
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,991
This is a really profitable business.

189
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:04,926
Now, then... Since I got an advance,
I guess I'll have a drink.

190
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:12,071
Counselor... I brought you a doctor.

191
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:22,112
Thank goodness, Doctor... Hurry...
Please stop the bleeding.

192
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:27,884
Your axillary artery
has been damaged.

193
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:29,787
Did you get hit by a shotgun?

194
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,483
Yeah... Hey, Doctor,
you're empty-handed.

195
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:35,820
Did you get the surgical equipment?

196
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:38,991
No. It was too dangerous in the city...
I didn't get that far...

197
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:43,738
I couldn't operate on you here
even if I had the equipment.

198
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:47,501
You'd better get him to
a proper doctor as soon as possible.

199
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:50,566
I would have done that if I could!
Hurry up and fix him!

200
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:52,643
How long ago was he shot?

201
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:54,538
Never mind the questions!

202
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:03,018
Four hours ago...?

203
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:06,286
Were you responsible for
the terrorist attack this morning?!

204
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:08,720
What if we are?

205
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,197
I refuse!

206
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:12,232
Wha...?!

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,058
What did you say?!

208
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:16,727
I have no desire
to treat anyone responsible

209
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:17,794
for indiscriminate terrorist attacks!

210
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:22,575
Don't get funny! Do you realize
the situation you're in now?

211
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:24,572
Wait a minute.

212
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,809
Listen, Doc... Our friends will be
coming to help us soon.

213
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,543
Just stop the bleeding by then,
will you?

214
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:39,753
What's with that attitude?!
Do you want to die?

215
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:41,652
I told you to wait up.

216
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:43,389
B-But...Counselor...

217
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:48,257
This doctor has my life
in his hands now...

218
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:52,538
If I should die...
I want you to shoot him.

219
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:59,278
We're not running a charity here,
you know.

220
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:03,316
Pay us back the 250,000 marks
we lent you, will you, Heckel?

221
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,215
Mr. Gross... I do intend
to pay you back...

222
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:10,119
That's nice. I'm glad you feel that way.

223
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:14,517
Just break both his arms for now.

224
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,899
I understand! I'll pay you back! I will!

225
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:20,123
Good boy...

226
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:22,566
So, please wait another month...
-In the random automatic rifle shooting

227
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:23,967
Break both legs, too.
-by terrorists this morning

228
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:27,234
in Erfurt Station, witness accounts
have helped police identify

229
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:31,904
the suspects as Max Steindorf
and Karl Blunt.

230
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:34,038
Please wait... Huh?!
-The GWE has announced

231
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:36,446
that it will give anyone
with promising leads on these two

232
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:39,077
a reward of 300,000 marks.

233
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:41,886
So, they were the ones...

234
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:44,248
Huh?
I can pay you back that money.

235
00:16:44,324 --> 00:16:46,258
I know where those guys are!

236
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,925
That'll cancel out my debt to you!

237
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:51,723
That had better be the truth.
Otherwise, I'll break your neck.

238
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:53,698
It's true! It's true! It's absolutely true!

239
00:16:57,738 --> 00:17:03,074
Oh, but Tenma's there right now...
Oh well...

240
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:08,347
You said what I did was

241
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,213
an indiscriminate terrorist attack,
didn't you?

242
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:15,745
That's ridiculous! There was
a good reason for what I did...

243
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:23,291
Now that I've killed
the president of GWE,

244
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:27,163
I could die tomorrow and I wouldn't mind.
I feel so good.

245
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:28,768
Counselor...

246
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:34,139
I was a lawyer in East Germany...
This guy was secretary to a politician.

247
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:37,611
When the Wall came down,
we all lost our jobs.

248
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:42,106
Doctor... Can you understand
how we feel?

249
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:49,679
After the Wall fell, the GWE
used the power of money

250
00:17:49,756 --> 00:17:51,417
to infiltrate into East Germany...

251
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:57,992
They aggressively built factories
on our land...one after another...

252
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:06,966
That is our country... I took pride
in shooting him. I took pride...

253
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:10,466
Oh! Counselor...!

254
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:13,906
It's cold...so cold...

255
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:17,073
H-Hang on!
Our friends will be here soon!

256
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:18,914
They won't come.

257
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:24,649
Our friends won't come.
I have a feeling...

258
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:29,796
Stop the bleeding!

259
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,722
Stop it now! Or I'll shoot you dead!

260
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:37,162
I'll...kill you!

261
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:38,634
I don't want to die...

262
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:39,839
Huh?

263
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,705
I don't want to die...
I don't want to die...

264
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,382
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid to die?!?

265
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:59,816
That's how they all died.
The twelve people you killed.

266
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,184
That's how they...!

267
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:05,665
That's what it means, to kill someone!

268
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:09,967
Get me some disinfectant
and a pair of scissors.

269
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:11,170
What?

270
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:12,330
You have that much, don't you?!

271
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:21,209
Arterial bleeding... He's gone into
hypotensive shock.

272
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:23,316
I will use finger pressure on
the damaged artery

273
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:24,350
to stop the bleeding.

274
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:29,219
I will suture the open flesh.
Needle and thread...

275
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:30,790
W-We haven't got anything like that.

276
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:32,286
Then a stapler will do!

277
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,822
A stapler...?!

278
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:35,194
Hurry up and get it!

279
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:36,229
Yes, sir!

280
00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:52,311
Okay!

281
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:55,915
Huh?

282
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,440
What are you going to do?

283
00:19:57,718 --> 00:20:00,415
I applied first aid.
I'm taking him to a hospital.

284
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:06,855
A-A hospital?!

285
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:10,295
What are you thinking?!
If you don't put him down, I'll kill you!

286
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:12,523
Shoot me if you want!

287
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,901
If you're going to shoot me,
then you take this guy to the hospital.

288
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:40,092
Put me down here...
You get out of here...

289
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:45,996
I remembered a while ago... I thought
I'd seen your face somewhere before.

290
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:49,893
You're that doctor who's wanted
in those serial killings, aren't you?

291
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:52,098
Hurry up and put me down!

292
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:59,737
What I did was not
an indiscriminate terrorist attack.

293
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:06,046
The guys I killed were the president
of GWE, his lackeys,

294
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,211
and his bodyguards.

295
00:21:08,088 --> 00:21:10,648
So you're saying that there were
no unintended victims?

296
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:15,522
You mean the girl
who was at the news stand?

297
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,294
So, you did know about it...
That you had shot her.

298
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:26,569
Why did you save a man like me?

299
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:30,838
Not because you were afraid you
were going to be killed, right?

300
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:34,741
Your eyes tell me you weren't afraid
of being killed.

301
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:40,186
Why did you save
this indiscriminate terrorist...this killer?

302
00:21:41,688 --> 00:21:45,056
Because I believed you...
That you were a human being.

303
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:50,858
Hurry up and go!
The police will be here...

304
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:53,232
You have to live...

305
00:21:58,438 --> 00:21:59,405
You...

306
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:02,901
You're a brilliant doctor...

307
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:10,107
So what happened to the money?!

308
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:12,310
Hey, Doctor!

309
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,854
Don't tell me you fixed him and just left!
-The perpetrators of the terrorist attack

310
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:17,618
this morning at Erfurt Station
have been captured.

311
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:20,693
Say something, will you?!
-Police anticipated strong resistance.

312
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:24,864
But it seems they surrendered
without a fight.

313
00:22:29,336 --> 00:22:32,636
We're not running
a charity here, you... Hey...!
