1
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:11,124
You haven't touched alcohol
since then, have you?

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,658
I haven't had a single drop.

3
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:15,369
Good!

4
00:00:15,837 --> 00:00:19,569
You can start over again
as long as you don't drink.

5
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:24,605
I can't drink when I see you
once a week.

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,075
I'm afraid of lightning.

7
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:28,613
What do you mean by lightning?!

8
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:31,850
I'm a respectable counselor!

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,552
Well, I don't have
the time to drink.

10
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:38,420
I've got my first big case
since becoming a private detective.

11
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:39,894
Big case?

12
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:43,263
Doctor, what do you think of this guy?

13
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:44,698
What do you mean?

14
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:48,733
Dr. Reichwein, using physiognomy,

15
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:50,464
what kind of man do you think he is?

16
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,839
Physiognomy?

17
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:54,208
Richard!

18
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:57,575
Aren't you mistaking me
for a fortune-teller or something?

19
00:00:58,179 --> 00:00:59,908
But that's what you're known for.

20
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:04,242
They say that you can tell a person's
personality just by looking at him!

21
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,656
That's the result of many years
of interviewing clients.

22
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,884
Then using the results
of those interviews,

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,190
see if this guy is a con man or not.

24
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:16,022
A con man?!

25
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,233
He's no good!

26
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:21,294
He doesn't have
the face of a con man.

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,037
He's the type that would
immediately expose himself if he was.

28
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:26,473
Uh-huh...

29
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:29,306
Then what's the possibility that
he'd commit suicide.

30
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:34,114
None at all. People with faces like this
would never kill themselves.

31
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:37,384
Your physiognomy
is strangely convincing

32
00:01:37,485 --> 00:01:39,954
when said so straightforwardly.

33
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:42,047
It's the result of interviews!

34
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:44,988
So did something happen
to this man?

35
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,428
Hans Georg Schuwald...

36
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:48,820
Schuwald?

37
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:51,495
Doctor, you know who he is,
don't you?

38
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:56,795
Yeah. You mean the wealthy...
Vampire of Bavaria?

39
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:00,366
Yes. That tycoon is my client.

40
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:02,265
The man in the photograph...

41
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:07,406
Edward Fahren, was pretending
to be his son.

42
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,278
He gave himself away, didn't he?

43
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:13,954
No, Schuwald
completely believed him.

44
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:17,383
He cleverly deceived him.

45
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:21,096
Even I had trouble figuring out
that he was a fake.

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,056
But a mystery still remains.

47
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:28,828
How did he know enough
about Schuwald's son

48
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:31,338
to make Schuwald believe him?

49
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:35,402
You should ask him that yourself.

50
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:40,237
Well, he's actually
already killed himself.

51
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,473
Come on, Martin...

52
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:15,871
We're old friends, aren't we?

53
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:19,474
At least let me see
Edmund Fahren's suicide note.

54
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:21,780
The handwriting has been analyzed.

55
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:24,283
It is definitely his writing.

56
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:27,747
We don't need to show
outsiders like you.

57
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,324
Karl Neumann and Lotte Frank,
the ones who discovered the body...

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,095
They worked at the same
part-time job as Fahren, didn't they?

59
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,689
They're just friends.

60
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:39,930
Just friends, huh?

61
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:41,900
So how are you doing?

62
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:43,403
Same as usual?

63
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:46,696
Yes. I'm always shorthanded.

64
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:51,777
I haven't had a break
since I took over your position.

65
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:56,176
"Slowpoke Martin" has
become a big shot.

66
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,284
Don't call me that.

67
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:02,748
You're no longer my superior!

68
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:04,255
Come on, Martin.

69
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:08,284
You clearly don't know
how much trouble we had back then.

70
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,560
We took all that time

71
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:13,532
and almost arrested
that multiple homicide offender.

72
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:16,298
But you were drunk
and shot him to death.

73
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:19,037
All that trouble
to clean up afterwards.

74
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,670
I want you to leave.

75
00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:28,605
We don't have the time to deal
with a simple suicide.

76
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:31,845
Oh.

77
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,988
I'd like to check out the scene.

78
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:36,648
You've preserved it, right?

79
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,159
Not really. It's not a crime, so
permission has already been given.

80
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:42,663
They should be clearing out

81
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,824
the possessions of
the deceased today.

82
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,357
Jeez!

83
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:51,806
When did "Slowpoke Martin"
become so efficient?!

84
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,046
I made it.

85
00:05:59,513 --> 00:06:02,539
A broker will be coming to
take everything away soon.

86
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:04,949
Oh. It'll just be 2 or 3 minutes.

87
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,926
He hung the rope from this pipe.

88
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:19,598
He wrote his suicide note
at this desk.

89
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:23,494
A paper he was writing...

90
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:30,240
<i>The Birth of Tragedy, Process and
Reality, World Views on Psychology...</i>

91
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:34,371
I see. A typical
philosophy student's bookshelf.

92
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:38,545
These were the materials
he used to write this paper.

93
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:42,849
This is Caesar's <i>Gallic Wars.</i>

94
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,518
Why is only this book
unrelated to the others?

95
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:48,518
Spanish?

96
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:51,497
No, is this Latin?
I can't read this at all.

97
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:58,568
It's a clean book,
but it's only underlined here?

98
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:01,567
Room 204... Here it is!

99
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,142
Hey, bring more cardboard boxes!

100
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:06,072
Okay.

101
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,506
Put the books in the boxes first.

102
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,573
Understood.

103
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:11,777
Good work.

104
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:13,948
What should we do with this desk?

105
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:15,756
Put that over here.

106
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,650
Okay.

107
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:25,291
Yes?

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,667
I'd like to ask you about
the room next door.

109
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:31,332
I already said everything I know.

110
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:34,634
No, I'm not with the police.
I'm a private detective.

111
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,969
Whoever you are,
you're being a nuisance!

112
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,040
I have to turn in a paper tomorrow.

113
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:42,944
I haven't been able to concentrate
because of all the trouble next door!

114
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:45,678
All right, all right.
Then just one question!

115
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:49,750
Were these two close to Fahren?

116
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,659
Who knows?
I've never seen them here.

117
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:57,759
The guy next door...didn't seem like
he had many friends.

118
00:07:58,032 --> 00:07:58,658
Is that so...?

119
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,290
That's enough, right?

120
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:01,768
Hold on, hold on.

121
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:02,997
Just one more thing!

122
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:05,068
What is it?!

123
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:09,106
Could you translate
this underlined part?

124
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:10,370
Huh?!

125
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:13,544
You've got to be kidding!

126
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:16,874
It'll be your fault if I fail my class!

127
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,777
Sorry.

128
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,749
Umm... "I no longer..."

129
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:22,456
"...can continue"...

130
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,422
" ...to deceive."

131
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:30,063
What was that?

132
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:31,627
I don't know!

133
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:33,127
That's enough, right?!

134
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:34,394
"I no longer..."

135
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:36,126
"...can continue"...

136
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:37,600
"...to deceive."

137
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:40,602
I've heard that somewhere.

138
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:00,088
Do you like this place as well?

139
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:11,398
Hey, if I remember correctly,
you're...Johan.

140
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:16,670
Come up here. You can see
the view better from here.

141
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:17,970
Okay.

142
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:28,651
Oh, thank you.

143
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:36,019
Whoa. It's kind of scary.

144
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:38,123
It's not scary.

145
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:44,327
H-Hey, stop!

146
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:48,141
Stop that.

147
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,078
Stop that! It's dangerous!

148
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:55,811
Do you come here often?

149
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:57,849
Y-Yeah.

150
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:02,554
The lights of the houses go on
at about this time.

151
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,282
Families are coming home.

152
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:10,263
It starts to smell like
dinnertime everywhere.

153
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,363
I long for that.

154
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:14,768
You long for it?

155
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:19,233
Yeah. I've never had dinner with
my family ever since I was a child.

156
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:22,469
What's your family like?

157
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:26,205
Oh.

158
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:29,709
Sorry. Did I ask
something offensive?

159
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:34,777
I was actually taken in
by foster parents when I was a child.

160
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:37,621
Could you tell me about it?

161
00:10:38,225 --> 00:10:38,851
Huh?

162
00:10:39,627 --> 00:10:40,753
Tell me about yourself.

163
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:49,133
It wasn't anything!
This is it!

164
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,299
"I can no longer
continue to deceive."

165
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,906
It's Fahren's suicide note.

166
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:56,169
No.

167
00:10:57,278 --> 00:10:58,803
That wasn't a suicide note.

168
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:02,711
It was just a translation
of that line from this book.

169
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:11,255
That's my life story.

170
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:14,920
It's a bit depressing, but...

171
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:20,794
It's strange. I can talk to you
about anything.

172
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:23,594
Your story just now...

173
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:26,065
Your rich father...

174
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:28,475
Are you talking about Schuwald?

175
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:52,562
Are you crying for me?

176
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,241
Hey. We've got to do something.

177
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:08,015
I take care of Schuwald
and I can't help but worry.

178
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:12,986
He hasn't been eating much
since Fahren's suicide.

179
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:18,387
At this rate, he's going to die next.

180
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:23,095
Karl... Why don't you tell him that
you're his real son?

181
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:28,330
I just wanted to see
what kind of person he was.

182
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,635
If I told him the truth...

183
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:38,807
He'd think that I was someone
who was after his money.

184
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:43,679
Schuwald is that kind of person.
Everything is about money.

185
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:46,977
He won't understand my feelings.

186
00:12:48,222 --> 00:12:49,951
But you've got to do something!

187
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,093
Your true father is suffering
in the depths of despair.

188
00:12:57,531 --> 00:13:00,091
I see. So that's it.

189
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:01,394
Huh?

190
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:04,437
In that case, I have a plan.

191
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:15,075
"I can no longer continue to deceive."

192
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:18,678
The note that Fahren left
wasn't a suicide note.

193
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,852
This Latin book was in his room.

194
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,125
He was just translating
this underlined part in Gallic Wars.

195
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:29,928
It doesn't look like this is a suicide!

196
00:13:31,131 --> 00:13:32,098
I don't have conclusive proof.

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,992
It's just my intuition
from many years as a detective.

198
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,635
Are you listening, Mr. Schuwald?!

199
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:45,769
You don't seem very energetic.

200
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,342
It's...fine already.

201
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:50,743
Huh?

202
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,684
It's...fine already.

203
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:59,120
What are you saying?
It's not fine!

204
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,498
If he didn't commit suicide,
your life may be in danger!

205
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:07,233
He...

206
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:11,231
He was my son.

207
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,864
H-Hold on a second!

208
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,702
I already informed you!

209
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:17,775
Neither his birthplace
nor his background

210
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,472
has anything to do with you!

211
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:21,414
He was a fake!

212
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:24,949
Fahren was indeed a good person.

213
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:27,387
He wasn't the kind of person
who would con people.

214
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:31,184
But he tried to trick you.

215
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:38,124
The master is tired.
Please leave now.

216
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,325
I refuse to end the investigation here!

217
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:47,498
And I'm not saying that because
this is my first high-profile job!

218
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:49,870
I can feel it.

219
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:54,280
There's an even bigger evil
in the background.

220
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,984
In life...

221
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,678
In life...

222
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:05,083
There are things we can never redo.

223
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:11,894
Do you understand?

224
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:17,369
I understand...very well.

225
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:19,866
I'm continuing the investigation.

226
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:22,034
Understand?

227
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:30,482
A treaty of children's rights?

228
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:31,476
That's right.

229
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,448
You could call it

230
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,720
an international standard to protect
the civil liberties of children.

231
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:42,123
It's what I'm working on right now.

232
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:47,456
But volunteering to take care of
the children at this facility

233
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:48,660
is unrelated to that.

234
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:50,236
I do it because I want to.

235
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:54,539
So...could you tell us more about
what you said earlier?

236
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:57,802
Schuwald went bankrupt
three times in the past.

237
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:03,274
Yeah. Each of those three times,
he'd disappear temporarily.

238
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:06,778
And when he'd reappear,

239
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:08,753
he worked tirelessly
to regain his fortune.

240
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:16,955
He told me about that
when I did my Friday reading job.

241
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:20,766
Did you ask him where he went
when he disappeared?

242
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:22,028
Yeah.

243
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:25,028
We should take him there, right?!

244
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:28,132
Everyone has a place
that makes him feel better.

245
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:33,270
Like how you look at the houses
from the roof of the university.

246
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:34,473
Huh?

247
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:45,454
Mr. Kuntz, it looks like
the bathroom sink is clogged.

248
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:47,485
Could you take a look?

249
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:50,627
It's that sink.

250
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:02,168
Lotte, what's wrong with it?

251
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:08,346
Hey! Open up.

252
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:09,482
Stop messing around!

253
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:11,846
What are you thinking?

254
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:24,189
Hey! Open up! Hey!

255
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:25,765
What are you going to do
with the master?!

256
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,234
The master can't see!

257
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:32,066
Open up!
Kidnappers, kidnappers!

258
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,542
Okay!
Our plan was a success!

259
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,804
All right, let's go!

260
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:43,012
Where are you taking me?

261
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,317
A nice place!

262
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:57,692
I know that
you're not Margot Langer.

263
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,497
I just want information on Fahren,
the boy who died.

264
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,197
He came here, didn't he?

265
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:06,905
Fahren...which one was he?

266
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:08,308
Which one?

267
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:14,276
Two groups came claiming to be
Schuwald's son.

268
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:16,347
Is it the blond one?

269
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:18,777
Or is it the black-haired one?

270
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:19,986
Black-haired?

271
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:23,591
The black-haired one came with a girl.

272
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:27,189
I can't believe he'd bring a girl
to a place like this.

273
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:29,956
Black hair...and a girl?

274
00:18:31,264 --> 00:18:33,631
Could they be these two?

275
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:37,663
Yeah...that's right.

276
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:39,500
This boy...

277
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:43,139
...said that he was Schuwald's son?

278
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:49,540
Is it really here?

279
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:52,581
There's no mistake.
It should be around here.

280
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,952
Where have you taken me?

281
00:18:57,924 --> 00:18:59,153
Well...

282
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,452
It's the Owenberg Woods.

283
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:10,226
We thought it would cheer you up.

284
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:14,202
Let me out.

285
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,150
Can you see the lake?

286
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:25,284
Y-Yes.

287
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:28,951
Are the autumn leaves
of the woods beautiful?

288
00:19:30,223 --> 00:19:31,816
Yes, very.

289
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,176
What about the wrens?

290
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:53,642
I can't hear the chirping of the wrens.

291
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:59,585
I'm very sorry.

292
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:03,556
This place has become...
an industrial area.

293
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:05,752
Can't you hear it?

294
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:07,052
Huh?

295
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:10,889
Listen very closely.

296
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:14,290
They're chirping so beautifully.

297
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:23,699
Many apples have fallen in the grove.

298
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:30,743
Hold out your hand.

299
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:45,457
Come this way.

300
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:48,893
What a sight.

301
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:53,571
The autumn leaves look like
they're on fire in the afternoon sun.

302
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:58,767
It's being reflected like a mirror
on the calm surface of the water.

303
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:01,948
You see it, don't you?

304
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:06,582
I can't believe that
such a sight exists.

305
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,300
I see it.

306
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:24,064
I can see it.

307
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,582
Wait a second!

308
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:46,555
What did you just say?!

309
00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:54,229
You said that two groups came here.
The black-haired boy brought a girl.

310
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:57,168
Then Fahren didn't come by himself?

311
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:01,234
Yeah. The blond came with someone.

312
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:09,204
The Fahren kid you speak of
couldn't speak properly.

313
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:14,477
The boy he called his friend
told me the details.

314
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:16,547
To tell you the truth...

315
00:22:20,193 --> 00:22:25,996
I would have believed him if he said
that he was Schuwald's son.

316
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,226
Who is he?
