1
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,727
I got divorced three years ago...

2
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:14,525
No. More accurately,
my wife ran away from me.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:23,334
Because instead of listening to her...
I mostly listened to this.

4
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:26,076
My wife told me that I was

5
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:30,983
"just a collector of people's
innermost thoughts..."

6
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:33,179
Doctor...

7
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:35,550
You're weird.

8
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,249
I may be.

9
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:43,421
I peer into the deep abyss harbored in
the depths of peoples' hearts.

10
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:48,799
There is a chance I may sink
into that deep abyss.

11
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:52,272
Your fourth victim was

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,468
an 18-year-old woman
from Munich, right?

13
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:57,102
Did you experience
any sexual pleasure

14
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:58,839
when you butchered her?

15
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:03,109
Doctor...

16
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,448
That aside, ask me
about my 12th killing.

17
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,359
Mrs. Hanna Kemp
from Krupp-Haus...

18
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:13,218
She was 52, wasn't she?

19
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:16,390
At that time...I...

20
00:01:16,464 --> 00:01:17,090
No...

21
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:18,822
You don't have to talk about that...

22
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,558
I'll probably ask you about it
sooner or later,

23
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:24,731
but right now, I want to hear about
the 11 killings before that.

24
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:26,633
Understand?

25
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:29,467
Now, I ask you,
when you commit a murder,

26
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:31,706
when do you reach
the peak of your sexual pleasure?

27
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:34,942
Before or after?

28
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:06,703
As discussed, the victims were
all long-haired girls

29
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:09,539
between the ages of
16 and 18 years...

30
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:13,972
These cases definitely fall
in the realm of sexual homicide.

31
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:17,682
But he has also confessed
to his 12th murder.

32
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,951
The victim in this case...

33
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,991
Mrs. Kemp, is not only older
than his other victims, at 52,

34
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:24,490
but does not appear to have
sexual scarring.

35
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:29,523
Since he claims to have carried out
the killing for a friend,

36
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:31,622
it appears that he is trying to
disrupt the investigation.

37
00:03:36,104 --> 00:03:36,730
Who is it?

38
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,005
Who's there?

39
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,484
It's me, Rudy.

40
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:57,450
Tenma?!

41
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:02,026
Well, I was surprised...

42
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:06,128
Sorry. This was the only way
I could visit you.

43
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:08,227
You know my reason, don't you?

44
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,100
Yeah, I've heard.

45
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:13,737
Do you think that I'm a serial killer?

46
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:16,143
I don't know...

47
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:21,839
I only have newspapers, television,
and rumors from college friends...

48
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,648
But why did you come to me
of all people?

49
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:30,618
We weren't that close...

50
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:34,093
Besides, you despised me.

51
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:41,194
I always thought that you despised
me whenever our eyes met...

52
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,632
Ah ha... I see...

53
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:48,203
You want me to return the favor.

54
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,836
Is it money?

55
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:51,172
No, it's not.

56
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:54,410
I heard that you were an authority
on criminal psychology...

57
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,177
I have something I want you to
take a look at.

58
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:04,990
"Look at me! Look at me!"

59
00:05:05,092 --> 00:05:09,825
"See how big the monster inside
of me has grown, Dr. Tenma!"

60
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:11,758
"Help me!"

61
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:14,491
"The monster inside of me
is about to explode!"

62
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,428
What is this?

63
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:26,672
I see. This Johan is the one
who really killed the director

64
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:29,239
and went on to kill the foster parents
who took care of him.

65
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,952
He disappeared once more
leaving messages like this.

66
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:36,553
I've got to find him
as soon as possible!

67
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:41,128
And you have to prove your
innocence as soon as possible...

68
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:53,070
Nearly 20 years ago, there was a man
who had been at the top of his class

69
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,541
at a famous medical university...

70
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,305
But then, a Japanese student
transferred to his school,

71
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,371
and that man's position changed.

72
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,784
The student was sociable

73
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,785
and quickly earned
everyone's respect.

74
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,049
Furthermore,
he got excellent grades.

75
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:10,384
The man who was always
at the top of the class

76
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,325
easily slipped down
after the first semester test.

77
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:17,121
During the second semester test...
the man became desperate

78
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:19,166
to take back his place
at the top of the class...

79
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:22,435
He did perfectly in all of his subjects.

80
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:23,897
But...

81
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:27,542
The final test was on
forensic medicine,

82
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:29,406
a subject that the man
struggled with.

83
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,376
All his work would be for nothing
if he failed this test...

84
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:39,781
He used his last resort...

85
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,779
<i>Now I can be at the top of the class!</i>

86
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:44,658
But...

87
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,631
But the Japanese man
never told anyone...

88
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:59,400
As a result, the man
returned to the top!

89
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:08,044
So is there anything you can tell me
about these two messages?

90
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:11,083
Does he have what you would call
a split personality?

91
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:16,181
Are you trying to say
that one personality

92
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,988
is committing the crimes
and the other is trying to stop them?

93
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:24,191
Indeed, there are examples
of serial murderers

94
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:26,666
leaving messages like these
at crime scenes...

95
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:32,438
But, sometimes, they can be a means
to escape their crimes.

96
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:38,368
Telling the difference is
the job of a psychoanalyst!

97
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,094
Most people think that serial
murderers are introverted,

98
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:45,483
but that's a big misconception.

99
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,489
There are some who are intelligent,
sociable, and good conversationalists.

100
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:53,653
They are skilled liars.

101
00:07:56,664 --> 00:08:00,191
Is he just playing with me?

102
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:02,529
Now, hold on.

103
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,128
It's not good to jump to conclusions.

104
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:07,801
Could you tell me
a little more about Johan?

105
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:11,010
I became divorced three years ago...

106
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:14,676
No, more accurately,
my wife ran away from me...

107
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:17,884
<i>Thank you, Rudy...</i>

108
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:22,850
<i>That was very interesting, Tenma.
I'd like to research this thoroughly!</i>

109
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,090
<i>Give me a call in two weeks.</i>

110
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,393
What do you think of this man?

111
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:31,431
I can relate.

112
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:35,100
Oh? What can you relate to?

113
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:39,073
The monster...he talks about...

114
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:41,241
I see...

115
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:43,170
There's a monster, huh?

116
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:45,642
Indeed, there is one.

117
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:50,373
There is a monster within you,
within him, and even within me...

118
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:51,885
Stop.

119
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:52,879
Huh?!

120
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:54,748
That's armchair theory.

121
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,782
What?

122
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:01,553
I'm saying that monsters
exist in this world.

123
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,231
What's with that look?

124
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:09,561
Don't look at me like that.

125
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:17,108
I hate being looked down on!

126
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:21,879
Wh-What are you...

127
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,247
W-Warden...

128
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,326
Are you scared?

129
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:34,995
Are you scared?!

130
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:36,222
Are you?!

131
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,533
There are scarier things in the world.

132
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:45,501
I'll tell you something interesting.

133
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:49,072
Thank you for your cooperation.

134
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,811
You're sure he's going to come to you,
aren't you?

135
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:54,739
He'll come.

136
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,781
I'll call you as soon as he does.

137
00:09:58,819 --> 00:09:59,479
But...

138
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:01,247
But?

139
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:06,917
I want him as a research subject
after you arrest him.

140
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:12,466
Dr. Tenma is
a very interesting criminal...

141
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:23,869
<i>I'll tell you something interesting.</i>

142
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:28,541
Go to Mrs. Kemp's house.

143
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,444
Go to the underground storeroom.
You'll understand if you go there.

144
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:44,863
<i>There's proof that monsters do exist...</i>

145
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:51,564
Yes?

146
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:55,165
Ah, Tenma...

147
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:58,038
Yes, I'd like to meet you...

148
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:03,049
Hmm... All right...
Then, I'll be waiting.

149
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:08,549
Sergeant Kohl?
I promised to meet Tenma.

150
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,260
8 PM at the Oder Park,
in front of the fountain...

151
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:13,619
Bye...

152
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:25,829
Right now, I am verifying
Jurgens route on the day of his crime.

153
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,569
According to his confession,

154
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:31,236
he broke into this storeroom
and spent several hours here.

155
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:35,740
When Mrs. Kemp returned home,
he forced his way into

156
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:38,046
the second-floor bedroom
and committed his crime.

157
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:45,151
Nothing out of the ordinary...

158
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:46,752
But...

159
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:49,657
There are many picture frames...

160
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:53,129
Mrs. Kemp is shown...

161
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:05,810
A doll, huh?

162
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,144
I don't see anything abnormal...

163
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:12,276
There is no proof of the monster
that Jurgens spoke of!

164
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:17,718
As I thought, the 12th murder was
done to disrupt the investigation.

165
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:22,256
He confessed that he committed
the crime as a favor for a friend...

166
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,729
By calling that friend a monster...

167
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:51,947
<i>When I was a child, I was
disciplined by my mother daily.</i>

168
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:58,061
<i>There was a big doll
that my mom cherished...</i>

169
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,064
<i>It was a long haired...girl doll...</i>

170
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:06,662
<i>I asked that doll for help
as I was being hit.</i>

171
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:11,144
<i>But it only looked at me and grinned...</i>

172
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:16,279
<i>And that storehouse was filled
with pictures of my mom.</i>

173
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:21,346
<i>Wherever I looked, there was
Mom... Mom... Mom...</i>

174
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:25,150
<i>She was watching me all this time!</i>

175
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:28,051
What's the meaning of this?!

176
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,061
It's exactly as he described...

177
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:36,798
Did Jurgens change this storehouse
to be like the one from his childhood?

178
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:51,784
This is Jurgens when he was a child!

179
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:52,979
Impossible!

180
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:55,881
He shouldn't have any connection
with Mrs. Kemp when he was a child!

181
00:13:58,158 --> 00:13:59,648
What's with this photograph?

182
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,031
Jurgens' childhood face is pasted on?

183
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:19,939
This one too...

184
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,076
And this one... And this one...

185
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:24,543
And this one...

186
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,348
Mrs. Kemp never had any children...

187
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:31,650
This boy...

188
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:34,758
Who are you?!

189
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,465
<i>There's proof that monsters do exist...</i>

190
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:45,969
<i>I...just did as I was told
in a letter from my friend.</i>

191
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,033
<i>F-Friend?</i>

192
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:55,011
<i>One day...I received a white envelope
without a return or mailing address.</i>

193
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:59,343
<i>At first, I was annoyed
by his familiarity.</i>

194
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,445
<i>He said that he understood me...</i>

195
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:05,788
<i>The letters came every day.</i>

196
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:08,819
<i>He loved to write letters.</i>

197
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:16,169
<i>But before I knew it,
I could hardly wait for his letters...</i>

198
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:18,900
<i>I enjoyed them...</i>

199
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:24,110
<i>I thought...that he might
really be a friend.</i>

200
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:28,242
<i>Then one day, I was called out
by those letters</i>

201
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:31,680
<i>to go to the storehouse
of a certain home...</i>

202
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,544
<i>Was it Mrs. Kemp's storehouse?</i>

203
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:40,753
<i>I wonder how he knows...</i>

204
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,394
<i>I wonder how he knows
about my childhood...</i>

205
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:51,430
<i>I was confused
at Mrs. Kemp's house.</i>

206
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:53,734
<i>"What's the meaning of this?"</i>

207
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:57,943
<i>"Mrs. Kemp is...my mom?"</i>

208
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:01,214
<i>Before I realized it,</i>

209
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:03,773
<i>I had gone to the second floor
and killed Mrs. Kemp.</i>

210
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,180
<i>He loves to write letters!</i>

211
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:10,753
<i>That friend also sent letters
to Mrs. Kemp.</i>

212
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:25,538
What's this?!

213
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:29,635
Here too!

214
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:31,804
And here...

215
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:34,273
And here...

216
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:38,141
<i>"Look at me! Look at me!"</i>

217
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,682
<i>"See how big the monster inside
of me has grown, Dr. Tenma!"</i>

218
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:43,356
<i>"Help me!"</i>

219
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,357
<i>"The monster inside of me
is about to explode!"</i>

220
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:49,488
<i>It's the message that Johan left!</i>

221
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:52,491
It's the same...

222
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:01,172
The friend... Johan...

223
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:03,633
...actually exists?

224
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,546
Not yet?

225
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:15,748
It's already far past eight.

226
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,282
Sergeant Kohl...

227
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:18,751
What's that?

228
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:23,622
He's come...

229
00:17:24,998 --> 00:17:26,625
The longhaired Asian...

230
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,537
Sorry to bother you
when you're busy, Rudy.

231
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:43,680
I analyzed what you said.
I thought that you made it up.

232
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:46,252
I didn't think that Johan existed.

233
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,687
I thought he was an imaginary person
you made up...

234
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,850
Wha–?!

235
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:53,249
Rudy, listen to me! I...

236
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,527
Currently, I'm researching
a serial murderer named Jurgens...

237
00:17:59,132 --> 00:18:03,160
There's only one case that's different
from his usual crimes.

238
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:05,963
Forget that, listen to me!

239
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:07,436
Listen up!

240
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:09,475
We're finished for today!

241
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:10,972
Come again!

242
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:12,670
The carnival is over.

243
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:17,449
Tell everyone to apprehend him
when I give the signal!

244
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:18,544
Yes!

245
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:20,583
Don't fail to catch
Dr. Tenma's conversation...

246
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:24,749
Tenma...
You despised me, didn't you?

247
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:31,693
You despised me ever since
you saw me cheating in college...

248
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,366
Isn't that right?

249
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:38,194
S-Sergeant Kohl, this is bad!

250
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:41,806
Dr. Gillen and Tenma are headed
toward the west exit!

251
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:45,877
They'll get lost among
the leaving carnival crowd!

252
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:50,183
Indeed, I probably
should be despised...

253
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:52,350
Rudy, forget about that, right now...

254
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:53,443
Do you remember?

255
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,654
Back then, I hid a cheat sheet
right here...

256
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,550
Like this.

257
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:04,227
<i>Run away you're surrounded
by the police.</i>

258
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:06,431
Don't look! Let's walk.

259
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,034
Is the doctor being threatened?

260
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,428
W-Well...

261
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:13,705
There's too much noise around,
so I can't hear them...

262
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,809
- Wait...
- Wait...

263
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:22,614
Jurgens said that he killed
Mrs. Kemp for a friend.

264
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:26,546
Th-This is...

265
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:29,856
It's something from
the basement of Mrs. Kemp's house.

266
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:34,523
Mrs. Kemp never had any children...

267
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:41,299
Your Johan and Jurgens' friend
are probably the same person!

268
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:47,735
<i>They've passed through the west exit.
Shall I apprehend him?</i>

269
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,939
Wait! Tenma may be carrying a gun!

270
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:54,176
There was a letter
with the same message as Johan's

271
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:55,976
in Mrs. Kemp's house.

272
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,883
Johan lived off Mrs. Kemp
and disposed of her

273
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:01,352
when he no longer had a use for her.

274
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:05,154
As you said, he might have done it
to erase his past...

275
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:09,692
You're innocent.

276
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:16,935
I can't talk specifically at this point,
but I'll tell you what I've figured out...

277
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:21,872
I don't know how,
but Johan can smell out murderers.

278
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,605
He can pry into their loneliness
and control them.

279
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:30,974
There haven't been any murders
of any foster parents

280
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:34,146
that Johan was taking advantage of
during his young adulthood.

281
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:36,986
I think it's probably because,
age-wise,

282
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,525
he no longer needed foster parents.

283
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,159
But there's another possibility...

284
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,666
Johan finally found
his ideal family and joined them.

285
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:51,695
But why would he try to
erase his past?

286
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:54,233
Does he have some sort of reason?

287
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:59,472
For what purpose could he have
joined this family?

288
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,709
For what?

289
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,680
Now then...

290
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,489
We've arrived at the bus terminal!

291
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,386
Confirm what bus he's getting on!

292
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:14,491
Get cars to the terminal!

293
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:15,853
Prepare to track him!

294
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:16,688
Yes!

295
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,795
I bought you a bus ticket...

296
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,270
Tenma...there's a way to

297
00:21:25,338 --> 00:21:27,432
turn yourself in now
and prove your innocence!

298
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,099
I'll help you!

299
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,070
I'm...not chasing Johan
to prove my innocence!

300
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:36,642
Huh?

301
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,545
Thank you, Rudy.

302
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:41,647
Tenma...

303
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:43,752
Could it be that
you're going to kill Johan?

304
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:49,695
Oh yeah!
I never despised you...really...

305
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,455
I thought you were an interesting guy,

306
00:21:52,532 --> 00:21:53,761
but I never had the chance
to talk to you.

307
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:56,830
But now we've finally become friends!

308
00:21:57,604 --> 00:22:01,370
But...when I cheated back then...

309
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:04,369
You looked in my direction.

310
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,206
I also cheated back then.

311
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,386
What?!

312
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,890
The five buses left at
about the same time?!

313
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,997
Tenma...
