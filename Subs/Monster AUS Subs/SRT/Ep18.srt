1
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:14,096
Hey, we don't need to
take a detour here.

2
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:15,767
Let's get going!

3
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:19,097
Jeez. I give up...

4
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:21,737
I'm starving and broke.

5
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:26,103
If only that rug were still safe...
Damn it.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,887
What is this?

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,815
T-This is...

8
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:49,431
"Help me! The monster inside of me
is about to explode!"

9
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:55,937
There are two personalities...
within Johan?

10
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:36,043
That means that when you arrived
at the warehouse,

11
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,944
that Asian and the arsonist
were already fighting...

12
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:44,681
The Asian noticed you and fled...

13
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,745
Is that right, Miss Anna Liebert?

14
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,582
Yes.

15
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,594
Well, the culprit is
an extreme right-winger.

16
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:57,090
He turned himself in, saying that
it was a fire to celebrate his people,

17
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,564
or something like that...

18
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:04,501
Your identification checks out,
so that's enough for today.

19
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:08,308
May I leave, then?

20
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:09,569
Yes.

21
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:15,547
Oh, also...

22
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:21,947
The townspeople referred to
the Asian as Dr. Tenma.

23
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:26,317
Do you know anything about him?

24
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,322
I don't know anything.

25
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,496
What do you think?

26
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:39,874
Judging by her clothes,

27
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,933
do you suppose she was
trying to prostitute herself?

28
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:44,878
Not that.

29
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:45,672
Huh?

30
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,714
About Dr. Tenma.

31
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,649
At first, that's what
the Turks called the Asian.

32
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:59,858
But as soon as we told them that he
was suspected of multiple homicides,

33
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:04,524
they all said that
they didn't know who he was.

34
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:16,072
I became your reference.

35
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:18,445
Mr. Rosso.

36
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,317
I'm glad to see you're safe, Anna.

37
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:24,647
I was worried about you.

38
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,545
You just suddenly disappeared!

39
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:40,501
So you changed.

40
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:46,800
Yes! Those kinds of clothes
definitely match you better...

41
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:48,966
That earlier look didn't suit you.

42
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,907
Come on, you must be hungry.

43
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,644
Have something to eat!

44
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,076
Mr. Rosso, aren't you going to
have dinner?

45
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,580
I've already finished eating.

46
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:01,749
Just coffee is fine.

47
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:04,920
Now, eat up.

48
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:07,059
Yes, thank you for the food.

49
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:18,572
What is it?

50
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:22,470
You always pour five spoonfuls
of sugar into your coffee, don't you?

51
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:27,742
Of course.

52
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:30,842
Coffee isn't good if it isn't sweet.

53
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,750
You finally smiled.

54
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:37,684
Huh?

55
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:43,964
You finally smiled.

56
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:52,105
You looked pretty glum for someone
interviewing to work for me!

57
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:57,941
Is it that strange that I put a lot of
sugar in my coffee? Umm...Anna...

58
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:00,614
A-Anna Liebert.

59
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:02,742
Umm...

60
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:05,183
You're hired!

61
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:08,746
Of course!

62
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:11,487
Having a beautiful girl like you
working at my shop

63
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,550
would be excellent for business.

64
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:15,629
But...

65
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,689
But?

66
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:20,560
You should smile a little more!

67
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:23,461
It's a waste of your beauty.

68
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:26,171
Th-Thank you very much.

69
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:27,903
I'll work very hard!

70
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,805
There's no need to be so nervous!

71
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:34,409
This is an Italian restaurant
in a country town.

72
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:36,740
We aren't too busy.

73
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,221
Go around to the other side.

74
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:48,321
Okay.

75
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:52,464
I'll put out the food from here.

76
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:55,029
You carry the food out
to the customers.

77
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:58,199
Plates you've taken away are to be
placed on the right side of the counter.

78
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:01,937
The wine is here, and the glasses
are on this shelf.

79
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:05,178
There's also wine above this counter.

80
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:07,774
Order slips are placed here.

81
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,144
The wine is above the counter.

82
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:11,949
The glasses are over here...

83
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:13,076
This is for water.

84
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:14,447
Okay.

85
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:15,950
Morning...

86
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:17,517
Welcome.

87
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:19,082
Welcome.

88
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:21,324
I'm starving...

89
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:30,504
What?

90
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:34,235
Pleased to meet you, I'm Anna.

91
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:35,933
Pleased to meet you?

92
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,572
Whoa, you're not really the waitress
for this place, are you?

93
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:41,874
Huh?

94
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:45,678
What do you mean by that?

95
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,679
There's no doubt, Anna is
waiting tables here, starting today.

96
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,656
Pleased to meet you.

97
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,628
Really?

98
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:56,359
Hmm?

99
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:33,261
Anna, get me a carbonara!

100
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,467
Anna, I'll have a bolognese!

101
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:38,571
Anna, could you get me some water?

102
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,069
Yes, right away!

103
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:45,207
Orders for a carbonara
and a bolognese.

104
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:46,639
All right.

105
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:49,241
Thank you for waiting.

106
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,417
Thank you.

107
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,553
Vongole and rigatoni.

108
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:55,849
The fettuccine’s also ready.

109
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:57,591
All right–!

110
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:02,791
Rosso, how did you trick this cutie
into working here?

111
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,131
I didn't trick anyone!

112
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:13,403
Anna, I'll take you to a store
much better than this place.

113
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:14,975
Are you free tonight?

114
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:16,035
Hey!

115
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:20,004
You'll pay if you harm my poster girl!

116
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:24,646
Whoa, "Crybaby" Rosso is
saying something courageous.

117
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:26,696
Anna, just the other day,

118
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,281
he was at my house crying
while he was watching a movie.

119
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,159
S-Shut up!

120
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,896
Another order of squid ink risotto!

121
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:47,806
Ah... "Summertime" is playing...

122
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:49,202
Huh?

123
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:52,135
"Summertime" is playing
in the classical movie theater.

124
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,106
See?

125
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:03,586
Isn't it great that Frankfurt has
a lot of movie theaters?

126
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:06,291
It was on TV recently.

127
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:08,994
Man... It just makes me
cry so much.

128
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:11,294
Have you ever seen it?

129
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:12,692
No.

130
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:14,727
I see.

131
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:19,130
The movie takes place in
the Italian town of Venice.

132
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:23,099
Venice was a port city
in medieval Italy.

133
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:26,037
It was called "the City of Water."

134
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,048
Oh?

135
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:31,883
It was a town that was built
on a tideland known as a lagoon.

136
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:34,753
There are canals running
throughout the town.

137
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:38,920
I'd like to show you Venice sometime.

138
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:41,755
Mr. Rosso, have you ever gone there?

139
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:46,923
Yes... And the soundtrack
is also good.

140
00:10:47,635 --> 00:10:52,903
I think you've probably
heard its theme song before.

141
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:54,641
What's it like?

142
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,744
Umm...

143
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:05,352
Oh yeah.

144
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:07,652
Why don't we watch it right now?

145
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:10,253
We still might be able to get in.

146
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:12,624
Oh...yes.

147
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:13,920
But...

148
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:18,690
I see. It'll get late if we go now.

149
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:19,759
Yes.

150
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,947
I'm back!

151
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:36,409
Ah... Welcome back.

152
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:39,078
Oh... I'll do that.

153
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,054
It's all right.

154
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:45,125
Sorry for taking off from work
every afternoon.

155
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,924
It's fine. It's always slow
around this time.

156
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:53,430
I don't mean to be nosy, but...

157
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:56,937
Where do you go every day?

158
00:12:01,342 --> 00:12:06,303
Oh...that's fine. You can do
what you like in your free time.

159
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:10,778
Gun training.

160
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:12,977
Shooting?

161
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:17,082
Yes. At Mr. Venkel's shooting range.

162
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:20,384
Ah, you're going to
Venkel's place, huh?

163
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:21,986
He's a good guy!

164
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:39,012
Mr. Rosso, have you ever shot a gun?

165
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,949
Not at all.

166
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,783
Just looking at guns
makes me tremble.

167
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:57,723
Here you go. Enjoy.

168
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:58,751
Thank you.

169
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:42,167
How is it this time?

170
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:46,963
Taste it.

171
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:57,417
What does it taste like?

172
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:02,049
Garlic, olive oil, parsley, and...

173
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:03,779
The flavors of the other things
you put in have disappeared,

174
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:04,824
haven't they?

175
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:05,885
Yeah.

176
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,861
Then that's not real pasta.

177
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:12,595
This is difficult.

178
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,932
Everything requires training.

179
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,343
Mr. Rosso, you can take a bath now!

180
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:28,982
Good night...

181
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:46,630
To think that there were movies
like this when I was young.

182
00:15:58,111 --> 00:16:01,604
Mr. Rosso, you always cried
when you watched movies.

183
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:06,095
Yeah...when I was young,
I never had the time to watch movies,

184
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,053
even if I wanted to.

185
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,326
I ate a lot of delicious things then,

186
00:16:13,393 --> 00:16:16,226
but I don't remember
how any of them tasted.

187
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:19,464
I didn't even know the taste of sugar.

188
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:21,629
The taste of sugar?

189
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:26,899
You know about me, don't you?

190
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:35,107
I checked up on you after you left.

191
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:43,247
Nina Fortner.

192
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:47,655
Disappeared after her parents
were murdered...

193
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:53,795
What did you want me to do?

194
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:56,302
A request?

195
00:16:57,104 --> 00:16:58,868
Did you want me to teach you?

196
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:05,001
I thought of...having you teach me.

197
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,847
How did you find out about me?

198
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,056
A professor at my university's
law department was researching you.

199
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:20,824
The Ristorante Nino Case.

200
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:23,121
The Sacco-Milano Case.

201
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,456
The Sabatini Murder Case.

202
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:31,937
You were called as a witness
for all three of those cases.

203
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:35,134
And all three fell apart due to
lack of evidence.

204
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,071
But that professor had
an interesting theory.

205
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:42,541
According to his theory...

206
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:47,082
You're a professional hitman.

207
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:50,256
An incredible first-class one...

208
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:13,139
How many people
do you think I killed?

209
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:17,780
To be honest, I don't know.

210
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:25,091
I was still a kid... Before I knew it;
I was a member of an organization.

211
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:29,326
I stole, extorted money, everything.

212
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:32,298
In the end, I became a hitman.

213
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:36,295
I was able to eat well, as a reward.

214
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,011
I didn't care.

215
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:50,150
It was my job.

216
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:06,627
It was the same on that day as well.
The same as usual.

217
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:29,646
It was noon at a cafe.

218
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:35,188
I didn't know how many I'd already
killed by then or who my victim was.

219
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:37,287
I had him in my sight.

220
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:42,858
He had ordered a coffee.

221
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:47,406
And began putting sugar in it.

222
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:50,376
One spoonful...

223
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:52,745
Two spoonfuls...

224
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:55,248
Three spoonfuls...

225
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,517
Four spoonfuls...

226
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,185
When he poured the fifth spoonful
of sugar,

227
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,988
I could taste the coffee I always drink.

228
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:14,259
The man savored that coffee.

229
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:27,139
That's when I dropped my gun.

230
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,490
That was it... That's why I couldn't
kill people anymore.

231
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:46,495
Why didn't you ask me how to kill
during the past six months?

232
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,496
I...

233
00:20:52,506 --> 00:20:55,203
I didn't want to get you involved.

234
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:19,762
Must you go?

235
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:25,264
Now then...

236
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:35,740
Thank you, Mr. Rosso.

237
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,876
It's easy to kill people.

238
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:43,655
You just have to forget
the taste of sugar.
