1
00:00:08,963 --> 00:00:12,900
Get out of here quickly!
The police are coming.

2
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:14,229
B-But...

3
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:17,965
Dresden... Wait at the public square
in front of the station.

4
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:24,879
Give me the message. Quickly.

5
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:27,874
Here...

6
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:32,681
edok Bridge... Three frogs?

7
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:35,053
And my father also said,

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,957
"If the monster you're
chasing is a twin..."

9
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:45,364
<i>The mother of the twins
is still alive in Prague.</i>

10
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:18,282
There!

11
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:21,921
There!

12
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:25,129
Give it back!

13
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:27,368
Hey, here you go!

14
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:29,027
Nice!
There it goes.

15
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:31,629
Stop.
Give it back!

16
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:32,901
Pass it to me!

17
00:02:37,578 --> 00:02:39,273
How is it going Mr. Grimmer?

18
00:02:39,547 --> 00:02:42,073
Did you find the data
you were looking for?

19
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,796
The school's structure
has completely changed

20
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,584
since the reunification of
East and West Germany.

21
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:50,153
We don't have any earlier data.

22
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:54,226
Well, thank you for your time,
Principal Garbrecht.

23
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:57,557
It's unusual to have retained
this much data.

24
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:01,058
When the Berlin Wall fell,

25
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:05,402
most of East Germany's
unsavory data disappeared.

26
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:07,767
But...

27
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:14,376
I am certain that children were abused
in East Germany's orphanages.

28
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:20,282
I just can't find any
information to prove it.

29
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:22,456
I can imagine.

30
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:25,418
East German orphanages
were usually managed by

31
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:27,791
the Ministry of Public Health
and Welfare.

32
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:31,294
But there were problems when
the children's parents were

33
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:35,233
Criminals, anti-government protesters,
spies, defectors to the west,

34
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:37,135
or those who were caught
trying to cross the border.

35
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:41,403
The orphanages where
these children were kept

36
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:45,071
were managed by the infamous
Internal Affairs Ministry.

37
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,279
No one knows how much abuse and
inhumane personality corrections

38
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:52,478
those children endured there.

39
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:56,988
I've been trying to gather
as much information as I can

40
00:03:57,058 --> 00:04:01,689
so that I can find out exactly
what happened there.

41
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:07,926
Exactly what, huh? I see.
That's a tedious investigation.

42
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:12,372
Most of those involved have
either passed away or kept silent.

43
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:17,906
That's right. Even Mr. Schnurr,
the instructor here...

44
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,769
Mr. Schnurr?

45
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:24,979
He was a teacher at
East Germany's 62 Kinderheim.

46
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,755
I asked him for an interview,
but he refused.

47
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,554
You should be careful.

48
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:37,430
There is the possibility that Mr. Schnurr
abused children while in East Germany.

49
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:45,300
Oh! Is it all right if
I make copies of this data?

50
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,235
Y-Yes, go right ahead.

51
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:53,780
Mr. Grimmer, you're really a journalist
from West Germany, aren't you?

52
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:56,149
No. I'm from this side.

53
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,284
I was a reporter for
a newspaper in Leipzig.

54
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,485
Oh... I never expected a civil libertarian
like you to be from the East.

55
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:04,558
Well...

56
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,030
During that time, I flew around the world
as a special overseas correspondent.

57
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,864
They were missions given
to me by the government.

58
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:19,473
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

59
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,570
I was a spy.

60
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:27,608
Heave!

61
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:30,342
That's a big bag you're carrying.

62
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:34,144
It's packed with data I've collected
from around East Germany.

63
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:37,123
I'm looking forward to
reading a good article.

64
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,426
So where are you going now?

65
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:44,526
To Prague, in the Czech Republic.
Thank you for your help, Director.

66
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:04,883
You were treated
pretty badly back there.

67
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,151
Did they end up
taking your shoes?

68
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,916
Don't cry.

69
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:28,369
People can live without shoes.

70
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:31,568
We were born barefoot.

71
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:33,673
But...

72
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:39,486
Those who pick on people
by taking their shoes...are terrible!

73
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:43,952
There's no need to cry over what
those terrible guys have done to you.

74
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,251
See you later.

75
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:08,840
Were they so big that
they were an inconvenience?

76
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:23,860
Umm... Excuse me.

77
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:24,691
Huh?

78
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,730
Do you have a second?

79
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:28,269
Okay. What's wrong?

80
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:36,467
Well... I have a problem.
My bag with my passport was stolen.

81
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:39,970
Your passport? That's bad.

82
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:45,685
It is. I was going to see
my younger sister in Vienna.

83
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:49,887
Yesterday, I received word
that she had collapsed.

84
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:53,724
Collapsed?
You should go quickly!

85
00:07:54,328 --> 00:07:56,387
You should go to the police.

86
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:58,556
Oh, I-I already did that.

87
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:02,594
Actually, right now...my sister doesn't
have any money for a doctor.

88
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,100
Oh... That's terrible.

89
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:08,965
My bag also had my wallet in it.

90
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:10,344
Oh...

91
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:16,276
I can't go, but my sister will
be all right if I send money.

92
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,848
But I can't even do that.

93
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,749
How much do you need?

94
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:25,286
Oh...you don't need to!
I don't need too much money!

95
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,220
I just need money to
pay for a doctor to see her.

96
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:32,856
I can only give this much.

97
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:38,672
Th-Thank you. Danke schön!
I'll pay you back.

98
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:41,972
Write your address here.

99
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:46,202
No, that's all right.
If it will help your sister get better.

100
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:49,277
Thank you! God bless you!

101
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,244
Take care of your sister!

102
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,279
How could you
give money to him?

103
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:57,050
Huh?

104
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:59,149
He was lying!

105
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:00,221
Lying?

106
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:04,560
He's always waiting in front of
the train station for a sucker.

107
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,592
Don't be fooled by those types.

108
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:10,896
I was fooled?

109
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:19,544
<i>The express train to Prague will be
departing from track seven at 3..15.</i>

110
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:23,609
Huh?

111
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:38,664
Oh. Thank you for helping me.

112
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,425
No problem.

113
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:56,373
Thank you for earlier.

114
00:09:57,618 --> 00:09:58,881
Is it all right if I sit here?

115
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,346
S-Sure.

116
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,397
Where are you going?

117
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,300
To Prague.

118
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,586
You're Japanese...aren't you?

119
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,680
Huh?

120
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:35,255
Konnichiwa.

121
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:36,449
Domo.

122
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:38,985
I've been to Japan before.

123
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:40,293
Okay...

124
00:10:40,794 --> 00:10:43,354
I wonder how many
years it's been...

125
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:46,123
It was 1982, so...

126
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:48,868
Oh yeah,
I went to Akihabara.

127
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:53,371
I ordered a lot of wire taps and
other high-tech gadgets.

128
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,140
Also, this song was popular.

129
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:58,706
Um...

130
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:04,576
<i>Kita no...
Hakaba doori na wa...</i>

131
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,580
Huh? That's not right.

132
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:09,782
<i>Kita no...</i>

133
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,255
Sakaba doori ni wa...

134
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,787
Yeah, that's it!

135
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:19,759
<i>Kita no...
Sakabadoori ni wa...</i>

136
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:22,169
And there were robots.

137
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,204
My son would have been happy if
I had brought back a plastic model kit.

138
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,874
Where's your son now?

139
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:31,008
Huh? Oh...
He died.

140
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,179
Entry inspection.
Present your passports.

141
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:45,253
Oh...okay.

142
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:52,121
Danke schön.

143
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,936
The Elbe River.

144
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:08,108
How's the trout fishing
this year?

145
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,781
Not very good.

146
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:15,778
I see. Last year,
I caught one this big.

147
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,787
That would be
impossible this year.

148
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:19,559
Danke schön.

149
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:34,035
He knows you have
a fake passport.

150
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:43,542
You should run away,
Dr. Tenma.

151
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:45,942
H-How do you know me?

152
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,678
Never mind that.

153
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:51,185
The border police realized
that your passport is a fake.

154
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:52,350
They're coming.

155
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:56,222
You should get out
of here quick, Dr. Tenma.

156
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:15,715
Hey, you!

157
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:17,308
We want to pass.

158
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:22,388
Oh... S-Sorry.
My bag is too big and got caught.

159
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,216
I can't move.

160
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:26,148
What are you doing?!

161
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:28,923
Whoa! Don't be rough!

162
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:30,664
What's in here?!

163
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:32,923
Important things.

164
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:40,029
Ow! Ah, I got loose!

165
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:47,671
Do you know where
the other man went?

166
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:48,741
Huh?

167
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:51,581
There was an Asian man
with you in this room.

168
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:55,350
Who knows?
He probably went to the dining car.

169
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:57,049
Hey, check the next car!

170
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:57,750
Yes, sir!

171
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,816
This is passenger car two.
Emergency!

172
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,595
An Asian passenger was
using a fake passport!

173
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:04,457
Oh!

174
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,258
What's wrong?
- Hey!

175
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:10,659
Stop this train immediately!

176
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:38,458
Very good. Very good!

177
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,962
They aren't chasing us this way.

178
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:46,133
The train stopped,
so I got off.

179
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:50,968
Oh... I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Grimmer.

180
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,046
If you like, I can show you
the way to the border, Dr. Tenma.

181
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,330
I'm familiar with this area.
I come here often to fish.

182
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,562
Climbing this mountain
is a bit rough.

183
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:18,133
But I can see familiar sights.

184
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,668
Why did you help me?

185
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:23,969
Huh?

186
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:30,039
Oh... I worked at a newspaper
company in East Germany.

187
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:33,045
Right now,
I'm just a freelance journalist.

188
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:39,191
I read some articles on you.
I was interested in you.

189
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:44,191
False accusations were a part of
everyday life in East Germany.

190
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:48,501
Political prisoners falsely charged...
Accused murderers who aren't guilty...

191
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:55,773
Because of that, I can tell
who's really guilty or innocent.

192
00:15:57,811 --> 00:16:01,543
You're innocent.
Isn't that right, Dr. Tenma?

193
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:06,348
Could you please stop
calling me doctor?

194
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:12,717
Huh? You're a brilliant neurosurgeon,
aren't you, Dr. Tenma?

195
00:16:13,193 --> 00:16:14,627
I'm no longer a doctor!

196
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:28,298
What do you think?
It's a nice view, isn't it?

197
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:32,940
We can tell if anyone's
coming after us from here.

198
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:38,582
Now then.
Let's take a bit of a break here.

199
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:42,849
Would you like a sandwich?

200
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:45,149
I also have wine!

201
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:47,185
And delicious cheese.

202
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:51,290
No thank you. Umm...
I don't have time.

203
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:53,830
The sun is still high.

204
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:57,098
It's better to cross the border
when it's dark.

205
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:05,571
Picnics are fun aren't they?

206
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,174
It nice to do this every so often,
right Dr. Tenma?

207
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,647
Delicious food and
an amazing view.

208
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:17,086
This is when I can feel
the pleasures of living.

209
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:24,128
I respect doctors like you.

210
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:30,963
Journalists like me can make people
happy to be alive by writing good articles.

211
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:36,467
But you can provide
people with life itself.

212
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:39,012
I...

213
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:43,840
I shot a man.

214
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:57,795
Last month in Munich,
I shot a man for the first time.

215
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,134
He probably died.

216
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:08,372
Until then, I couldn't aim because
my hands would tremble.

217
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:14,036
But once I shot him...
my hands stopped trembling.

218
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:25,182
And now I have to
shoot another man.

219
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:31,160
I'm...no longer a doctor.

220
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,714
Whenever I go
to the Elbe River,

221
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:55,984
I think about how I would have
wanted to fish with my son here.

222
00:18:57,924 --> 00:18:59,551
Your dead son...

223
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:03,093
You can catch trout this big.

224
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:07,727
He died without knowing
the pleasures of fishing.

225
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:15,908
He would have been saved if
a doctor like you had been by his side.

226
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:24,341
But really, you can
catch trout this big!

227
00:19:34,194 --> 00:19:36,720
Beyond that mountain
is the Czech border.

228
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:41,461
Past there, when you leave the forest
path, you might be able to get a car.

229
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,899
I'm going back to
the station from here.

230
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:49,142
Thank you.
You were a real help, Mr. Grimmer.

231
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:53,711
I wish you the best of luck,
Dr. Tenma.

232
00:19:56,783 --> 00:20:00,242
If we meet again,
let's have a picnic.

233
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:09,862
Dr. Tenma!

234
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,395
Everyone has their sins.
They don't go away.

235
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:20,373
But you must do,
what you must do.

236
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:52,200
Wonderful...

237
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:55,974
Well, this is beautiful.

238
00:20:56,543 --> 00:20:57,942
It's the first time
I've come here,

239
00:20:58,011 --> 00:21:01,572
but at night, Prague looks like
a village out of a fairytale.

240
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:15,326
Excuse me...
Is it all right if I sit here?

241
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:16,989
Yeah.

242
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,700
I'm completely
taken by this town.

243
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:26,501
You're Mr. Pedrov, right?

244
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,637
You bought Russian citizenship

245
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,938
and are currently living here
in the Czech Republic.

246
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:34,873
I have some things
I want to ask you.

247
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:38,143
Will you help me,
Mr. Pedrov?

248
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:42,287
No, your real name
is Reinhart Biermann.

249
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,056
There was a special orphanage
in East Berlin, wasn't there?

250
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:51,825
It was an experimental lab where
scientific personality corrections

251
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:53,332
were performed on children.

252
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:58,900
511 Kinderheim
You were the director there.

253
00:22:03,176 --> 00:22:08,012
You should know everything,
since you were the director.

254
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:13,680
What were you trying to
achieve in East Berlin?

255
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:19,886
At 511 Kinderheim...
