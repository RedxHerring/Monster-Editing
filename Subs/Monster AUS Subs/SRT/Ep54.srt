1
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:14,202
The wind blew.

2
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,304
The bottle fell over.

3
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:20,402
The sandwiches were
covered in dirt.

4
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:23,406
That's when...

5
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:29,214
he smiled sadly.

6
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:39,823
Do you want to
eat one too, lady?

7
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:44,222
Hey, Franz!

8
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:45,355
That's rude!

9
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:50,404
Thank you.

10
00:00:55,977 --> 00:00:56,944
Is it good?

11
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:08,856
Walk.

12
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:22,870
Get in.

13
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:35,043
Oh. Hello?

14
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:40,579
Mr. Verdemann wasn't answering,
so I called you.

15
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:45,089
<i>Oh. His wife just gave birth,
so he's probably at the hospital.</i>

16
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,797
<i>I've heard rumors about you,
Eva Heinemann.</i>

17
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:53,460
<i>If you like,
you can talk to me.</i>

18
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:55,467
I was thinking of talking.

19
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,031
<i>About what?</i>

20
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:00,333
Testifying to
Tenma's innocence.

21
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:02,938
<i>I see. That's good.</i>

22
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,775
<i>So...
What hotel are you at?</i>

23
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,751
<i>I see.</i>

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,491
I'll be right over.

25
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,516
They're going to dodge and
pass me by at this timing.

26
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:25,549
The car comes.

27
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:27,579
I fall down.

28
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:35,794
It comes. I fall. It comes. I fall.
This timing will do.

29
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,025
It comes. I fall.

30
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:42,093
- Hey... Hey!
- It comes. I fall. It comes. I fall.

31
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:44,797
What is it?
I'm busy now.

32
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:47,507
Are you really going
to marry me today?

33
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,376
How many times
do I have to say it? It's true.

34
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:58,176
Truly true?
Swear to God?

35
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:02,348
Yeah. Today, I'd swear it
to anything, Helene!

36
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,783
Then kiss me Gustav.

37
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:14,432
Let's keep going in the car.

38
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:15,128
Huh?

39
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:18,838
Whoa ! Hey, wait. You idiot!
Now's not the time.

40
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:23,807
You took my drugs again!

41
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:25,713
That was the last of it!

42
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:27,972
I didn't do it.

43
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:31,178
I thought it was strange
you were sniffling. You bitch!

44
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,150
You were getting high in the car while
I'm desperately practicing for the job.

45
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,723
It's a pretty easy job.

46
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:42,554
You just have to
lie in the road.

47
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,626
Easy?! How can you say that?!
If I make a little mistake, I'm dead!

48
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:50,098
You're going to die?

49
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,868
Take a look!
I'll be gone just like that!

50
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:03,794
I don't want you to die.

51
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:05,946
No. It's just hypothetical.

52
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,446
You're going to die.

53
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:17,955
I won't die. I still have
something I have to do.

54
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:19,691
What would that be?

55
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,760
Make a lot of babies with you.

56
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:26,031
We're going to make
a soccer team with just our kids.

57
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:29,068
Ah. .. Wonderful...Gustav.

58
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,207
I'll get money once
this job is finished.

59
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:34,804
Then we'll get married.

60
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,651
You'll grant me my wish,
won't you, Helene?

61
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:42,953
Oh, Gustav.

62
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,185
I'll make them.
I'll make many many children!

63
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:49,687
I said, "Now's not the time!"

64
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:52,264
No. I want to make children!

65
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,396
Control yourself for now.

66
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:58,098
It's almost time for
"Detective Forster" to re-air.

67
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,408
The car comes.
Jump out. I fall.

68
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:05,636
The car comes.

69
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:08,579
Jump out. Fall.

70
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,784
The car comes.

71
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:12,152
Jump out.

72
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,387
Fall.

73
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:15,890
The car comes.

74
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:25,629
<i>I was thinking of killing
your former fiancée...Eva Heinemann.</i>

75
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:29,403
<i>Stop... Stop!</i>

76
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:31,629
<i>Don't do it!</i>

77
00:07:47,388 --> 00:07:49,652
The weather's nice outside.

78
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,618
Such a fine day,
but I'm stuck riding in this truck.

79
00:07:54,362 --> 00:08:00,392
And I'm with this heinous murderer.
I'm really unlucky.

80
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:02,329
Keep to yourself, Milch!

81
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:04,735
But you're lucky.

82
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:10,267
Because in this drab transport truck
headed to a miserable prison.

83
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:15,816
You get to hear about the twelve
escape stories of Günter Milch,

84
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:17,681
the king of prison breaks!

85
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:20,882
Now where should I begin.

86
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:25,221
My jailbreak at
Kreiner Prison is great.

87
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,350
Keep to yourself!

88
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:30,293
Why? I'm bored.

89
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,726
What time is it now?

90
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:38,595
I said, "What time is it now?"

91
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:41,242
9:32.

92
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:49,243
If I were free, "Detective Förster"
would be rebroadcast soon.

93
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:51,883
Do you watch that drama?

94
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:57,983
It's good.

95
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,627
It's almost time.

96
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:07,464
I'm going to do this job easily.
Watch me from here.

97
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:09,429
A gun.

98
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:12,003
You're not going to shoot it,
are you?

99
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:14,899
I won't shoot.
I'm just going to use it as a threat.

100
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:19,108
If we had children, It'd be awful
if their father was a murderer.

101
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,578
Don't shoot!
I'll even give up the drugs.

102
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:32,025
I love you Helene.

103
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:35,755
I really made up my mind !
Let's get married!

104
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:37,431
Really?

105
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:39,757
From now on,
I'll go straight.

106
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,703
I won't take jobs where
I wave around guns.

107
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:43,793
Really?

108
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:46,863
Yeah. Jobs where I wave
this around aren't any good.

109
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,065
Gustav...

110
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:51,005
Ah... This feels great!

111
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:52,045
Damn.

112
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:55,238
Helene!

113
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:56,611
What?

114
00:09:57,318 --> 00:09:58,843
I love you from
the bottom of my–

115
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,867
W-What is it?!

116
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:18,197
What's wrong?!

117
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:23,573
I-I hit someone.

118
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:25,439
What?!

119
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:29,213
You hit him?

120
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:32,976
Milch, sit down!

121
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:35,846
You hit him?

122
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,882
Can't you understand that
I'm telling you to sit down?!

123
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:42,258
It's probably my "little bro".

124
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,256
Huh?

125
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:47,931
The plan has failed,
Dr. Tenma.

126
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,370
I taught Gustav the timing
and how to act thoroughly.

127
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:58,338
I guess there isn't anyone
who can stop a car

128
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:03,816
by collapsing in the road like
a sick person as good as I can.

129
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:09,652
He's terrible at this,
so dodge him.

130
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:15,491
What good would it do
to hit him?

131
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:19,191
I don't know what
you're saying,

132
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:22,395
but anyway, check and see if
this man is the man you know!

133
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:48,962
Gustav...

134
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:52,790
Oh. .. Gustav...

135
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,163
Helene...

136
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:05,005
This is bad.

137
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:06,841
D-Do you think
he's still breathing?

138
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:09,274
This is bad.

139
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:12,479
Th-That doctor
is right over there.

140
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:19,155
Hey. .. Come here a moment.

141
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:20,853
Get out.

142
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:23,890
Hey!

143
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:40,004
Gustav is dead!

144
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,377
H-How is he?

145
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:43,274
Is he alive?

146
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:46,044
How could I?

147
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:49,056
How could I have
screwed this up so badly?

148
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:57,792
Gustav...

149
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:00,024
I'm stumped.

150
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,159
Let's smooth it over
in the report.

151
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:04,469
We can't smooth over
something like this!

152
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:06,162
W-Well... But...

153
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:12,738
The key.

154
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:15,779
Give me the key
to these handcuffs!

155
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:39,730
The key.

156
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:41,800
Give me the key
to these handcuffs!

157
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:04,020
Are you waiting
for someone?

158
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:05,124
Yes.

159
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:06,693
Would you like
something to drink?

160
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:08,068
Scotch.

161
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,465
No.

162
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,176
Get me a coffee.

163
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:18,107
<i>Next in the news...</i>

164
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:22,812
<i>This morning, there was a fire at
a large shopping center in Dortmund.</i>

165
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:28,148
<i>According to the workers, they put out
the fire, but two stores were burned down.</i>

166
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:30,567
<i>There aren't any reports
of anyone injured in the fire.</i>

167
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:31,888
<i>I was thinking of talking.</i>

168
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,788
<i>About what?</i>

169
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:36,754
<i>Testifying to
Tenma's innocence.</i>

170
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:40,562
<i>I see. I'll be right over.</i>

171
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:42,901
<i>Please wait
in the hotel lobby.</i>

172
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,674
What will I do if
I make him innocent?

173
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:53,370
<i>This just in.</i>

174
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:58,382
<i>This morning, at 10:00, in Erkrath,
a suburb of Dusseldorf,</i>

175
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:02,649
<i>two suspects who were being sent
to Hilden Detention Center</i>

176
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:04,418
<i>escaped from
the police transport.</i>

177
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:07,517
<i>Details have
not been released,</i>

178
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,460
<i>but the names of
the two escaped suspects are</i>

179
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,330
<i>Gunter Milch, who's suspected of
robbing a money transport vehicle,</i>

180
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,337
<i>and Kenzo Tenma,
serial murder suspect.</i>

181
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:23,468
<i>The police have made
an emergency deployment</i>

182
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:27,037
<i>to locate and apprehend
the two fugitives.</i>

183
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:32,986
Why?

184
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:35,955
Why did he escape?

185
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:40,391
Yes, hello?

186
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:43,090
Oh, Mr. Verdemann.

187
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:46,163
Yes, I heard the news.

188
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:49,628
Why do you have to escape?

189
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:56,303
I was just about to
prove your innocence.

190
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:57,403
Why?

191
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:01,446
I don't know what's going on.

192
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:04,976
I also don't
understand his actions.

193
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:08,548
Yes. Anyway,
let's go to the police.

194
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:15,486
But actually, there's something
I have to do before that.

195
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:21,030
I see. Yes. Yes.
That's right.

196
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:25,198
That's the situation,
so we should deal with this calmly.

197
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:30,100
Yes. Yes.
I think so, too.

198
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:31,808
<i>This voice...</i>

199
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:35,110
Anyway, we must
find out the details. Yes.

200
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:36,608
<i>This voice...</i>

201
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:40,196
Exactly. As you say. Yes.

202
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,187
<i>This voice...</i>

203
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:44,155
Yes. I'll try my best. Yes.

204
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:46,593
Roberto!

205
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:09,582
Your coffee...

206
00:17:57,531 --> 00:18:00,364
That's not my cigarette.

207
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:03,636
This smell...

208
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:14,506
It's that man's smell.

209
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:17,308
In this room...

210
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:23,149
Roberto was just in this room.

211
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:37,236
Gustav! Gustav is dead!

212
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:41,169
Helene, he's still not dead.
But it's no use.

213
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,100
He's not bleeding even though
he's hit his head.

214
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,869
It's a cerebral hemorrhage.
Isn't that right, Doctor?

215
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:51,685
I understand your feelings,
but we're going to switch cars

216
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:53,981
in the road in the woods
up ahead as planned.

217
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:57,652
Gustav is in the way.
We're going to leave him in this car.

218
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,758
No!

219
00:18:58,825 --> 00:18:59,792
Keep going!

220
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:00,620
Huh?

221
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:03,019
There's no time to switch cars.

222
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,422
Don't be silly!

223
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:06,689
The police are
looking for this car.

224
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,528
They'll quickly catch up to us!

225
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:13,006
There's a possibility he'll be saved if we
get him to a hospital as soon as possible!

226
00:19:13,507 --> 00:19:14,599
A hospital?!

227
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:20,809
Doctor, your quick wits turned
my failed escape plot into a success.

228
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:24,450
But as a pro,
I want you to listen to me.

229
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:28,244
It's terrible, but we've got to leave
Gustav in the road in the forest up ahead.

230
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:31,617
Go straight to the hospital!
The Eisler Memorial Hospital!

231
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,697
They have the best facilities
and staff in Dusseldorf.

232
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:40,529
It's the hospital where
I used to work! Quickly!

233
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:13,926
Up ahead is the hospital's
front entrance.

234
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:15,994
Don't cry!

235
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,429
When you get to the entrance, tell someone
to give this letter to Doctor Wagner.

236
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:23,171
The details of the accident
are written in it.

237
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:26,275
Gustav won't die?

238
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:27,776
He's still alive!

239
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:29,740
Don't give up while
he's still alive!

240
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:33,453
Go quickly!

241
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:41,288
Now then...

242
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:46,861
If we hang around here, it's like
telling them to come and get us.

243
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:48,668
You've been a great help.

244
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:49,428
Huh?

245
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:51,603
What are you going to do?
Where are you going?

246
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,498
You should stay with me.

247
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:55,908
You're an amateur.

248
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:59,437
There's a woman I know
whose life is in danger.

249
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,711
I've got to get to her quickly.

250
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:03,282
A woman?

251
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:07,076
Is that why you escaped?

252
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:13,518
You can screw as many great women as
you want if you escape with me to Tunisia.

253
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:16,156
Thank you. See you later.

254
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:21,734
Doctor.

255
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,797
You really never killed anyone,
did you?

256
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:32,243
I shot one person.
But he was still alive.

257
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,473
That's not killing.

258
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:38,582
You're going to get acquitted
in your case.

259
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:44,451
But you have
a real criminal record now.

260
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:47,557
You're a fine fugitive.

261
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,836
From one fugitive to another,
let's meet in Tunisia some day.

262
00:21:57,537 --> 00:21:59,005
It's a great place!
