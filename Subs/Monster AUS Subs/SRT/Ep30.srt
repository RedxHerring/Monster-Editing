1
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:10,423
He has been called to the heavens.

2
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:16,133
What lies here is nothing more than
the hollow shell of Richard Braun.

3
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:20,064
His soul, though, will live on forever.

4
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:24,972
Let us swear on his soul...

5
00:00:25,914 --> 00:00:29,077
To live our lives with hope.

6
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:34,164
Psalms 23...

7
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:35,451
I can't get over it.

8
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,260
What a sad funeral.

9
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:42,723
He was such a good detective.

10
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:46,365
But nobody from the force has come.

11
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:50,263
He had alcohol related problems
while on the force.

12
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:53,666
He got drunk and fell off a building.

13
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:55,934
Isn't that what the police are saying?

14
00:00:56,277 --> 00:01:02,114
Richard would have seen his
daughter on the day after the accident.

15
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,619
What. .. What did I do for him?

16
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,592
Dr. Reichwein...

17
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:18,365
I just sat in a chair and listened to
what he had to say.

18
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:20,928
"You've completely recovered"?!

19
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:25,739
What did I ever do for him?!

20
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:29,307
Dr. Tenma...

21
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:33,341
If we find him, there's a possibility
we'll be able to solve everything.

22
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:35,205
Dr. Tenma...

23
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:37,983
Don't you think it's odd, Doctor?

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,482
This isn't an accident!
This isn't a suicide!

25
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,727
Richard was talking to his daughter
a few hours before he died.

26
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:48,692
They were going to meet the next day.

27
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:52,325
Doctor...

28
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:58,067
You did all that you could do and
Richard was recovering wonderfully.

29
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:06,981
Stop blaming yourself.

30
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:47,975
And then...

31
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:50,350
Listen to me, Doctor!

32
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:53,083
My husband stopped talking to me

33
00:03:53,187 --> 00:03:56,179
after I found out
he was having an affair.

34
00:03:56,424 --> 00:04:00,361
He just washes the car
and cleans the yard everyday.

35
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:03,196
He even avoids me.

36
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:06,728
Well, it's better than not coming home.

37
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:10,027
I feel like I'm going to go crazy
if this keeps up.

38
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,834
Doctor, are you listening?

39
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:16,275
Y-Yes. Please continue.

40
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:20,403
So I went over to
the other woman's place.

41
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,347
What do you think happened, Doctor?

42
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:29,981
Possibility of murder?

43
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:32,785
There isn't any.
It was just an accident.

44
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:37,561
That evening, Richard Braun went
to the roof of building Number Twelve

45
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:39,327
at the University of Munich alone.

46
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:44,296
He drank a single bottle of whiskey,
got drunk, and fell off.

47
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:47,639
The bottle. ..did you
check it thoroughly?

48
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:51,537
Yes. ..we found Richard's fingerprints.

49
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:54,343
Could you show me the bottle?

50
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:58,485
Well, sure, but...it's in pieces.

51
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,425
Richard...

52
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:19,599
<i>Don't you think it's odd?</i>

53
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:24,811
<i>Richard was talking to his daughter
a few hours before he died.</i>

54
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,178
<i>They were going to meet the next day.</i>

55
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:54,568
Yes, this person came here that night.

56
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:55,966
Alone?

57
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,872
Well, I don't remember that far.

58
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,178
You say that you remember
when he came,

59
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:03,946
but can't remember
if he was with anyone?

60
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:06,778
Well. ..it's because he ordered coffee.

61
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:08,155
Coffee?

62
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:12,419
It's unusual for someone to come in
at that time and not order alcohol.

63
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:20,292
At that time, was he with this boy?

64
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:23,337
Who knows?

65
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:24,661
Try to remember!

66
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,434
I don't know.
Lots of customers came and went.

67
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:32,038
I just know that
he bought a bottle of whiskey.

68
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:33,805
It's written on the order slip.

69
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:36,240
Did Richard really buy it?

70
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:38,074
I don't remember!

71
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:41,953
I just know that it says one bottle
of Racke on the order slip.

72
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:45,092
What did you say just now?

73
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,594
One bottle of Racke!

74
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:04,540
Why didn't I notice this when I saw
the bottle label at the police station?

75
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:05,672
Huh?

76
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:09,344
<i>Are you drinking again?</i>

77
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:12,450
<i>Well...just a little.</i>

78
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,144
<i>What did you drink?</i>

79
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:17,588
<i>Whiskey! I only drink whiskey.</i>

80
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:21,621
<i>You made my entire room
smell of Racke.</i>

81
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:24,094
<i>Racke?! Are you kidding me?!</i>

82
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:26,662
<i>I never drink that domestic stuff!</i>

83
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,792
<i>If I'm going to drink,
I'll drink genuine scotch!</i>

84
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:30,362
<i>Nothing else!</i>

85
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:36,667
<i>Richard didn't buy the whiskey!</i>

86
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:51,784
<i>Johan...</i>

87
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:56,257
<i>It must have been him.</i>

88
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:04,562
W-Wait!

89
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:06,573
Hey, wait!

90
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:00,753
Hey!

91
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:02,926
W-What do you want?!

92
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:05,460
Why did you try to
shove me onto the tracks?!

93
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,831
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

94
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:09,164
Don't act dumb!

95
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:13,741
Hey, old man.

96
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:16,642
What do you want from my friend?

97
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:33,419
Wh-Who sent you?

98
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:44,872
Think about your age. Old men should
be looking after their grandkids.

99
00:09:48,142 --> 00:09:50,201
H-Hey, wait!

100
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:51,645
Huh?

101
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,177
Wait!

102
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:04,756
I was trained as
a border police officer!

103
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,051
Why did you try to
shove me onto the tracks?!

104
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:10,187
I-I don't know!

105
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:13,091
Don't underestimate a former officer!

106
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,698
S-Someone asked me to do it!

107
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:16,662
Who?!

108
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:18,305
A large man.

109
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,737
A large man?!

110
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:25,107
A guy I met in the subway
gave me money!

111
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:27,480
He told me to push you
onto the tracks!

112
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:19,833
I bought you something, Richard!

113
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,992
It's genuine scotch.

114
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,296
You wanted to have some, didn't you?

115
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:35,543
That's good enough... Have a drink.

116
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,086
Richard...leave it to me.

117
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:54,098
I'll figure out his. ..Johan's true identity.

118
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:18,253
Doctor, I told my husband
that his infidelity is a disease

119
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:21,955
and that he should be the one
in counseling with you.

120
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,928
Doctor, are you listening?

121
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:27,960
Oh.

122
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:30,871
Yes, of course, Mrs. Hesse.

123
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,604
What do you think?

124
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,007
If my husband keeps this up,
my depression will only get worse.

125
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:41,644
Well. ..you don't
really have depression.

126
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:42,642
Huh?

127
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,596
Besides, I'm more worried
about your husband,

128
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,079
silently washing his car
and cleaning the yard every day.

129
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:55,622
Aren't you? It's strange, no matter
how you look at it! Doctor, please.

130
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:57,997
Please see him.

131
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:03,427
Fine. Well, I'm open
the day after tomorrow at five o'clock.

132
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,696
I'll ask my husband.

133
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:13,273
Straighten out that oversized cheater.

134
00:13:28,195 --> 00:13:31,062
Doctor, that's the last of
your appointments for today.

135
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:34,394
All right, that's good enough
for today, Mereth.

136
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:36,336
Then, I'll be off ahead of you.

137
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:41,939
Oh yeah. Mereth, you forgot to
lock the back door again yesterday.

138
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:45,337
Oh, oh no. I almost forgot
to do it today as well.

139
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:47,241
Aww, I did it again.

140
00:13:47,414 --> 00:13:48,381
Good work.

141
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:05,223
Hey, Dr. Gillen... It's Reichwein.

142
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,804
I saw the newspaper.
Yeah, your newspaper ad.

143
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:15,367
"Let's talk about
our memories of cheating."

144
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:16,500
"From Rudi."

145
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:22,311
Do you really think that Dr. Tenma
will contact us with this message?

146
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:25,642
<i>Yes... Tenma definitely will
if he sees it.</i>

147
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,549
<i>It's something only the two of us
know about.</i>

148
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,857
I see.

149
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:35,284
<i>Doctor, don't do anything rash
until he comes.</i>

150
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:40,297
I know...but there's just one thing
I want to look up.

151
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:41,627
<i>What's that?</i>

152
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:45,328
The prostitute who pretended to be
Margot Langer.

153
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,870
Richard told me...

154
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:52,370
<i>Fahren, the boy who killed himself,</i>

155
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:54,437
<i>was with another boy
when he met her!</i>

156
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:57,445
<i>A handsome blond boy!</i>

157
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:01,245
Be careful, Doctor.

158
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:07,450
I know. I've got to be careful
if I want to uncover everything.

159
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:10,289
It's for Richard's sake!

160
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:13,632
Well, I'll call you later.

161
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:31,882
Mereth, you've forgotten
to close the window today.

162
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:38,082
Margot Langer?

163
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:39,492
I don't know her.

164
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:44,494
Well.. .her trade name right now
is Blue Sophie or something like that.

165
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:47,360
Ah... That fat old hag.

166
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:49,361
Gramps, is that what
you're interested in?

167
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:51,530
No, it's not like that.

168
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,063
Shy at your age?

169
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:55,172
Make a turn at the corner,
two blocks down.

170
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:56,732
The second floor of the old building.

171
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:58,344
Thank you.

172
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:00,844
But she's not there right now.

173
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:01,941
Huh?

174
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:06,350
I haven't seen her lately.
She's probably gone somewhere nice.

175
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,245
Somewhere nice?

176
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,723
Jeez. Why is that fat old hag
so popular?

177
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,053
A really rich guy
was seeing her until recently.

178
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:18,422
Where did she go?!

179
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:21,293
Say, what do you think of me?

180
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:24,594
I'm a lot more fun than that hag.

181
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:26,264
Do you know where she went?!

182
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:31,140
I don't know. She probably went off
with that new guy.

183
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:33,271
New guy?

184
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,683
Yeah. He became infatuated
with that hag despite his age.

185
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,352
He was a big guy.

186
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,049
Big guy?

187
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:44,657
He seemed like he was
big elsewhere as well.

188
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:49,924
Umm... Doctor...

189
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:53,723
Is it all right if I leave for today?

190
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:57,331
Ah, oh yeah. ..
You're only working until five today.

191
00:16:57,571 --> 00:17:01,633
That's fine. The only appointment
I have left is that cheating husband.

192
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:03,535
It's a date, isn't it, Mereth?

193
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,469
Oh, Doctor!

194
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,644
Just make sure to lock the doors!

195
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:16,252
I've got to show this picture
to the prostitute called Blue Sophie

196
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:19,054
who was pretending to be
Margot Langer.

197
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:25,490
If Johan was with Fahren,
and I can get her testimony,

198
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,126
I'm one step closer to
getting to the bottom of this.

199
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:32,972
Yes?!

200
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,370
My wife made the appointment.
I'm Hesse.

201
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:38,341
Ah, come right in.

202
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:45,574
I'll visit that woman once more tonight.

203
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:50,447
Pleased to meet you, Dr. Reichwein.

204
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:52,416
Welcome, Mr. Hesse...

205
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:54,124
Pleased to meet you.

206
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:55,622
Please, come in.

207
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:59,598
It's the first time
I've been in counseling.

208
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,932
There's nothing to be nervous about.

209
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:05,904
Just relax and talk about anything.

210
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:11,568
Our conversation will be confidential,
so don't worry.

211
00:18:12,346 --> 00:18:13,609
Even to my wife?

212
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:15,081
Of course.

213
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:21,081
How are you lately?
Do you have any concerns?

214
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:22,789
Concerns?

215
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:23,749
Yes.

216
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:29,663
My wife...found out about my affair.

217
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,097
I see.

218
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:33,967
I don't have a place at home.

219
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:37,033
I just clean the yard and wash my car.

220
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:39,201
That's how it is everyday.

221
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:42,701
Does that make you feel a little
better?

222
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,036
No.

223
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:47,510
I never talk to my wife.

224
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:50,579
You want to talk to her,
but don't have the chance?

225
00:18:51,485 --> 00:18:53,783
Well...I don't know about that.

226
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:55,850
What about the other woman?

227
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:57,249
Huh?

228
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,617
Have you broken up with the woman
you were cheating with?

229
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:01,687
Yeah.

230
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:03,722
I killed her.

231
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:04,890
Huh?

232
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:08,658
No. ..I saw a dream where I killed her.

233
00:19:09,703 --> 00:19:11,865
Do you see dreams like that often?

234
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:17,477
Often? No. ..I haven't seen any lately.

235
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:22,104
I was lonely.

236
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,048
Is that why you had an affair?

237
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:31,817
No.

238
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,686
It was after I met him.

239
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:35,454
Him?

240
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:39,829
A handsome blond boy...

241
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:47,096
No matter how many people I killed,
even when the country fell,

242
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:50,542
it all felt like a dream.

243
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:54,145
But. ..that all changed when I met him.

244
00:19:57,617 --> 00:19:59,745
Everything seemed real.

245
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,750
I was no longer alone.

246
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:14,734
W-Would you. ..like some tea?

247
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:17,501
No, I'm fine.

248
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:21,169
I'm a little thirsty.

249
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:23,372
Could you wait for a second?

250
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:32,979
My secretary already left.

251
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:34,854
It seems she's got a date.

252
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,654
Her tea is very good. It's unfortunate
that I can't pour you any of hers.

253
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:52,538
Doctor...

254
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:54,906
W-What is it?

255
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:59,512
A lot happens in
this line of work doesn't it?

256
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,845
You find out people's dreams.

257
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,556
Nothing good happens when you
find out a dream you shouldn't know.

258
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:18,557
Especially the fact that I'm a hit man.

259
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:32,442
A-Anyway, if you want to fix things
with your wife...

260
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,381
...talk it over once more.

261
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:43,447
<i>Hope you forgot to lock
the door today, Mereth!</i>

262
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:20,691
Y-You're...

263
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,197
Quickly, run away!

264
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:26,555
Doctor Tenma...

265
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:28,957
I've been keeping watch over you!

266
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:31,996
You're in danger. Run away!

267
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:34,132
Quickly!
