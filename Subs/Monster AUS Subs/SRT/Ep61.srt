1
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:12,457
You found a job as a waitress
and got a place to live.

2
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:16,230
But this bed is terrible.

3
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:19,608
It sinks in this far
when I get on it.

4
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:22,102
It wouldn't be able to support
your weight if you slept here.

5
00:00:22,744 --> 00:00:26,840
I'll sleep on this bed.
You should sleep on that sofa.

6
00:00:27,582 --> 00:00:29,175
There's no place
for you to sleep here.

7
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:29,976
Huh?

8
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:34,754
Go back to Dr. Reichwein
in Munich.

9
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:36,149
Why?

10
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:38,856
Why? Because you
have to go to school.

11
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:40,791
I don't have to go to school.

12
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:42,426
How will you learn anything?

13
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:44,232
You're teaching me.

14
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,230
It's not just about your studies.

15
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:48,468
You won't be able to make
any friends living like this.

16
00:00:49,037 --> 00:00:56,137
I have friends. You and Tenma.
Besides, you'll be lonely without me.

17
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:01,883
Anyway, you should
go back to Munich.

18
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:03,450
No!

19
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:05,447
I'm not going to Munich.

20
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:13,290
H-Hold on, Nina.
Are you going there today, too?

21
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:18,027
Hey, wait!
You should give it up already.

22
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:21,095
You've been going to
the same place everyday!

23
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:26,070
It's always the same ! You're
not going to remember anything.

24
00:01:26,574 --> 00:01:27,166
Nina!

25
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:59,998
We lived here.

26
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:04,501
Mom and I. ..and Johan.

27
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:22,948
That day, Johan was dragged
down these stairs and taken away.

28
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,791
No! Stop! Let go of me!

29
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:34,501
Mom ! Nina!

30
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:41,037
No. Nina is my name now.

31
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:44,844
What was I called then?

32
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:49,849
Nina? Anna?

33
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:54,444
What is my name?

34
00:03:57,925 --> 00:04:01,190
The car they put Johan
into went along this road.

35
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,800
<i>Don't keep secrets from him.</i>

36
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,907
They gathered children here
and held what they called "recitals."

37
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:21,682
Here in the Red Rose Mansion.

38
00:04:23,684 --> 00:04:25,049
The lock's broken.

39
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:37,123
They were trying to create
a "superior pupil" here.

40
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,360
What's a "superior pupil"?

41
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:48,568
Johan?

42
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:52,780
They also...

43
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,554
Who did it?

44
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:05,485
He escaped.

45
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:08,551
Johan ran away.

46
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,927
He went through
the rose bushes.

47
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:16,229
Ow!

48
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:21,901
Are you all right?

49
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:23,343
This pain...

50
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:24,103
Huh?

51
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:25,679
This pain...

52
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:27,773
Could it be?

53
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:39,620
I.. .was waiting in this room...
for Mom to come home...

54
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:43,722
for Johan to come home...
while I was reading this picture book.

55
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:50,036
<i>People can become
whatever they want to be.</i>

56
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:52,034
Franz Bonaparta...

57
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,804
Bonaparta held the recitals
at the Red Rose Mansion...

58
00:05:56,878 --> 00:06:02,976
I read one of his books as
I waited Johan to come home.

59
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:10,956
I smiled as I faced
the open door and said...

60
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:12,359
<i>Welcome home.</i>

61
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,927
Welcome home.

62
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:18,465
Welcome home.

63
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:22,603
Welcome home.

64
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:25,971
Welcome home.
Welcome home.

65
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,099
Welcome home.
Welcome home.

66
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:31,101
Welcome home. Welcome home.
Welcome home.

67
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:32,379
Welcome home.

68
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,147
<i>Now then, come here.</i>

69
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,448
The door won't open!

70
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:43,357
The door won't open
even when I say, "Welcome home !"

71
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,448
It won't open!
It won't open!

72
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,492
That's because I ...
That's because I ...

73
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,494
I remember! I was...

74
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:51,031
Stop it Nina!

75
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:55,798
You don't have to remember!
You don't have to remember anything!

76
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,233
I'm the same!
I have a lot of bad memories!

77
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,100
But you don't have to
remember any of that!

78
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:09,340
Fine, I'll go to Dr. Reichwein !
You too Nina, let's go back together!

79
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:13,950
Let's do as Tenma said!

80
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:21,421
We'll make fun memories
from now on.

81
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:35,069
Wait a second, Chief Detective!

82
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,941
All I can do is sit next to
a detective and just listen?

83
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:39,980
What's the meaning of this?!

84
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:44,361
We're trying to satisfy
your requests as best we can.

85
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:49,448
"As best you can"? In addition,
there's a thirty-minute limit per person!

86
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:52,088
Just listening to them
should be enough.

87
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:56,392
The fact that we are helping you
this much is quite extraordinary.

88
00:07:58,165 --> 00:08:00,463
We went through
a lot of trouble

89
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:03,094
and were finally allowed to
question these five witnesses.

90
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:04,705
Still...

91
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:07,270
You should have taken the opportunity
to get as many testimonies...

92
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,308
You're naïve.

93
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:09,002
Huh?

94
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:16,083
Those "children of the recitals" probably
don't want to talk about their pasts.

95
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:21,747
Well, the large amount of human
remains that we discovered definitely

96
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:26,259
has something to do with the former
Czechoslovakian secret police.

97
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:28,595
But you know...

98
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:34,466
The truth about things like this
usually remains a mystery.

99
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,804
Oh. He's the detective
in charge of the case.

100
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,733
This is Mr. Verdemann.
He's the lawyer from Germany.

101
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:44,411
Take care of the rest.

102
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:46,813
I'm Detective Suk.

103
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,148
Pleased to meet you.

104
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:51,147
I prepared the questions in advance.

105
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,884
Please do exactly as I tell you.

106
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:57,558
You will sit with me
only as an observer.

107
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:08,992
Number 3 Cerveny Street,
a.k.a. "The Red Rose Mansion."

108
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:13,340
It's burned down.
Currently, it looks like this.

109
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:17,436
But there is no mistake
that you participated

110
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:20,879
in the "recitals" here in 1968,
right, Mr. Erno?

111
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:24,851
How about it?

112
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,752
Have you heard of
Franz Bonaparta?

113
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:29,787
Can you please be quiet?

114
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,517
We're running out of time,
aren't we?

115
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,393
I just want to be thorough.

116
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:37,326
Do you want to be thorough
and end up with no information?

117
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:41,124
You don't know how hard
we worked to get this far.

118
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:42,397
I don't feel sad.

119
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:47,135
I thought this mansion was
my emotional foundation.

120
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,678
Upon seeing this image
of it burned down,

121
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:55,545
I thought that I would
feel sadder, but...

122
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:58,345
Do you feel nostalgic about it?

123
00:09:58,986 --> 00:09:59,953
Nostalgic?

124
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:04,415
Yes. This was like
a school to you, wasn't it?

125
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:08,556
Mr. Verdemann, please be quiet!
The questions that I prepared are...

126
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:09,858
I don't know.

127
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:15,796
Sadness... Nostalgia.. .
I don't know...

128
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:20,540
Emotional scars?
What do you mean?

129
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:23,809
Well, is there anything
that affects you now

130
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:27,974
because you participated
in those "recitals"?

131
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:30,450
Well... Not really.

132
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:33,050
What about your family?

133
00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:36,980
You don't have to answer.
You have that right.

134
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,550
I'm divorced.

135
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,954
Well, there weren't any big problems
between my wife and me, but...

136
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:49,736
My children... My oldest son and
my second son. ..committed suicide.

137
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,876
We didn't really
have any problems.

138
00:10:57,077 --> 00:10:58,442
But for some reason, they...

139
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:03,384
I wonder why they
committed suicide.

140
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:05,950
What are you trying to say?

141
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:10,788
I'm just saying all your questions
are "by the book."

142
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:14,151
How much have you been able to
get out of anyone so far?

143
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,691
You're a typical youth of today.

144
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:21,730
You probably try to ask girls out
"by the book" as well.

145
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:25,036
You're acting like a father.

146
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:31,536
I don't have a father, but I wouldn't
like to have a father like you.

147
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:34,972
Will the next person come in?

148
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:37,777
Memories of the "recitals", huh?

149
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:41,116
Anything you can recall,
no matter how trivial.

150
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:43,490
"The God of Peace
was very busy."

151
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:45,519
W-What are you?

152
00:11:45,593 --> 00:11:48,756
"He blew his trumpet every day. He didn't
have the time to look in the mirror."

153
00:11:49,897 --> 00:11:54,801
Klaus Poppe's <i>The God of Peace.</i>
You know it, don't you?

154
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:57,301
Yes. I kind of remember it.

155
00:11:57,871 --> 00:11:59,600
Aside from that,

156
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:04,201
I liked the one about the Monster of
the West and the Monster of the East.

157
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:07,380
What did you like about those stories?

158
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:09,843
Hmm... How should I put it?

159
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:13,252
It felt like I was being taken
to a different world.

160
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:14,720
A different world?

161
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:16,583
Well, I guess...

162
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:19,489
crying, being happy,
and being afraid...

163
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:22,557
I suppose it felt like all of
those things just disappeared.

164
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:24,697
Why did you feel that way
about this book?

165
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:28,697
I don't know.
I didn't feel a thing.

166
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,536
You didn't need
your own name anymore.

167
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:36,373
That's true freedom.
That's what it felt like.

168
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,503
Why did you feel like that?

169
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:41,345
Franz Bonaparta taught you
to feel like that, didn't he?

170
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:45,286
Was that the name of
the person who held the recitals?

171
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:49,613
That's what you clearly remember
from the recitals, right?

172
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:52,084
Clearly remember?

173
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:53,719
No.

174
00:12:55,462 --> 00:12:59,660
One day, a man came
to visit that mansion.

175
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:02,600
He said he was
from a radio station.

176
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:07,669
He said that he liked the song,
<i>Over the Rainbow.</i>

177
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:10,770
He told me about
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

178
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:12,302
What kind of man was he?

179
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,639
Tell me! Tell me about him!

180
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,384
What are you thinking?!

181
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:19,775
- Tell me!
- Cut it out!

182
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,355
Please, anything!

183
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:23,551
What are you trying to do?!

184
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:27,119
It's like your personal emotions
are influencing the questioning!

185
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:29,888
This is personal for you, too.

186
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:33,031
You're the young detective
that was falsely being accused

187
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,035
for the series of crimes
committed by the secret police.

188
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:38,832
You're him, aren't you,
Detective Suk?

189
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:44,276
You're desperate to prove
your innocence. Am I wrong?

190
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:46,905
The same goes for me.

191
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:51,952
My father was imprisoned
for being an East German spy.

192
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:54,711
I continued to believe that
he was falsely accused.

193
00:13:55,723 --> 00:13:57,987
But my father really was a spy.

194
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:04,125
I could no longer believe in anything
after I found out.

195
00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:06,929
I no longer believe in
anything in the world.

196
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:11,529
But now, I am pursuing a case involving
a man who has been falsely accused.

197
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,736
And because of that, I have once again
found something that I can believe in.

198
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,502
The man from the radio station
that the witness talked about...

199
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:22,276
was my father.

200
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,545
My father might have participated
in the brainwashing experiments

201
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,554
that happened at
the "Red Rose Mansion."

202
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:33,491
In order to find out the real truth,
you mustn't look away.

203
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:39,261
Say, can I go home already?

204
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:40,863
No, just a little longer.

205
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:47,931
About that man I told you about.. .
He told me, "Get out of here...fast."

206
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:51,644
"There is definitely a wonderful place
over the rainbow."

207
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:54,371
"It's where your family is"'
he said.

208
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:59,783
"Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz
gets to go home in the end."

209
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:02,913
"You must get away
from here fast"' he said.

210
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,689
So I cut all ties
with that mansion.

211
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:13,856
Is that enough?
My wife and kids are waiting.

212
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:15,158
Y-Yeah.

213
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:27,445
We mustn't look away.

214
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:29,074
Yeah.

215
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:31,778
There are two more witnesses
left to question.

216
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,718
Yeah. Let's continue.

217
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:49,996
Come on, Dieter.
Stop spacing out and hold it steady!

218
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:52,428
This is your study desk.

219
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:53,773
O-Okay.

220
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:57,537
Nina doesn't want to talk about
that happened in Prague.

221
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,737
According to what
I heard from you,

222
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:04,182
she's probably recovered
quite a bit of her memory.

223
00:16:05,085 --> 00:16:08,111
But it seems like
the brakes were hit

224
00:16:08,188 --> 00:16:11,783
right before her memories fully
came back to her, thanks to you.

225
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:14,621
Did I do something wrong?

226
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:15,855
No.

227
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:18,763
Dieter, you did a good job.

228
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:25,063
Now let's finish this quickly and
have some weisswurst and beer.

229
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:28,140
We ate all the weisswurst
last night.

230
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,274
Oh. That's right.
Oh no!

231
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:32,037
Doctor!

232
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:37,177
We bought your favorite,
weisswurst.

233
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:40,144
How considerate of you.

234
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:41,179
Oh.

235
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:43,882
<i>Dr. Reichwein, how are you?</i>

236
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:46,090
<i>- I'm sorry for not</i>
- Nina!

237
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,025
<i>- Contacting you for so long.</i>
- Lotte!

238
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:50,259
<i>I'm sorry for making you worry.</i>

239
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:52,093
<i>I'm safe.</i>

240
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:56,594
<i>Dr. Reichwein, to be honest,
I would like to ask you a favor.</i>

241
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:59,906
<i>I'm sure you know a woman by
the name of Eva Heinemann.</i>

242
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:03,267
<i>Right now, she's being pursued
by a certain organization.</i>

243
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:08,473
<i>I've sent her in your direction.
Please take care of Eva.</i>

244
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:12,845
<i>And please take care of
Nina and Dieter.</i>

245
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:15,555
<i>I'm almost finished.</i>

246
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:21,355
<i>I think this is the only way
to put an end to the case.</i>

247
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:23,887
"Sincerely, Kenzo Tenma."

248
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:31,170
This letter came
three days ago.

249
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:34,571
And there's still no sign of Eva.

250
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,974
Where was this mailed from?

251
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:39,642
You can't see the postmark
very clearly.

252
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:41,581
Can you look it up, Karl?

253
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:43,374
Yeah. Probably.

254
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:46,486
If we do that,
we'll know where Tenma is, right?

255
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:50,721
But.. .I'm a bit worried
about this last sentence.

256
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:56,162
"I think this is the only way
to put an end to the case."

257
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:05,628
Now then,
let's finish this study desk.

258
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:09,206
I drank a beer,
so my hand might slip.

259
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:14,338
Dr. Reichwein.

260
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,146
I think I can almost
remember everything.

261
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:21,745
When you do remember everything...
Are you prepared for that?

262
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:22,915
Yes.

263
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:27,360
Use whatever method necessary
to bring my memories back.

264
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:35,125
Honestly, I don't want to do anything.
But if you really want to...

265
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:41,970
You're fine with this,
right, Nina?

266
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:45,104
Yes, Dr. Gillen. But...

267
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:52,249
Whatever I say under hypnotherapy.. .
might be incredibly terrifying.

268
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:55,451
Will you face it with me?

269
00:18:56,123 --> 00:18:59,320
Yes. I'll be fine.
Let's face this together.

270
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:02,127
Now close your eyes.

271
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:06,165
Take a deep breath and
relax your whole body.

272
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,741
What was your mother like?

273
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:18,268
My mother...

274
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,373
My mother...she's nice...

275
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:30,150
songs. ..singing voice...
a beautiful singing voice...

276
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:33,485
The smell of pea soup.

277
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:35,695
What about your father?

278
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:40,991
My father... My father is...
a government soldier.

279
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:44,638
A government soldier?
Have you ever met him?

280
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:48,805
I've never met him.
My mother told me.

281
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,808
My father.. .was killed.

282
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:58,385
My mother. ..participated in
anti-government activities.

283
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:01,351
Your father was killed,
and your mother,

284
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:04,356
an activist who participated in
anti-government activities, escaped.

285
00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:06,526
Who was she
running away from?

286
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:15,394
The three frogs...we hid.. . but a
man in glasses caught my brother.

287
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:19,068
Your brother was caught, right?

288
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:20,804
The Red Rose Mansion!

289
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:25,305
Many people were dead.

290
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:27,841
Did your brother see that?

291
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:29,382
It hurts! It hurts!

292
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:32,383
It hurts! The rose thorns...
It hurts!

293
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:34,554
<i>Welcome home.</i>

294
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:42,554
Nina?

295
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,056
Nina?

296
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:48,293
I found out where Tenma
mailed his letter.

297
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:49,395
Where is it?

298
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:50,803
Frankfurt.

299
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:55,033
Nina? You've remembered everything,
haven't you, Nina?

300
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:57,509
I'm.. .not Nina.

301
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:59,179
Then who are you?

302
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:00,580
I don't want to say.

303
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:02,980
It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

304
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,050
Tell me.

305
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:06,543
Who are you?

306
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:08,855
I don't want to say.

307
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:11,814
It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

308
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:15,762
I don't want to say.

309
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:16,955
Huh?

310
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:19,132
I'm back.

311
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:23,425
I'm back.

312
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,836
I-I'm going to clap
my hands right now.

313
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:29,469
Then you're going to
wake up from your trance.

314
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:34,072
Nina!

315
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,043
I-It's all right.

316
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:44,918
Did I say something
terrible just now?

317
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:46,018
No.

318
00:21:46,193 --> 00:21:49,652
While you were hypnotized,
you refused to talk about it.

319
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:53,023
But you remember everything now,
don't you?

320
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:05,675
<i>Dr. Reichwein, Dieter...</i>

321
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:08,772
<i>Please forgive me
for leaving suddenly.</i>

322
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:12,551
<i>I'm going to Frankfurt,
where Tenma is.</i>

323
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:15,752
<i>I know everything.</i>

324
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:22,388
<i>Who I am. Where Johan has
come from and where he's headed.</i>

325
00:22:23,663 --> 00:22:26,826
<i>If I go, I can end everything.</i>

326
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:31,296
<i>If I go, I can save Tenma.</i>
