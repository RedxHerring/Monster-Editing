1
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:32,485
You saw Johan, huh?

2
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,620
I guess...I should kill you.

3
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:36,369
It seems I've seen something
I really shouldn't have.

4
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:41,209
That handsome blond I saw
that night in Düsseldorf...

5
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:45,577
Death to all who see Johan...is that it?

6
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:55,025
I heard three gunshots.
I became afraid and ran away.

7
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:59,328
I thought that Dr. Tenma
had been shot.

8
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:04,700
But the following day,
there was an article in the paper

9
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:08,003
that said that a man called Junkers
had died from three gun shots.

10
00:03:09,677 --> 00:03:11,008
He did it, didn't he?

11
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:15,174
Is it all right if you shoot me?

12
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,264
If you shoot me,

13
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:23,815
you'll never be able to get
the photograph of Johan as a child.

14
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,882
The thing that you were looking for...

15
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:29,390
What do you think would happen
if you shoot me?

16
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:35,461
I arranged it so the photograph would
automatically go to a BKA agent.

17
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:40,604
If you want that photograph,
tell me where Tenma is.

18
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:54,546
What's so funny?!

19
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:56,855
Your legs are shaking.

20
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:02,886
You act tough, but you can
barely stand, can you?

21
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,035
What an amusing woman.

22
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:13,737
I'll tell you.

23
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:16,740
What is Tenma doing?!

24
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:19,078
He's practicing medicine, of course.

25
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,204
But without a license.

26
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,075
Where?!

27
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:24,074
There's a man in Hanover

28
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:28,088
who's the number-two man
of a certain syndicate.

29
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,624
His boss feared him
and tried to have him killed.

30
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:35,219
But he failed and
only left him wounded.

31
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:43,094
So Tenma is taking care of this man
at a mountain villa near Füssen.

32
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:12,088
Why are you just standing there?

33
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:22,232
It's almost lunch time.

34
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:35,954
What are you doing?

35
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:37,491
Well...

36
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:40,283
The weather's nice.

37
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:43,129
I thought of having lunch outside.

38
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:45,362
Lunch outside?

39
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,234
Dieter, bring the plates.

40
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,937
Okay.

41
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:56,236
Your wounds are healing well.
You should get some sun.

42
00:05:57,812 --> 00:06:02,249
Dr. Tenma, you saved my life.

43
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:07,450
You treated me brilliantly
at that run-down country clinic.

44
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:12,993
Well, your head was just grazed
and the bullet went through your leg.

45
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:15,794
Your anterior tibial artery
was unharmed.

46
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:17,956
You're lucky.

47
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:22,125
Lucky, huh?!

48
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:25,163
Now then, it's finished cooking.

49
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:27,538
Wow, that smells good!

50
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:34,638
What do you think? It's good, isn't it?

51
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,448
Though Heckel doesn't look it,
he's quite the chef.

52
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:41,677
What do you mean by that?!

53
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,457
This is Chicken Marengo.

54
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,152
The sauce is the key.

55
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:51,389
It's a recipe from Le Petite Besson,
a three-star restaurant.

56
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,456
Your explanations are
always long-winded.

57
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:56,469
Kids can't appreciate
this attention to detail.

58
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:59,741
It looks like it would taste even better
if you poured a little soy sauce on it.

59
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:02,566
You put soy sauce on everything.

60
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:04,202
Do you have a problem
with the way I flavor my food?!

61
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:06,643
This is dining.

62
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:10,676
This is what dining should be like.

63
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,979
I did anything to make money.

64
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:21,551
What did I want to do with that money
once I had it?

65
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:26,024
I abandoned my parents,
became enemies with my siblings,

66
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,761
and my wife and child were killed.

67
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,367
All I wanted was to sit down
and dine like this.

68
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,784
Money makes people go mad.

69
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:49,656
Did you ever hear this story?

70
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:57,222
Five years ago,
a bank-like organization was formed

71
00:07:57,298 --> 00:08:00,427
to control Germany's
underground funds.

72
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:03,936
The work it did was impressive.

73
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:06,999
Dirty money flowed in from
underground companies

74
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,705
and suddenly became clean money.

75
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:12,206
Money laundering, huh?

76
00:08:12,713 --> 00:08:13,339
That's right.

77
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:19,479
It made loans and other transactions
as if it were a real bank.

78
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,248
It grew quite large.

79
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,652
They made a huge fortune
in just five years.

80
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:26,994
Whoa...

81
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:31,796
But this year, the person at the top
who was controlling things,

82
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:34,301
suddenly disappeared.

83
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:36,894
What do you think happened?

84
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:42,970
It was chaos. Beyond imagination.

85
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:49,248
Those who were left,
fiercely fought over the funds.

86
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:54,953
Most of them died
and the organization collapsed.

87
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,884
They should have just
sat around a table and had a meal.

88
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:05,958
So...

89
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:09,470
Where do you think he ran off to?

90
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:10,630
Huh?

91
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:13,770
Well, that man who disappeared.

92
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:16,536
Do you suppose he was killed?

93
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:19,914
No...he's alive somewhere.

94
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:24,174
He might even
be a student somewhere.

95
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:25,685
A student?

96
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:29,146
Yeah. It's surprising.

97
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,124
According to rumors,
that man...No, that kid,

98
00:09:33,194 --> 00:09:38,928
was only fifteen when he started
the syndicate five years ago.

99
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:46,304
At fifteen?!

100
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:49,165
That's just silly!

101
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,439
What could a kid do?!

102
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:55,744
But he did it. It was as if he was
conducting an experiment

103
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:58,376
to see how adults treat money.

104
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,281
It was like how a child plays
with a line of ants.

105
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,084
Where...

106
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,961
Where was that underground bank?

107
00:10:09,597 --> 00:10:12,430
The organization was
based in Düsseldorf,

108
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,367
but the man at the top
constantly moved around

109
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:18,303
and gave orders
from various locations.

110
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:23,506
Where was he when
he gave his final orders?

111
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:26,079
I don't know the details,

112
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:31,142
but those money-hungry subordinates
all rushed to Munich.

113
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:33,253
Munich...

114
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,985
What's wrong? Doctor, you look pale.

115
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:40,926
Say, let's call that man further down
to have lunch with us.

116
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:44,089
Y-Yeah. That's right!

117
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:48,397
Sorry, but my bodyguard
has a job to do.

118
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,068
You're already considered dead.

119
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:55,366
Do you think people are still
going to come after you?

120
00:10:56,243 --> 00:11:00,476
Do you plan to continue
living with guards?

121
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:16,162
He's been with me for a long time.

122
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:19,994
Boy... Bring Helmut.

123
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:23,033
So that man's name is Helmut!

124
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,035
Yeah. Tell him that his job
as a bodyguard is finished.

125
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:33,211
He's the last of my family...

126
00:11:33,914 --> 00:11:35,211
Tell him that we're going to

127
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:38,377
talk about what we're going to do
from here on at this table.

128
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:39,578
Okay!

129
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:07,214
Mr. Helmut! It's lunch time!

130
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:08,915
Everyone's waiting for you!

131
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:16,353
Tenma's waiting at
the mountain villa.

132
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:19,890
You want to kill him don't you?

133
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:34,567
What is it?

134
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:38,302
Something happened to Helmut
at the bottom of the hill.

135
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:39,171
What?!

136
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:43,140
Helmut is probably already...

137
00:12:45,786 --> 00:12:47,083
I-Is it one of the guys after you?

138
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:49,747
I don't know...but...

139
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:52,884
Someone's headed towards
this villa.

140
00:12:55,229 --> 00:12:57,163
Mr. Helmut!

141
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:42,635
Tell him...

142
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,036
Huh?

143
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:46,511
Run away quickly.

144
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:50,383
Tell him to run away quickly.

145
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:52,786
Quickly!

146
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,920
M-Ma'am!

147
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:02,322
G-Go quickly.

148
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:04,190
But your leg!

149
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:05,856
J-Just do it now!

150
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:06,892
Which way?

151
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:08,931
Which direction were you shot from?

152
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,801
D-Did you hit him?

153
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:18,702
I don't know. Nevermind.
Go right now!

154
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,074
I can't!

155
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:22,612
You'll be shot if you stay here!

156
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:25,251
Don't worry about me. Go quickly!

157
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:28,753
I can't! We've got to
hide in the bushes!

158
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,316
What's this? That woman...

159
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:36,586
...didn't want to kill Tenma after all.

160
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,668
Are you all right, ma'am?

161
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:47,570
I'm all right...but I wonder
if he's gone up already.

162
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:53,210
No. This is the only route
to get to the villa.

163
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:54,914
What do you mean?

164
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:57,777
I've gone up and down this mountain
many times.

165
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:00,680
The other paths lead to cliffs
that you can't climb.

166
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:06,858
Which means that if we keep watch
from here, he can't go further up.

167
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:08,819
Who is he?

168
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:10,363
Roberto.

169
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:13,296
He wants to kill Tenma.

170
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:14,934
Tenma?!

171
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:17,300
Who are you, ma'am?
Are you a friend of Tenma's?

172
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:26,374
What's so funny?

173
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:29,082
I'm not old enough
to be called "ma'am"!

174
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,744
Now, quickly! Go to Tenma
and tell him to run away!

175
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:36,950
But...ma...I mean, Miss, you're...

176
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:39,554
I'm telling you, I'm all right.

177
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,854
But all that blood is coming out.

178
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:44,888
Tenma should have
heard those gunshots.

179
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,262
He should come to save us soon!

180
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:51,998
Don't you understand,
that guy...Roberto is after Tenma?

181
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:55,606
He wants Tenma to come here.

182
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:00,378
But ma'am, if we run away like this,
you're going to bleed to death!

183
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:02,680
I said that I'm not old enough
to be called "ma'am"!

184
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,954
What are you to Tenma?

185
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:12,156
A friend.
What about you, Ma...Miss?

186
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:17,389
You're Tenma's friend, aren't you?

187
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:21,362
You're getting hurt trying to save him.

188
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:25,030
You like Tenma, don't you?

189
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,298
Are you Tenma's girlfriend?

190
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:29,739
Keep watch over there!

191
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:35,943
Do you like Tenma?

192
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:37,782
Yeah, I like him a lot.

193
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:39,977
What do you like about him?

194
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:43,056
What about you?
Why do you like him?

195
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:51,231
Roberto!

196
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:55,058
Don't bother trying to shoot me
from the bushes!

197
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:56,603
I told you!

198
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,474
I set it up so the photograph that
you want of Johan will automatically

199
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:04,910
go to a BKA agent if I die!

200
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:09,444
Get out of here if you
want the photograph!

201
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:16,151
You have something over him,
don't you?

202
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,567
It's a lie.

203
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:18,217
Huh?

204
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:22,352
He might not fall for such a lie.

205
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,560
Are you all right, Miss?

206
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,829
Of course I'm not all right.

207
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:34,100
You...Run away by yourself.

208
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,333
I can't do that.

209
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:37,672
Tenma will come soon.

210
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:39,208
He won't come!

211
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:41,574
That's not true. Tenma is...

212
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:44,879
He won't come to save me.

213
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,687
He won't come.

214
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:53,393
Dieter!

215
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:55,589
Dieter, where are you?!

216
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:00,026
Tenma, I'm over here!

217
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:01,601
I'm going right now!

218
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:03,731
Stay right there!

219
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:05,271
Don't come!

220
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,799
He's going to shoot you
if you come right now!

221
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:12,475
He's here to kill you!

222
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:15,511
Th-That voice. It can't be.

223
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:18,981
This lady is one
of your acquaintances!

224
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,477
She's been shot. Blood's gushing out!

225
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,582
Eva...

226
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:26,989
I can't let you die now!

227
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:31,628
My dream is to turn you
into the police alive!

228
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:35,963
And live the rest of your life
in jail with regret!

229
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:39,570
Regret for the rest of your life
that you dumped me!

230
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,072
You shouldn't talk so loudly.

231
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,877
Dieter, can you hear me? Dieter!

232
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:53,045
Can you tell where the enemy
is from where you are?

233
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:56,646
I don't know!

234
00:18:57,024 --> 00:19:00,050
I don't know where he's shooting from!

235
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:06,655
Don't come. I can't have you die.

236
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:11,061
Hang on, Ma'am!

237
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,131
He won't come.

238
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,270
Not to save me.

239
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:21,538
He won't come.

240
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:22,615
Ma'am!

241
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:33,585
He won't...come.

242
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,454
Tenma...

243
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,050
What are you doing?

244
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:09,796
Lunch.

245
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:12,756
Your wounds are healing nicely.

246
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:16,801
You can now eat lunch
in this weather.

247
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:19,403
You're lucky.

248
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,207
Lucky?

249
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:26,042
Yeah. The man who shot you
was quite a pro.

250
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:29,882
He calmly determined
how difficult it would be

251
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,748
to break into this mountain villa.

252
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:34,981
There was only one route
to get here.

253
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:37,587
There were security systems
everywhere.

254
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,687
It was clear that if there were people
with weapons at the villa,

255
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:43,821
he wouldn't be able to fight them off.

256
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:46,760
That's why he used you.

257
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,057
He used me?

258
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:57,242
That's right. The only way to get in
was to have a woman wander in.

259
00:20:57,978 --> 00:20:59,844
But you betrayed him.

260
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:03,278
That was the end of his plan.

261
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:06,048
He left in a hurry.

262
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:07,854
He left?

263
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:12,016
That's right. He wasn't in the bushes.

264
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,652
This is called Chicken Marengo.

265
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:21,331
I tried to duplicate the recipe,
so I can't guarantee it's any good.

266
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:25,233
There's one more thing
you were lucky about.

267
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,776
You had a great doctor
like Dr. Tenma treat you.

268
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:35,839
Where is Tenma?

269
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,242
He already left.

270
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:39,278
Where did he go?

271
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:41,845
He was interested in Munich.

272
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:43,756
Munich...

273
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:51,256
Now, let's eat.

274
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:53,824
It seems that, like me,

275
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,304
you've forgotten how to sit
and dine like this.
