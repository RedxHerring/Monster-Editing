1
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:08,996
Help...

2
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:12,962
If I don't let everyone know soon,
my baby will die...

3
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:18,602
I heard them talking.

4
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:22,575
They're going to set a fire...
tomorrow night...

5
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:27,512
They plan on burning our town.. .
the Turkish town!

6
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:29,750
Help!

7
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:36,817
If I don't let everyone know soon,
they'll burn my town. ..my baby!

8
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,851
Where the hell
are you going, Brat?!

9
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:15,366
I know the true worth
of the rug in the antique shop.

10
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,051
I should be the one to have it.

11
00:02:19,527 --> 00:02:22,428
I told you not to look
at adults like that!

12
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:23,623
Thief.

13
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,767
Do whatever you want!

14
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:29,960
When I make a fortune, I won't
give you anything good to eat.

15
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:31,965
Listen up!

16
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,174
If you tell someone, you'll pay!

17
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:39,011
I won't ever be friends with a thief...

18
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:41,248
Ever...

19
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:49,586
I'm hungry...

20
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:54,288
There, there.
Don't cry, don't cry...

21
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,888
Mama's going to come back soon.

22
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:59,095
Doesn't that kid have a mama?

23
00:03:00,168 --> 00:03:00,794
Yeah.

24
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:05,072
What about you? Don't stay there.
Return to your mama.

25
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:13,578
Oh... Could it be that you don't
have a mama, either?

26
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:17,249
Sorry. I said something bad.

27
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,679
It's all right... I have Tenma.

28
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:20,954
Tenma?

29
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:28,328
Eat as much as you want...

30
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:31,229
It's nothing special,
but don't hold back.

31
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:37,537
So you're waiting for Tenma
to come back...

32
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,731
You're the same as that kid...

33
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:44,539
Where did that kid's mama go?

34
00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:47,747
Bad guys caught her.

35
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:49,016
Bad guys?!

36
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:52,181
It's really dangerous out there.

37
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,182
An Asian who was about to help me

38
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:57,053
was run over by them
right before my eyes.

39
00:03:58,192 --> 00:03:59,182
Asian?

40
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,791
Oh, you said that Tenma
was Japanese, didn't you?

41
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:05,097
But... It can't be...

42
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,328
I'll go ! Where is it?!

43
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:11,699
My customer...

44
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:15,436
That man was a member of
an extreme right wing group.

45
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:18,708
I left the room
once I finished my job...

46
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:23,213
But I forgot my scarf,
so I went back to get it...

47
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:27,186
That man. ..was talking to
a friend on the phone.

48
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,848
I ran away. ..to try to
tell everyone in town.

49
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,986
But I was caught. ..
and brought here...

50
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,227
My child is still small. ..
He can't run away if there's a fire...

51
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,065
Who is it?

52
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:50,200
I was told by Professor Geidlitz
to send you some fruit...

53
00:04:53,114 --> 00:04:53,740
Thank you.

54
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:56,841
I have a message from the professor.

55
00:04:57,318 --> 00:05:00,686
General Wolf will be here shortly.

56
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,591
The man who was in the photograph
with my brother?

57
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:09,026
Yes. .. He's the one who
knows Johan the best.

58
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,995
Probably even better than you do...

59
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:14,824
That's what the professor said.

60
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,802
Whoops. You mustn't die yet!

61
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,345
His Excellency General Wolf
will be coming soon.

62
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:30,143
I want him to see what a good job
I've done by capturing you.

63
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,179
Wolf...

64
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:36,056
Refer to him as, "His Excellency"!

65
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,863
<i>Look for General Wolf. He's the one
who first discovered Johan's skill...</i>

66
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:52,264
It's like a dream to be receiving praise
from His Excellency.

67
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:53,941
Excuse me.

68
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:58,172
We've gathered the members
who will set fire to the Turkish town.

69
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:00,838
Are there any changes to the plan?

70
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:03,449
Everything's going as planned...

71
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:07,044
I'm going to have dinner
while I watch the red sky.

72
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:11,718
My fun dinner will be ruined
if the timing is off, even just a little...

73
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:16,323
Tell them that they'll be punished
if they can't do things as planned.

74
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:17,090
Yes!

75
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:20,532
Johan will not lead you.

76
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:26,531
It'll be impossible to have Johan
lead your organization.

77
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:35,382
He isn't as racist
or prejudiced like you.

78
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:39,743
Johan laughs scornfully at all people.

79
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:42,752
Shut up!

80
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,799
What an unusual customer.

81
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:59,129
Give this customer a drink on me.
The usual.

82
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:00,230
Okay.

83
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:26,096
That's quite impressive.

84
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,659
He'll be quite the troublemaker.

85
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,836
Disgusting! How can they
drink those things?

86
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:40,844
Tenma's jacket...

87
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:49,381
Tenma...

88
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:53,519
Where are you?

89
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,361
Tenma...

90
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:06,001
Well, calm down.

91
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:08,675
I want to get you out of that room,

92
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:10,871
but I'm not in the position
to do anything right now...

93
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:15,946
So I'll get out and warn your town.

94
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,781
R-Really?

95
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,281
What's the name of
the street you live on?

96
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:21,952
Calvin Street...

97
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:24,351
Calvin Street? What's your name?

98
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,592
Ayse.

99
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,057
Ayse, it's all right!
Your baby will be saved!

100
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:32,128
You'll be saved soon, as well.

101
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,529
Keep it up until then.
Understand?

102
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,294
Thank you...

103
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:40,908
Oh... What's your name?

104
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:45,373
Nina... Let's meet when I save you.

105
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:51,448
Nina... I've had a terrible time
since I came to Germany,

106
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,454
but you're the first good person
I've met...

107
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,350
We're friends, aren't we?

108
00:08:58,893 --> 00:08:59,519
Yeah...

109
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:02,993
Say, what's the name of your baby?

110
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:08,196
Ayse? Ayse?

111
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,037
- Stop!
- Ayse?!

112
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:16,703
Ayse!

113
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:19,338
Sto...

114
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:22,141
Ayse!

115
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:36,651
Is that Tenma?

116
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:37,958
Yes.

117
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:40,259
I caught him...

118
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:42,460
Huh? Where is His Excellency?

119
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:44,729
He's waiting somewhere else.

120
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:46,666
We're going to take this man.

121
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:50,737
Huh–? Oh, but, this is my prize.

122
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:53,933
I was going to kill him
after I showed him to His Excellency...

123
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:55,675
What should I do with this kid?

124
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:56,369
Huh?

125
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,280
He said that he came looking
for this man.

126
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:02,707
Oh? Is he someone you know?

127
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:08,681
I-I don't know him.
I don't know this child. Let him go.

128
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,852
I can't take a filthy child like this
with me

129
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:14,122
when I go to see
His Excellency.

130
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:16,158
Get rid of him.

131
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:17,822
S-Stop!

132
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:22,663
Shut up. Do it right now.
It's noisy.

133
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,496
Okay.

134
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:27,200
Stop!

135
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:49,428
T-That's...my subordinate...

136
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:55,661
Doctor Tenma...

137
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:58,762
Forgive us for the rude treatment
you've received.

138
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:02,432
You are General Wolf's
important guest.

139
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:21,254
Ayse...

140
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:32,633
<i>If I don't let everyone know soon,</i>

141
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:37,109
<i>my town...my baby
will be burned by them!</i>

142
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:41,878
<i>We're friends, aren't we?</i>

143
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,274
<i>That's right, Ayse...</i>

144
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:45,952
<i>We're...</i>

145
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,187
<i>...friends!</i>

146
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:48,548
Huh?!

147
00:12:58,732 --> 00:13:00,757
W-What's the meaning of this?

148
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:23,288
Professor Geidlitz...

149
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:39,033
Everyone's...dead...

150
00:13:44,378 --> 00:13:48,474
We'll soon be arriving at the house
where General Wolf is waiting.

151
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:50,743
Is Nina there?

152
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:52,584
Yes, do not worry...

153
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,046
She's as important a guest as you
are.

154
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,217
Where's the Turkish woman?

155
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,592
Who knows...?

156
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:03,525
We don't know anything outside of
what we were ordered to do.

157
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:06,466
We've got to go to the town!

158
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,493
Calvin Street is going to burn tonight,
isn't it?!

159
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:11,769
If we don't let everyone
in the town know

160
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,332
the lady who fed me,
and that baby are going to die!

161
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,075
Unfortunately...

162
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:21,907
Our job is to take you with us.

163
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,383
Stop the car!

164
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:25,845
Tenma!

165
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,224
Can you go to
the Turkish town alone?

166
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:32,952
Huh?!

167
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:33,652
I'll go afterwards!

168
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:36,256
But right now, I have to go.

169
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:37,023
But...

170
00:14:37,531 --> 00:14:38,521
You can do it.

171
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,766
You're a man, aren't you?!

172
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,828
If you go, everyone on Calvin Street
will be saved.

173
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,896
Go quickly!

174
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:45,998
Okay!

175
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:49,773
If you catch a car,
it should be thirty minutes!

176
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:57,510
Sorry for being rough. Go.

177
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:02,779
It's your fault for trusting me,
and giving back my gun.

178
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:05,624
But it didn't look like
you were going to stop.

179
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,886
It's okay...

180
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:13,997
General Wolf will be pleased to know
that your gun isn't just an accessory.

181
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:24,738
Right this way.

182
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:25,671
Where's Nina?

183
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:26,803
She's in this house, isn't she?

184
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:27,840
Let me see her.

185
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:33,179
First, we want you to meet
General Wolf and Professor Geidlitz.

186
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,387
First, I want to know if she's safe!

187
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,484
Geidlitz is dead.

188
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:44,395
Not only Geidlitz...

189
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,634
All of his subordinates
were also killed.

190
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,670
I've dealt with the bodies.

191
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:53,833
Where's Nina?!

192
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:59,303
She wasn't here when we came
with General Wolf.

193
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:02,881
You're Dr. Tenma, aren't you?

194
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,652
Wh-Who are you?

195
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:15,321
You probably wouldn't recognize me
even if you saw my face...

196
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:22,164
Thank you for coming. I am Wolf.

197
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:25,265
B-But...

198
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:28,705
You look like
an entirely different person

199
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:29,742
from the picture
taken ten years ago...

200
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:34,614
It's fear...

201
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:38,645
It's fear.

202
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:44,287
Can't you go any faster?

203
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,688
Don't be foolish.
I'm going at 200 kilometers.

204
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,986
200 kilometers?

205
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:49,955
That speedometer is broken!

206
00:16:50,397 --> 00:16:53,025
I won't make it in time!

207
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:59,397
People's names are mysterious...

208
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:06,269
The people that I've met,
know that my name is Wolf.

209
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:15,053
But I have to give my name
to those who I don't know...

210
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:22,156
But...where is the proof
that I am Wolf?

211
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:26,225
You're the one that discovered
Johan, aren't you?

212
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,862
Yes. It was 12 years ago...

213
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,800
He was sent to 511 Kinderheim
and was raised to become

214
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:38,004
an East German advance guard...
No, a leader...

215
00:17:38,745 --> 00:17:42,238
That's right... He was to become
the person who'd support

216
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:44,307
this country before it's downfall.

217
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:48,354
And now, you want to make him into
the next Hitler

218
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,584
to expand your
extreme right-wing organization!

219
00:17:57,364 --> 00:18:01,562
Right now, I'm only affiliated with
this organization out of convenience.

220
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:06,773
Everyone else wants to turn him
into another Hitler, but...

221
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:09,539
That's a stupid idea.

222
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:17,108
Someone like Hitler
took things that far...

223
00:18:17,684 --> 00:18:19,243
If it were Johan...

224
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:21,647
That's right...

225
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:25,086
I was the one who gave him
the name "Johan."

226
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,593
We took the siblings into custody

227
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:33,224
as they were walking near
the Czechoslovakian border.

228
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:38,298
They surpassed
the heavy border security

229
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:43,139
and walked on; malnourished
and dying from the cold.

230
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:49,176
They passed out soon after
we took them into custody.

231
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,848
They probably would have died
if we hadn't found them...

232
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:58,552
It's the same as when you
saved Johan's life.

233
00:19:03,163 --> 00:19:10,297
When he regained consciousness,
I asked him, "How do you feel?"

234
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:12,965
He replied...

235
00:19:14,174 --> 00:19:16,802
"You'll know soon."

236
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:25,076
I have no proof that I am Wolf.

237
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,149
The people who know me

238
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:31,555
disappeared from the world
one by one...

239
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:38,895
My wife, children, parents, siblings,
relatives, subordinates, and friends

240
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:41,161
died one by one...

241
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:44,695
Johan did it all.

242
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:51,043
The only thing that can prove
that I am Wolf

243
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:54,012
is the large sum of money
that I brought with me

244
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:55,480
when I escaped
from East Germany.

245
00:19:56,349 --> 00:20:01,753
Aside from those who believe
who I am, no one knows who I am.

246
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,719
"You'll know soon..."

247
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,785
This is what it meant.

248
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:09,921
Solitude...

249
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:14,066
Take a look at this.

250
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:19,734
"I'll be waiting at
the abandoned warehouse

251
00:20:19,806 --> 00:20:21,535
of Hilden and Engels Company
in Romberg..."

252
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:24,735
Johan was here this morning.

253
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:29,674
And he killed Geidlitz
and his subordinates.

254
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:34,546
Now, one more person
who knew me has disappeared...

255
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:42,190
Nina probably saw this message
and headed there...

256
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:45,823
I want you to kill him!

257
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,104
What?! Is that true?!

258
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,675
It's true!

259
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:58,006
We have to let the people
of Calvin Street know immediately.

260
00:20:58,745 --> 00:20:59,735
How amazing.

261
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:02,673
Luck has finally turned in my favor!

262
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:03,375
Huh?

263
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,181
I can use the fire to get the rug
for myself...

264
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:08,445
I'm lucky!

265
00:21:08,688 --> 00:21:09,849
Looter!

266
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:13,052
Y-You idiot. Not so loud!

267
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:14,718
It would be bad if someone heard!

268
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:16,224
Let go of me!

269
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,829
It's not just the people of this town.

270
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:21,266
- We'll be dead if...
- Let go of me!

271
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:22,961
- ...the right wingers find out.
- Let go...

272
00:21:23,603 --> 00:21:25,298
Especially skinheads...

273
00:21:25,372 --> 00:21:27,864
- ...with swastika tattoos...
- Let go of me...

274
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,251
Was there a Turkish woman
imprisoned here?

275
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:45,523
That woman was dead
on the third floor.

276
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:48,361
Johan did not kill her.

277
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:51,023
It was the work of
Professor Geidlitz's subordinates.

278
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:57,827
Can that man kill Johan?

279
00:21:58,271 --> 00:21:59,238
I don't know...

280
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:04,035
But... There still might be time.

281
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:30,662
What is this?
