1
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:23,406
Amazing.

2
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:32,275
It's all right.
Never again...

3
00:00:33,187 --> 00:00:36,885
Never again will blood be spilled
in this forest ever again.

4
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:39,351
Isn't that right?

5
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:14,212
You don't remember anything?

6
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,181
What were you doing on the roof?

7
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:23,246
Tell me anything you can remember.

8
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:26,022
Talk to him, Martin!

9
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:28,956
If you hadn't hit the eaves
on the first floor

10
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,624
and gotten caught in that tree,
you would have died!

11
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,200
Talk to the doctor!

12
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,262
We have to bring an end
to this foolishness!

13
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:40,000
Now, now, ma'am.

14
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:45,170
But if he were to die, I...I...

15
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,448
Listen, ma'am.

16
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:51,174
I've come to counsel your son.

17
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:55,748
I know. I know. But...Doctor...

18
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:59,289
Let's talk outside, ma'am.

19
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:17,011
Dieter, stay right there.
Don't go into the room.

20
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:21,043
Is he your grandson?

21
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:24,048
No. I'm just taking care of him
for a bit.

22
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:05,859
H-Hey.

23
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:07,787
Hey.

24
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,978
I'm Dieter.

25
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:27,511
I'm Martin.

26
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:29,806
Does it hurt?

27
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:31,985
Does what?

28
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,947
Those wounds the ones
that are bandaged.

29
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,692
Was it scary when
you fell off the roof?

30
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:46,525
N-No, what are you doing?!

31
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:50,728
My shoes are in that bag.
Get them for me!

32
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:53,698
What are you saying?
You've got to lie down!

33
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,071
Get my shoes!

34
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:06,747
Where are you going?
You'll get scolded.

35
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:09,752
So what if someone scolds me?

36
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:14,423
It's not as if I'm afraid to get scolded.

37
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,965
Ah! It's just as he said.

38
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:24,528
If you come back to life, go outside.
The world will be different. "

39
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:30,209
No, the world hasn't changed. I have.

40
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:41,949
That's because...I was chosen.

41
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:57,168
Boring.

42
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:04,471
I never knew that this world
was so boring.

43
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:12,745
Oh! Look out...

44
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:27,893
Come on.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

45
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:56,621
H-How could you do that?!

46
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:03,333
Hey, look! He's afraid!

47
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:04,995
S-Stop that!

48
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:07,104
I'm telling you to look.

49
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:14,879
I don't want to die!
Help me! Is that it?

50
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:21,847
Fine. I'll let you live.

51
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:40,372
I'll answer your question.

52
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:41,400
Huh?

53
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:45,644
You asked if I was afraid
when I fell off the roof, didn't you?

54
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:47,547
Y-Yeah...

55
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:52,185
Of course I wasn't afraid.
It was a game.

56
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:55,055
A-A game?!

57
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:58,454
B-But several people have died!

58
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:04,064
It's fun. It's just a game.

59
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,736
Two people face each other on the ledge
of the roof of an empty building.

60
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:14,133
Then they close their eyes and walk
towards each other, one step at a time.

61
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:16,710
It's a duel!

62
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:20,437
It doesn't matter if you fall or do anything.
You win so long as you survive.

63
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:22,782
Why would you do that?

64
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:28,953
To bet on your fate.
The survivors are the chosen ones.

65
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,350
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

66
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:37,189
The survivors can play again.

67
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:40,625
Play... Play?

68
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:43,268
The world is boring.

69
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:49,676
It's fun. Only the chosen ones
can keep on playing.

70
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,109
Don't you see?

71
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:57,049
I thought you were one of us.

72
00:09:57,585 --> 00:09:58,882
Come, I'll show you.

73
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:03,655
If you see it and you still don't get it,
you really are an idiot.

74
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:16,028
H-Hey, you're not planning
to go to the roof, are you?

75
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:18,069
The chosen ones...

76
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,573
The superior survive...

77
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:22,540
That's what he is.

78
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,068
Who's "he"?

79
00:10:24,512 --> 00:10:26,742
The person who taught me this game.

80
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:28,181
Who is he?

81
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:33,182
A friend to all of us superior children.

82
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,254
Now, hurry up and come!

83
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:38,881
L-I don't want to.

84
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:40,516
Just come!

85
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:41,891
Let go!

86
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:43,794
You should understand. Come!

87
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:45,031
Stop!

88
00:10:48,435 --> 00:10:50,870
Those scars...
Who did that to you?

89
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:53,701
Was it your parents?!

90
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:57,307
Do you plan to stay with them
even though they did this to you?

91
00:10:57,878 --> 00:11:00,472
Do you still plan to stay
in this worthless world

92
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:01,845
even though they did this to you?

93
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:04,184
Come! Come and see!

94
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,389
What do you think of the view
from here?

95
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:16,594
How does it feel?

96
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:22,401
Stand up. What are you afraid of?

97
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:25,533
Stand up, close your eyes and walk.

98
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:29,034
Stand up!

99
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,840
All right. I understand what
you're talking about.

100
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:37,576
What?

101
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:41,949
I thought that the world was dark.

102
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,191
I thought that the future was dark.

103
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,497
What's your favorite food?

104
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,934
Recently, I ate a really
delicious sausage!

105
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:57,634
But if I died, I'd no longer
be able to eat it again!

106
00:11:58,405 --> 00:11:59,634
Coward.

107
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,108
I like soccer!

108
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:04,539
But if I died, I'd no longer be able
to kick around a ball!

109
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:05,845
Weakling.

110
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:07,980
I like Doctor Reichwein!

111
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:10,779
His secretary, Mereth, is a kind person!

112
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,580
But if I died, I'd no longer
be able to see them!

113
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,990
Scary things will never go away!

114
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:20,492
That's why he said we grow up!

115
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:24,989
He said that tomorrow will be a good day!
Tenma said that!

116
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,831
If I died. If I died, I'd no longer
be able to see Tenma.

117
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:49,986
I'm scared!

118
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,167
Don't panic.
Get on your knees slowly.

119
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:10,367
I can't be like him.

120
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:15,641
I can't be like Johan.

121
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,217
Johan?!

122
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:20,950
Johan is playing an even
more terrifying game!

123
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:24,691
Johan said that he was going
to be killed soon!

124
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:30,324
He said that he was going to
be shot by a Japanese man soon!

125
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,708
I closed my eyes and
walked across the ledge of the roof.

126
00:13:43,277 --> 00:13:45,336
It's true. I walked across!

127
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,670
I wasn't scared at all!

128
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:50,176
Joachim was supposed to be
walking across from me.

129
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,548
But when I opened my eyes,
he had disappeared!

130
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,457
I saw it! I saw someone die
with my own eyes!

131
00:13:57,991 --> 00:13:59,481
People really do die.

132
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,455
Have some tea.

133
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:05,094
Oh, thank you.

134
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:10,463
Honestly! He doesn't seem
to realize what he's done.

135
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:16,075
I'm glad he's alive, but when I think of
what Joachim's parents are going through.

136
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,776
Please say something to him!

137
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:24,240
He'll listen to you.

138
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,981
She complains to me like that every day.

139
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,759
She doesn't understand
anything at all.

140
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:35,056
She won't let me out of the house,

141
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,961
and I'm not allowed
to watch TV or read comics.

142
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:38,889
You seem bored.

143
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:41,899
I'll bring you something.

144
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:43,603
What?!
Really?

145
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:47,469
Comics aren't allowed,
but a picture book is all right, isn't it?

146
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:51,677
A picture book?
That's boring.

147
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,750
Say, what about that terrifying game
you were talking about?

148
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:03,350
You said that you were going
to be shot dead soon!

149
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:05,052
This is exciting.

150
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:06,393
When is it going to happen?

151
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:08,493
When is that Japanese man
going to shoot you?!

152
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:10,025
Hey, Johan!

153
00:15:20,073 --> 00:15:23,668
Hermann Hesse.
A first edition of <i>Steppenwolf!</i>

154
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:27,741
And this! A first edition of
Hoffmann's <i>Night Pieces.</i>

155
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:30,645
There's a complete collection
of Goethe's poems.

156
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:33,082
Impressive.

157
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:36,352
Even as the head librarian
of the University of Munich,

158
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:41,122
Freidrich Emmanuel Campus Library,
I am dazzled by this collection!

159
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:44,191
I didn't go to college.

160
00:15:44,264 --> 00:15:46,460
I've come this far through
educating myself.

161
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:50,828
I thought that I should at least read.

162
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:56,209
I never expected you to donate
such a collection to our library.

163
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:58,875
I cannot express my gratitude!

164
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:03,876
I have become blind,
and can no longer read.

165
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:07,280
Rather than having these books
lay unread in this library,

166
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:10,550
they would be of more use
if they are with the students.

167
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:14,988
Yes! They're all valuable books,

168
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:17,190
but we're considering making them
available to the public.

169
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:21,128
Oh yes... We've already decided
where we'll store them.

170
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,701
There will be a ceremony as well,

171
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,637
so please come to the library
to discuss it with us.

172
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:28,299
How's the security?

173
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:29,335
Huh?

174
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,607
Ever since Mr. Schuwald
reentered public life,

175
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:35,376
we've been on the lookout
for dangerous groups.

176
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:39,146
Please check
your guest list thoroughly.

177
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,751
Right, Johan?!

178
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:43,081
Yes.

179
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,887
Johan and Karl thought
of donating this collection.

180
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,989
They should be the ones
to go to your library.

181
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,734
I'm Gherrmann, the head librarian.

182
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:57,370
Pleased to meet you.

183
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:00,931
Pleased to meet you.

184
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:14,378
This room is where we will store
Mr. Schuwald's collection.

185
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,024
The general public isn't allowed here.

186
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,557
You've never come here before,
have you?

187
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:24,253
Of course, the temperature and
humidity are perfect for storing books,

188
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:26,698
and we're also secure
against theft and fires.

189
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,465
What an amazing number of books.

190
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,029
It's a testament to mankind,
isn't it, Johan?

191
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:37,042
A testament to mankind...

192
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:46,683
And we plan to hold the donation
ceremony in this central hall.

193
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:51,754
The library will be tightly secured,
just as Mr Schuwald's butler requested.

194
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:54,825
I want Mr. Schuwald to feel safe.

195
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:59,328
Yes, my father would
be happy to attend.

196
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,067
Right, Johan?

197
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:22,589
What's wrong, Johan?

198
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:27,621
Excuse me for a second.

199
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:43,273
Are you looking for something?

200
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:44,637
Yes...

201
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,880
I was looking for
a good picture book for a friend.

202
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:52,442
A friend?

203
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,282
Yes. A friend.

204
00:18:56,223 --> 00:19:00,126
Well then, how about this one?

205
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:06,125
See? Aren't these wonderful pictures?!

206
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:12,369
Yes, these are nice.
But they're a bit grown-up.

207
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:16,170
Oh, your friend's not an adult?

208
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:18,907
Then what about this one?

209
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:24,980
Oh no...

210
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,519
Oh, thank you.

211
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,366
I'm so clumsy.
This always happens.

212
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:53,209
Yes, I recommend this one.

213
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,283
Do you like that one?

214
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:05,788
Oh... What nice pictures!
I wonder whose book it is?

215
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,417
Excuse me...

216
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:12,022
Emile...Scherbe?
Moravia Publishing.

217
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,858
It's a Czech publishing company
in Prague.

218
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:18,970
There are a lot of good
picture-book authors in Czechoslovakia.

219
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:22,474
But I've never heard of Scherbe.

220
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,078
Maybe he's not that famous.

221
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:33,786
What's wrong?

222
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,450
S-Somebody!

223
00:21:10,423 --> 00:21:11,822
Somebody, come help!

224
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:37,911
This summer heat is really terrible.

225
00:22:13,587 --> 00:22:14,554
Here...

226
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:30,629
From here, I'm going to...
