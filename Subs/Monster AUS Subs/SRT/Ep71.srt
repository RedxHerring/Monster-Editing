1
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:16,966
I don't want to do this to elderly
people... But you're important witnesses.

2
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:20,536
It would be bad if
you died or ran away.

3
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:26,174
The back entrance and
most of the windows

4
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:27,840
have been barricaded
with furniture.

5
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,580
But if someone really wanted to,
they could easily break through.

6
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:37,957
It's better than nothing.
Let's go to the first floor.

7
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:40,461
Do you know how to shoot?

8
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:42,323
Y-Yeah. Probably.

9
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,596
I'm going, too.

10
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:49,125
I have to go, too.

11
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:52,334
It would be bad if something
were to happen to you.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,674
You need to survive and
tell the world the truth.

13
00:01:08,923 --> 00:01:11,756
Wim, stay in the room.

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,727
If something
happens to you...

15
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,995
It's all right. There's no need to worry.
A strong ally is coming to save us.

16
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:20,427
Really?

17
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:22,136
Yeah, really.

18
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,602
He comes to save us
whenever we're in danger.

19
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:31,503
He never let's evil go unpunished.
He's the Magnificent Steiner.

20
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:13,043
Now! Run!

21
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,187
Take the path through
the woods to the north!

22
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,827
I'm pretty sure most of
the children have escaped now.

23
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:29,120
You go quickly, too!

24
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,190
I still haven't looked around
the center of the town.

25
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,898
Leave the rest to me.
You lead everyone to safety.

26
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,331
A-All right.

27
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:40,200
Oh. There's just one thing
I'd like to ask you...

28
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:45,240
Do you know Bonaparta.. .
no.. .Klaus Poppe?

29
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,647
Poppe?

30
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:50,151
Ah. He's the owner
of the Hotel Versteck.

31
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:21,379
What are you doing there?

32
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,147
Relax. I'm on your side

33
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:36,420
I ran away in a panic.
But the town is full of corpses.

34
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:39,556
I don't know where
I should run to.

35
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:41,558
Where did you run from?

36
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:45,536
H-He's giving orders
from his room.

37
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,365
I heard.

38
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:48,701
He?

39
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,134
Roberto!

40
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:53,737
I thought it was strange that he kept
coming and going from his room!

41
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:57,580
Each time, he'd change
his clothes and take a shower.

42
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:59,778
Where is this Roberto?

43
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:02,447
A room on the fourth floor
of the Hotel Bergbach.

44
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:08,288
I ...didn't know he was
that sort of person. I...

45
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:19,763
Listen. Everyone's hiding
in Hotel Versteck.

46
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:22,174
Can you get there
by yourself?

47
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:25,008
B-By myself? I'm scared.

48
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,478
Now, get up.

49
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:27,742
I-I'm scared.

50
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:51,635
Dr. Tenma...

51
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:54,374
Inspector Lunge...

52
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,871
My journey into delusion...
has finally become reality.

53
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:07,847
The emergence of you marks the end of
following what I thought were delusions.

54
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:11,324
My duty as a police officer
begins from this point on.

55
00:06:11,926 --> 00:06:13,587
I'm finally going back to work.

56
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:22,031
Take this girl to the Hotel Versteck.
The person you're after is there.

57
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:25,970
Franz.. .Bonaparta...

58
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:33,705
Inspector Lunge,
where are you going?

59
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,384
I told you, didn't I?
To work...

60
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,181
Let's talk when I get back.

61
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:42,448
There're a lot of things
I want to ask you about.

62
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,626
Dr. Tenma...

63
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,091
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:04,640
Are you all right, Nina?

65
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:06,743
My memory...

66
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:08,613
is trying to come out.

67
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:11,579
My deepest memory...

68
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:14,085
Your deepest memory?

69
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:15,646
I...

70
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:18,051
don't want to remember it.

71
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:26,728
This memory... Johan.. .
If Johan remembers this...

72
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:07,367
Come out.

73
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:10,310
D-Don't shoot.

74
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:16,740
I-I'm from this town.
Don't shoot me.

75
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:20,581
Where's is the man
who's giving you orders?

76
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:21,848
Huh?

77
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,962
I said, "Where's Roberto?"

78
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:47,741
Stand up. Walk.

79
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:51,082
I can't take it anymore.
There are dead bodies everywhere.

80
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:53,749
I'll go crazy here.

81
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:57,690
Then we've got to get to
Hotel Versteck as soon as possible.

82
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,351
No!

83
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:49,838
Open your eyes, Erika.

84
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:54,479
Please... Erika...

85
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,176
She's your wife?

86
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:01,445
Unfortunately. ..
Your wife is already...

87
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,055
I'm on your side. It's dangerous here.
Get to somewhere safe immediately.

88
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:12,123
Give me your gun ! I'm going to
gun down the guy who shot Erika!

89
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:19,369
Give me the gun right now!
He destroyed our happiness.

90
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,430
I'm going to...

91
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:23,534
Your wife.. .
wouldn't want you to do that.

92
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:31,051
Your wife wants that child to be safe.
Am I wrong?

93
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:51,130
I'll take you to a path through the
woods to the north, where you can escape.

94
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:57,375
You should go towards the path
instead of the hotel as well.

95
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:00,307
No. I won't go anywhere.

96
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:04,943
All right. I'll be right back.
Don't move from this spot.

97
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,780
Got it?!

98
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:23,935
It sure is quiet.

99
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:32,345
Say... They're really not after
the lottery prize we won, are they?

100
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,873
Yeah.

101
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:40,579
Honestly. I didn't feel like I was living
for the past few days.

102
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:43,154
There really was
something wrong with me.

103
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:48,424
Because of that money,
I ended up buying a bunch of guns.

104
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:51,160
Normal's what's best of all.

105
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:53,466
Normal, huh?

106
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:58,132
I've got to let my wife know
that we're not at fault.

107
00:11:59,306 --> 00:12:01,274
Hey, can you hear me, dear?

108
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:10,951
Mr. Henich!

109
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,486
Mr. Henich!

110
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,456
M-My wife...

111
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:25,491
Ma'am!

112
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:29,601
I-It hurts.

113
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:38,778
Quickly, this way!

114
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:42,244
They're shooting at us from
the building across the street.

115
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:43,744
Does this hotel
have a basement?

116
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:46,149
There's a storehouse
under the kitchen.

117
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:50,984
How are your injuries?

118
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:52,292
What about you?

119
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:55,160
Dad's doing this.

120
00:12:56,497 --> 00:13:00,400
Dad is going crazy because
he can't get a drink.

121
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:03,535
No he's not, Wim.

122
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:08,669
Dad's... Just like when he
hits me every day, Dad's...

123
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:12,506
Do you think that your dad is the sort
of person to do this sort of thing?

124
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,338
I...

125
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:18,175
This will end if I go out.

126
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,887
I...

127
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:26,821
Don't make me repeat it.
I won't let you die.

128
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:30,557
I'm going to tie you down here
if you keep saying that.

129
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:34,127
Stay here. I'll deal with it.

130
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:36,803
Mr. Grimmer...

131
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:38,872
I told you, didn't I?

132
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:42,931
When things get tough,
the Magnificent Steiner will appear.

133
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,046
Long ago...

134
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:48,878
I've seen cases like that
during my experiments.

135
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:54,577
By imposing an excessive amount
of stress from anger or sadness,

136
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:57,350
a child will manifest
a different personality.

137
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:02,323
Those children were
exceptionally violent.

138
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,428
Most of them
committed suicide.

139
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,698
I'm surprised you've lived
as long as you have.

140
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:20,344
Look. I'm unarmed.

141
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:23,546
Listen to what I have to say,
even for just a little while.

142
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:28,244
Why are you doing this?
Who gave you your orders?

143
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:31,957
It doesn't matter if you're people
from the old East Germany

144
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:33,493
or if you're former
secret police.

145
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:35,956
It doesn't matter who you are!

146
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:39,657
I'm nobody from nowhere.

147
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:42,261
Are you listening?

148
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,871
Listen to me. Don't just follow orders,
but think with your heart.

149
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:53,078
Think with your heart
about what you're doing.

150
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:55,749
Can you do that?

151
00:14:57,885 --> 00:14:58,477
You can...

152
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:00,781
What are you doing?

153
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,882
I was so scared!
I came all this way by myself.

154
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:09,094
I'm so glad that you're here.

155
00:15:10,497 --> 00:15:11,123
Huh?

156
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,278
<i>The Magnificent Steiner!</i>

157
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,917
<i>Hey everyone!</i>

158
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:35,046
I watched it so fervently each day,
sitting so close to the TV...

159
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:38,048
But I have no memory of
watching the last episode.

160
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,524
<i>Call out my name!</i>

161
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:44,089
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

162
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:45,255
<i>N-No.</i>

163
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:47,791
<i>No. No.</i>

164
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,468
<i>No!</i>

165
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:58,239
<i>I wonder if the main character,
the weak young man,</i>

166
00:15:58,312 --> 00:16:04,115
<i>realized that he turned into the
Magnificent Steiner when he got angry.</i>

167
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:10,754
<i>I wonder if that young man
found happiness.</i>

168
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:18,526
<i>That young man...</i>

169
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:26,537
<i>That young man
becomes happy.</i>

170
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:37,484
It's just a little further.

171
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:40,181
Just a little further and
we'll be out of the forest.

172
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,448
You're from Ruhenheim,
aren't you?

173
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:47,193
Who are you?

174
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:49,425
Something's happening
in the town, right?

175
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,092
People came into
the town with weapons.

176
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,329
Everyone in town began
killing each other.

177
00:16:56,837 --> 00:16:58,066
Are you with them?

178
00:16:58,472 --> 00:17:00,941
Calm down.
We're on your side.

179
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:05,767
Did you see an Asian man...
a Japanese man with long hair?

180
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,576
Do you know him?

181
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,140
So you do know him!

182
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:14,182
Y-Yeah. He was desperately trying
to help these children get away.

183
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:17,552
Right now, he's staying in
the town trying to save people.

184
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:21,087
When we split up,
he mentioned the Hotel Versteck.

185
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:23,096
Oh, Nina!

186
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,826
I left my car right outside
the path through the woods.

187
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,936
Use that car to transport
the injured and the sick.

188
00:17:30,504 --> 00:17:33,201
And contact the police
as soon as possible.

189
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,932
A-Are you planning on
going to the town?

190
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,472
You shouldn't do that.
You'll get killed!

191
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:42,442
Tenma's...
that Asian man is my friend.

192
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:46,651
I'm going to save him.
Contact the police immediately!

193
00:17:57,497 --> 00:17:58,760
Hotel Versteck...

194
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:31,488
Mr. Grimmer...

195
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:39,136
Hey. I knew you'd come,
Dr. Tenma.

196
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:45,878
Two in the neighboring building...
one on the floor below this one...

197
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:47,004
and one here.

198
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:49,807
I got a total of four of them.

199
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:53,980
The Magnificent Steiner appeared,
didn't he?

200
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:58,019
No. He didn't come.

201
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:05,289
I did it on my own.
I did it in a fit of anger.

202
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:08,732
Anyway, those wounds...

203
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:10,103
Oh yeah...

204
00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:12,233
So I don't forget...

205
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:17,907
Here. It's a letter.
I got it from Inspector Lunge.

206
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:21,478
He found it in
the Red Rose Mansion.

207
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,848
Help him. He headed to
the Hotel Bergbach by himself.

208
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:31,218
Before I do that, you...

209
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,592
I'm fine.

210
00:19:33,593 --> 00:19:36,358
Let me rest.. .for a while.

211
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:43,460
Let me introduce you.

212
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:46,438
This is. ..Franz Bonaparta.

213
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,634
Mr. Grimmer...

214
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:54,976
It's all right, Wim.

215
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:03,054
It's been raining a lot.

216
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:10,557
This area is nice when it's sunny. ..
don't you think, Dr. Tenma?

217
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:12,825
Yes.

218
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:18,530
When it gets sunny again,
let's have a picnic with Wim here.

219
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:20,799
Yeah.

220
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:25,511
We'll have good wine...
and good cheese.

221
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,006
Yeah.

222
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:35,488
I'm sad.

223
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,882
I'm not sad
because I'm going to die.

224
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:47,798
Right now,
I'm sad because my son died.

225
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:53,137
You can't make
people's feelings go away.

226
00:20:55,408 --> 00:21:01,006
My emotions were
lost somewhere.

227
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:10,581
It's as if I had received a letter that
had been sent to me decades ago.

228
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:18,091
So this is true sadness...

229
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:23,592
So this is happiness...

230
00:21:32,012 --> 00:21:36,040
The last episode of
The Magnificent Steiner...

231
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:44,623
He probably turned back
into a human.

232
00:21:56,937 --> 00:21:57,927
Mr. Grimmer?

233
00:21:59,272 --> 00:22:00,296
Mr. Grimmer?

234
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:02,799
Mr. Grimmer!

235
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:06,873
Mr. Grimmer!

236
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:18,881
I...

237
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:20,785
I...
