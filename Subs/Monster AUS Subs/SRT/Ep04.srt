1
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,989
How are you feeling, Mr. Junkers?

2
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:17,700
Mr. Junkers, do you recognize me?

3
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:20,102
Can you see this finger?

4
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,312
How about it? Can you answer me?

5
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:31,018
What's that...?

6
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:34,120
The monster...is coming...

7
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:36,822
What's that, Mr. Junkers?

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,823
The monster...is coming...

9
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:44,730
Coming...? What's coming?

10
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,533
The monster is coming...

11
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:54,433
The monster...is coming...

12
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:58,236
The monster?!

13
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:35,409
Junkers...

14
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,105
I know you're able to speak.

15
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:42,726
Of the four murders
of middle-aged couples

16
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,428
in the past two years,

17
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:48,480
you were seen near the scene
of three of them, you see.

18
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:52,318
How about it, Adolph Junkers?

19
00:02:57,965 --> 00:03:02,664
Never mind. We know that
you are a lock picker.

20
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,432
Your job is just to open locks.

21
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:13,190
Slitting throats
in a single stroke...

22
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:17,082
is not something you could do.
That means there were

23
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:19,882
other perpetrators
in addition to yourself.

24
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:24,556
I think that there would have to be
at least three people

25
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,252
in order to open a strong lock,

26
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:30,889
and murder a middle-aged couple
without resistance...

27
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:36,100
We're almost finished
making a list of men who use knives.

28
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:40,303
It's just a matter of time
before we pinpoint your colleagues.

29
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:43,702
Whether you talk, or not.

30
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:50,413
But that is not what
I really want to know.

31
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,216
Why four couples
from across Germany...?

32
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:59,725
And why only kill
middle-aged ones without children...?

33
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:02,420
Money and items were stolen,

34
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:07,162
but the amounts were too small
to split three ways to justify murder.

35
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:13,939
How about it?
Want to make a plea bargain?

36
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:17,772
If you make a statement,
you can escape prosecution...

37
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:23,143
Who asked you to do this?

38
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:35,997
Mr. Junkers. that's enough.
That's enough!

39
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:39,199
I'll have to ask you to
end this questioning!

40
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,667
No, just a little bit more.

41
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:43,504
Please leave this room!

42
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:45,066
That's an order from
his attending physician!

43
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:52,680
Oh, all right.
I'll come again another day.

44
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:56,409
But I will place a guard
to watch him closely

45
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:59,111
so that he isn't poisoned
or that he doesn't disappear.

46
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:04,058
Dr. Tenma, for some reason,

47
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:07,253
all kinds of trouble
seems to happen around you.

48
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:09,463
What are you trying to say?!

49
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:12,858
It's just a joke.
Excuse me.

50
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,042
Hey! You, where are you going?!

51
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:31,151
A walk.

52
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:33,581
Doing things without permission
is going to get me in trouble!

53
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:38,058
Even patients need recreation.
We're just going out into the garden.

54
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:40,494
If you're worried,
do you want to come with us?

55
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:56,308
It's a warm and pleasant day.

56
00:05:58,312 --> 00:05:59,871
You can talk, can't you?

57
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,747
On days like this,
it makes you glad you're alive...

58
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:09,746
I need days like this,
or else it becomes unbearable.

59
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:14,055
I see people in
life and death situations every day...

60
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:20,430
That's why it's easier for doctors to
focus on fame and research.

61
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:23,630
I used to be like that...

62
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:27,773
I tried to gain a reputation
and do my own research...

63
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:31,971
I thought that succeeding in surgery
was a way to fortify my status...

64
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:37,975
But after performing surgery
on a certain boy, I changed.

65
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:42,985
He was the elder of fraternal twins.
He'd been shot in the head.

66
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,256
Because I saved him, I was able to
return to being a real doctor...

67
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:52,091
The weight of people's lives
are all the same...

68
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,794
A doctor's work
is to save those lives...

69
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:01,942
Thank you.

70
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:10,918
You can start over.
It's not too late.

71
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,726
Doctor...

72
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:27,357
You and I are close in age,
but you're like my old man.

73
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:30,728
You saved my life...

74
00:07:31,772 --> 00:07:33,866
I feel like you're my parent...

75
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,144
I suddenly have a big kid, huh?

76
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:42,381
When I was little,
I wanted a mechanical clock...

77
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:43,750
Huh?!

78
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:45,183
You know...

79
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:50,656
The kind where a nutcracker doll
would stroll out on the hour...

80
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:52,803
Every day,

81
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:56,991
I would press my face against
the show window of the watch store...

82
00:07:58,532 --> 00:08:02,332
My first break in was that store...

83
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:08,240
They caught me right away
and I didn't get the clock...

84
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:13,636
But, after that,
break ins became my job...

85
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:18,151
At first, it was only because
I wanted that clock...

86
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:22,247
I only wanted the clock...

87
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:24,358
I...

88
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:31,328
Tell them everything...

89
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:36,460
Tell the police everything
and start over from scratch...

90
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,376
Killed...

91
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,180
My associates, all of them...
They were all killed...

92
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:48,348
Who killed them?!

93
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:53,351
The one you called "the monster"?

94
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:06,122
Make this one yours, now.

95
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:08,600
I went through a lot of trouble
to set this up.

96
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,434
She's the daughter of a member of
the state parliament, you know.

97
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:15,936
She is beautiful and intelligent.
She's really something...

98
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:19,039
I'll have to meet her first.

99
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,643
But...I guess...

100
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:23,746
I should do as you say
and settle down...

101
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:25,862
You should!

102
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:30,050
For someone with your prestige
to not have a wife... Huh?

103
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:31,558
Hey...!

104
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:41,965
<i>The kind where a nutcracker doll
would pop out every hour...</i>

105
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:44,171
This is it!

106
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:49,476
Excuse me!
About the clock in the window...

107
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:53,571
Hey! What's going on?!
It's already time for your date! Hey!

108
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:07,852
<i>You can start over.
It's not too late.</i>

109
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:26,112
Officer... Policeman on watch...
You're there, aren't you?

110
00:10:30,518 --> 00:10:31,781
I'll tell you everything.

111
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:34,216
But can you call Dr. Tenma, too?

112
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:38,782
Officer?

113
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:45,026
Officer?

114
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,891
It's late, but can I visit
one of the rooms?

115
00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:04,180
Yes, of course, Dr. Tenma.
What is that?

116
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:06,183
I found something good.

117
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:24,263
Hey! What's the matter?!

118
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:25,805
Get a hold of yourself...!

119
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:28,498
He's dead!

120
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:34,781
Candy...

121
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,117
Mr. Junkers!

122
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:53,823
Mr. Junkers!

123
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:02,270
<i>It's the same as the last time...!
Poisoned by candy!</i>

124
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,078
My patient's disappeared...!

125
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:06,842
It's the same thing that happened
nine years ago!

126
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:13,676
Mr. Junkers!

127
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,208
Mr. Junkers!

128
00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:39,972
It's me, Tenma!

129
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:42,315
Doctor...!

130
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:47,621
You mustn't come, Doctor!

131
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:52,025
Let's go back to the hospital,
Mr. Junkers.

132
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,417
Everything will be all right.

133
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:58,391
Don't, Doctor. You mustn't come!

134
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:05,038
You mustn't see him, Doctor!

135
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,174
"Him?"

136
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:10,771
He's the one
who killed my accomplices!

137
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:13,178
You'll be killed, too!

138
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:22,689
Wh-Who's there?!

139
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:26,284
Don't, Doctor! You mustn't come!

140
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:31,095
It's been a long time, Doctor.
It's me.

141
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:38,003
Nine years ago, you saved my life,
didn't you?

142
00:13:39,606 --> 00:13:40,698
Nine years ago?!

143
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:46,204
Have you already forgotten
about those twins?

144
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,708
Johan...!

145
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:58,825
Johan...!

146
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:10,667
That's right, those twins...
You remembered.

147
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:13,473
Run!
You'll be killed!

148
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:16,065
Wh-What do you intend to do?

149
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:18,375
Mr. Junkers is my patient!

150
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,246
What am I going to do?

151
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,351
Execute him.

152
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:33,403
Don't do it!

153
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:36,954
Doctor, run!
He killed my friends!

154
00:14:37,531 --> 00:14:38,508
Wha...?!

155
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:43,060
We were hired by him!
He always called us on the phone!

156
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:45,370
A large reward
was transferred into our account

157
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:46,873
after each job was done...

158
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,704
And we'd split it between the three of us!

159
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:50,910
Could it be...?

160
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:54,576
The one who ordered the murders
of the four middle-aged couples

161
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:55,672
was you?

162
00:14:58,252 --> 00:15:02,849
The police were watching me,
so we became a hindrance!

163
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:07,751
He's already killed Fritz, the Slayer,
and Big Boy Boris!

164
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:15,865
Just before he died, Fritz said,
"We've been hired by a monster."

165
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:20,635
He doesn't think anything of
killing people!

166
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:24,867
Run! Doctor, you'll be killed!
Run, Doctor!

167
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:27,679
You talk too much, Junkers...

168
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:29,282
Don't!

169
00:15:29,683 --> 00:15:30,878
Don't do it, Johan!

170
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:34,381
Mr. Junkers doesn't seem to know
who you are, but I do.

171
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:36,756
I was your attending physician!

172
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:42,260
You are Johan Liebert, the elder of twins.

173
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,508
You are the son of Michael Liebert,

174
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:49,765
former advisor of Commerce
in East Germany,

175
00:15:49,837 --> 00:15:51,862
who defected to West Germany
in 1936.

176
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,200
If we know this much about you,
you can't possibly escape!

177
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,776
Don't add to your crimes, Johan!

178
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:04,115
Johan...?
I used that name before...

179
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:09,654
But that is not my real name...

180
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,758
What do you mean?

181
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:14,961
My past must not be known...

182
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:19,161
Those four couples
and the Lieberts, too...

183
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:27,131
But you're different, Doctor...
You saved my life...

184
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:30,970
You're like my parent, after all...

185
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:33,175
Parent...me...?!

186
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:37,975
After all, if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be here.

187
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:41,984
Stop it!
You mustn't kill!

188
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,257
Why not?

189
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:49,390
"Why not?"
What do you think a human life is?!

190
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,992
Because I saved your life,

191
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:54,568
I was able to go back to being
what a doctor should be!

192
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:56,498
By saving your life,

193
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:59,903
I realized that
the weight of each life is equal.

194
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,942
No one has the right to
take another person's life!

195
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:08,008
I've lived for many years as a doctor
with that in mind.

196
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:15,917
What's so funny?!

197
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,027
Doctor, after that incident,

198
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:25,463
I heard you soon became
the Chief of Surgery...

199
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:32,763
I'm so glad that you were selected
as the Chief of Surgery.

200
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:34,972
What is it you want to say?

201
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:38,388
You're here now because

202
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:41,382
the Director, the Chief of Surgery
and the Chief died, right?

203
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,079
That's really good...

204
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:51,184
It can't be... You did it?

205
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:56,693
After all, you said it yourself...
This is what you wanted.

206
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:01,234
When I became conscious,
that's what you said

207
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:06,328
That you hated them so much
you could kill them.

208
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:09,138
<i>I am not wrong!</i>

209
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:12,241
<i>That bastard... That bastard...</i>

210
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,648
<i>He's better off dead.</i>

211
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:16,807
...off dead...off dead...

212
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:22,349
I did just as you wished, you know.

213
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:31,221
Doctor...I'm afraid, Doctor...

214
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:36,768
Doctor... Save me, Doctor...
I don't want to die!

215
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:38,835
Doctor!

216
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:07,029
I was supposed to have died back then.

217
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:11,327
You brought me back to life, Doctor.

218
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:51,540
Honestly, this rain is terrible.

219
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:58,784
I hate the rain. It washes away
all the evidence.

220
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:02,248
What about you, Dr. Tenma?

221
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:14,501
Let's see... That means,
from what you said...

222
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:21,107
In 1936, right after the Lieberts
defected from East Germany

223
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:26,408
with their twin children,
the Liebert family was shot

224
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:27,810
and the parents died.

225
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:29,225
The elder of the twins, the boy,

226
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:30,478
was hit in the head
and in serious condition.

227
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:35,688
You operated on the boy
and saved his life.

228
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:41,119
But, surprisingly, the boy,

229
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:46,042
killed the director, chief of surgery
and head of neurosurgery

230
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:47,397
with poisoned candy and ran away...

231
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:52,348
And last night, he appeared
after nine years

232
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:56,934
and killed a state police officer,
once again with poisoned candy...

233
00:20:57,277 --> 00:21:00,975
And shot Adolph Junkers
right in front of your eyes.

234
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:05,282
He is the one who hired
Junkers and two others

235
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:08,355
to kill the four middle-aged couples.

236
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:12,057
His name is Johan Liebert.

237
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:16,657
And that's all of it?

238
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:24,202
Hey.
-Yes?

239
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:26,900
Let him go for today.

240
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:35,725
Would you ever think that someone with
Dr. Tenma's credentials

241
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:38,377
would ever commit such a crime?

242
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:42,331
He has an alibi for the time
the policeman was killed,

243
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:44,915
and there was no gunpowder residue
on his hands.

244
00:21:45,926 --> 00:21:48,987
With this, the clue to solving
the murders

245
00:21:49,062 --> 00:21:51,724
of the four middle-aged couples
is gone.

246
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:55,733
For the time being, shall we
go after the guy, Johan Liebert?

247
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:57,103
Inspector Lunge...
