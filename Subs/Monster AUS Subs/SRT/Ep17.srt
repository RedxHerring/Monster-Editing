1
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:24,435
<i>The neo-Nazis are trying to
burn that town!</i>

2
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:29,513
<i>That Turkish woman was killed...</i>

3
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:36,484
We'll soon be arriving at the place
that Johan mentioned.

4
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:38,990
I don't know what will happen...

5
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:41,056
You can use a gun, can't you?

6
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:45,457
Take me to Frankfurt!

7
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,067
Calvin Street!

8
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:50,301
Weren't you going to kill Johan?

9
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:52,506
I'll do that later. Go quickly!

10
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:55,803
General Wolf will probably
be disappointed.

11
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,674
He asked you to kill Johan
because he thought that you could.

12
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:01,107
Asked me–?

13
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:03,877
I don't take orders from anyone.

14
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,451
I'm going to kill Johan
of my own accord!

15
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:08,756
Go to Calvin Street right now!

16
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:47,045
We've received confirmation that
the fires are ready to go at all points.

17
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:48,449
Good work!

18
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:52,985
Let's celebrate the superior people
with a wonderful fire!

19
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:54,020
Yes!

20
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:56,489
Now then...

21
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:58,195
What should we do with them?

22
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:01,767
There are people like them
even amongst the superior people...

23
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:05,204
One is a thief and the other is a kid

24
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:08,072
who was going to tell
the Turks our plans.

25
00:03:08,676 --> 00:03:09,871
They're both scum.

26
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:11,645
They're going to be purged...

27
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,307
I feel the same.

28
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,183
This place is going to
be burned anyway.

29
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:27,384
Here. Don't cry.
Mom's going to come back.

30
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:30,990
Ayse?!

31
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,226
Ay...

32
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:38,298
Y-You're still alive?

33
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:40,474
How did you find me?

34
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:43,908
Dieter told me where you live.

35
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:48,843
Dieter... So that "Tenma"
he was talking about was you...

36
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:51,785
Where's Dieter?
He came here, didn't he?

37
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:53,747
Huh? No...

38
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:55,081
He hasn't come?

39
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,657
Anyway, where's Ayse?

40
00:03:57,992 --> 00:03:59,756
This kid is Ayse's son.

41
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:02,229
I have to get him
to his mother quickly.

42
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:08,969
It can't be...

43
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,566
I don't believe it!

44
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:13,267
What is this kid going to do?!

45
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:16,175
He's so small, but has no mother!

46
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:18,039
What is he going to do–?

47
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:23,847
I don't want anymore victims.

48
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:27,853
Take me to the representatives
of this town!

49
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:38,357
What do you think?

50
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,094
Light the town on fire...huh?

51
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,295
We hear rumors about that sort of
extreme right-winger stuff

52
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:45,806
all year long.

53
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:48,040
We can't check out every single one.

54
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:50,242
First of all, it's suspicious that
this Japanese man

55
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:51,745
just waltzes into town,

56
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,747
even though he claims that
his life is in danger.

57
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:57,348
Ayse died because of this!

58
00:04:57,785 --> 00:05:00,755
She was killed
trying to tell everyone!

59
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:02,653
I wonder about that.

60
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:05,655
Ayse is a prostitute like you, isn't she?

61
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:08,953
Doing business with a German
in that area and disappearing...

62
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,628
It happens a lot.

63
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:12,989
You're a disgrace to the Turks...

64
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,802
Who knows whose kid that is...

65
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,406
You know how difficult it is
to make a living.

66
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,541
If you want to live,
listen to what I'm saying!

67
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:28,215
Forget it!

68
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,340
Do what you like!

69
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:31,276
You can all burn!

70
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,685
Well, hold on a second.

71
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,758
Are you asking us to
form an alert committee?

72
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:42,151
Let's do as this Japanese man says.

73
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:43,587
Mr. Deniz.

74
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:46,458
Are you going to listen to
this suspicious Japanese man?

75
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:48,568
He's definitely suspicious...

76
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,166
But there are trustworthy people
among the Japanese.

77
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,066
Like General Nogi.

78
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:58,238
General...Nogi?

79
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,810
You don't know him?

80
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,343
General Nogi was a Japanese man
who saved the Turkish Navy

81
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,184
when they were stranded
in the Pacific long ago.

82
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:09,449
Oh...

83
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:13,584
Gather all the men in town!

84
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:18,192
It looks so delicious...

85
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,497
Another special dinner today.

86
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:24,630
Wait, wait.
Don't be in a rush to eat...

87
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:28,702
Dinner will be finished
before showtime.

88
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,909
The show will climax when
the main dish comes.

89
00:06:34,248 --> 00:06:39,982
We will try this '76 Chateau Latour
I saved for tonight...

90
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:48,490
...and smack our lips over my favorite,
raw flounder with caviar.

91
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,428
And while we do that...

92
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:55,335
Ah...

93
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:56,870
Take a look.

94
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,566
The first fire has begun.

95
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:03,074
But that's still just an appetizer.

96
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:05,243
When is the main dish?

97
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:08,575
I told you, don't be impatient.

98
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:12,786
Take the time to savor your dinner
and enjoy the...

99
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:15,785
Where is the main dish?

100
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:18,521
If that fire is an appetizer...

101
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,819
What place are you going to burn
for the main dish?

102
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,764
- Over here!
- Water, water!

103
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:25,623
We don't have enough
fire extinguishers!

104
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:28,702
Don't go all at once!

105
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:30,535
Those who don't have their hands full,
come with me!

106
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,506
Just as I thought.
The flames started upwind!

107
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,101
That means that this area
is in danger, too!

108
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:37,401
Let's split up in three directions!

109
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:42,245
Oh my.
What a spectacular guest we have.

110
00:07:42,316 --> 00:07:43,340
- Why you...
- Don't move!

111
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:45,642
I'll really shoot.

112
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:48,351
Put away that dangerous thing...

113
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:51,124
Why don't we enjoy this together?

114
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,660
Unfortunately, your appetizer
is going out.

115
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:59,400
That was just the appetizer.

116
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:03,698
But this is your favorite, isn't it?

117
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:06,673
Too bad.

118
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:09,433
Let's enjoy this.

119
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:14,648
It's a celebration...to welcome
your brother, Johan.

120
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:17,341
Johan doesn't want this.

121
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:21,280
Oh? How do you know that?

122
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,156
I saw it.

123
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:26,117
I went to the place in his message.

124
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:27,153
Huh?

125
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:29,821
Johan didn't want this.

126
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,957
Wh-What did you see?!

127
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:35,395
He...

128
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,996
He didn't want anything!

129
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:41,670
A-All right.

130
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:44,439
Relax... Calm down.

131
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:46,071
You killed Ayse!

132
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,713
I won't let you do
any more cruel things!

133
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,476
Where is the main dish?!

134
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:52,953
Where are you planning to
set that town on fire?!

135
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,523
Damn! They started fires in places
that the fire trucks can't get to.

136
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:02,262
Bring the wounded!

137
00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:03,554
I'll go there immediately!

138
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:04,824
Tenma!

139
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,192
Did you find Dieter?!

140
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:09,065
There was someone
who said he saw

141
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:11,366
a kid who looked like him at the park
around noon, but...

142
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,807
Dieter...

143
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,283
Is it all right not to
go after that woman?

144
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:32,485
Yeah...

145
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:35,421
Let's continue dinner.

146
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:38,225
But that girl...

147
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:40,324
It's as I expected of Johan's sister.

148
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:41,327
Huh?

149
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,333
Her eyes earlier...

150
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,206
She really tried to kill me...

151
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:53,343
Because of that, I almost told her
the location of the main dish.

152
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:55,873
Then shall we continue dinner?

153
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:58,743
No, before that,
get me some underwear.

154
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,746
Huh?

155
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,822
What a terrifying girl.

156
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:29,842
Hold on!

157
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:31,084
I'm going to put it out right now!

158
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:38,721
You were very brave.

159
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:40,488
You're all right now!

160
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:44,896
I don't know who you are,
but thank you.

161
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:47,323
What happened to you?

162
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:49,069
Well...

163
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:51,330
Humph! It's that kid's fault!

164
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:53,805
Jeez. That was horrible.

165
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:56,704
Now then, I'm getting out of here.

166
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:02,347
They're not going to stop
with just fires!

167
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,209
Huh?

168
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:07,852
I lived here as I kid,
so I know this place well.

169
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:12,115
If I wanted to burn the town,
this place wouldn't do it.

170
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:16,222
I'm saying that this place is
a diversion!

171
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:24,328
Three locations upwind
were extinguished...

172
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:26,806
Mr. Tenma, we thank you.

173
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,175
Right everyone?

174
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,936
Yeah. Thanks to you,
it never became serious.

175
00:11:32,513 --> 00:11:34,379
Now we have to
tend to the wounded.

176
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:36,583
I won't have any more victims!

177
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:37,776
Never!

178
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,182
What do you mean by a diversion?

179
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:42,681
The winds change.

180
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:47,026
At this time of night,
the winds stop.

181
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:49,654
Then suddenly, a wind from the river
comes blowing.

182
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:59,333
The wind...stopped...

183
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:03,510
Now then...

184
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:07,540
It's about time for the main dish.

185
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:15,248
All right!

186
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:16,856
It's all right now.

187
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:18,855
Thank you, doctor.

188
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:20,516
Let's have a toast.

189
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:23,625
What are you talking about?
The wounded are to stay still!

190
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:26,667
Loosen up. Right?

191
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:31,834
That's right. It's thanks to you that
this town didn't have a huge fire.

192
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:34,436
The extreme right-wingers
are probably fretting

193
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:36,067
because there aren't any flames.

194
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:39,773
They've got to be!
Don't underestimate us Turks!

195
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:44,011
Are there any other shelters
with wounded people?

196
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:45,581
The mosque by the river.

197
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:50,567
Hey, Dr. Tenma, take a rest already.

198
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:51,683
Have a drink.

199
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:53,925
I have to tend to the wounded first!

200
00:12:55,996 --> 00:13:00,524
If the fires until now were diversions,
where are they going to light the fire?

201
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:04,901
Leave it alone. I don't care
what happens to this town!

202
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:09,433
Besides, I have a job I have to finish.

203
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,136
Wait!

204
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:12,035
Please tell me!

205
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:14,576
Where would you set the fire?!

206
00:13:14,715 --> 00:13:16,274
It's as I told you.

207
00:13:17,618 --> 00:13:19,780
The wind from the river
is going to blow soon.

208
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:22,387
There'd be nothing left of this town
if you set fire to

209
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:23,854
the abandoned factory by the river.

210
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:27,884
There should still be
some chemicals there.

211
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:34,733
It's almost time!

212
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,566
Time for the main dish.

213
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:40,966
Now, fill me up.

214
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:47,504
The plan is going as scheduled...

215
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:50,981
The celebration of
the superior people begins...

216
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:11,635
Why did you follow me?

217
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:13,495
I have to put out the fire.

218
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:15,409
I made a promise to Tenma!

219
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:18,178
Tenma?

220
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:29,256
This is it. The warehouse!

221
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:35,053
Thank goodness...I wonder
if they didn't notice this place...

222
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:37,386
Are these all chemicals?

223
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:41,992
There'd be nothing left of the town
if this many chemicals were lit.

224
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:47,162
All right. I'll protect this place!
I won't let them set fire here.

225
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,136
Are you all right?

226
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:51,669
I slipped...

227
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:54,210
What is this?!

228
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,443
It's gasoline...

229
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,092
Someone's...

230
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,286
...there...

231
00:15:09,496 --> 00:15:12,295
It's all right.
I can walk by myself...

232
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:15,292
At any rate, let's go to the shelter
and let me have a look at it.

233
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:20,534
Sorry. I sprained it when I was
carrying my precious furniture.

234
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:25,436
Now that I have this rug...

235
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:27,680
I have no business in this town.

236
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:28,948
It's an excellent rug.

237
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:32,281
It'll go for 800,000,
no, 1 ,000,000 marks.

238
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,179
Heckel!

239
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:39,793
What happened to Dieter?

240
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,227
Oh, well...umm...

241
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:44,529
I asked you what happened to Dieter!

242
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:45,765
Uhh...Yeah.

243
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,998
That kid went to
the abandoned factory by the river.

244
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,470
Factory?

245
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:52,863
The wind from the river is
going to be blowing soon...

246
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,299
This town is finished if the chemicals
in the warehouse are set on fire.

247
00:15:57,744 --> 00:15:58,370
Wha–?

248
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,050
It's this wind.

249
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:08,584
Tell everyone in the shelters
to get away from the riverside!

250
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:09,748
Quickly!

251
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:10,449
Huh?!

252
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,358
Let's go, Heckel!

253
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,185
Huh?!

254
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:17,889
Who is it?

255
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:21,165
Who's there?

256
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:39,352
Don't move!

257
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,354
Are you Johan's sister?

258
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,782
Throw away the lighter!

259
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,824
If I set the gasoline on fire

260
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:51,524
then this warehouse will be
a sea of flames in an instant.

261
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:53,931
I'm going to shoot you in the head
before you do that!

262
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:57,665
You'll stop moving
if your cranial nerves are severed.

263
00:16:58,238 --> 00:16:59,205
Will you hit?

264
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,268
I've taken half a year of training.

265
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:05,278
I have 100 percent accuracy
at this range.

266
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:07,110
Threats don't work.

267
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:10,476
This is a celebration of
the superior people

268
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:12,984
in order to welcome Johan!

269
00:17:13,587 --> 00:17:15,749
Johan doesn't want that!

270
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:20,117
Johan has indeed come to Frankfurt.

271
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:25,159
But he just killed one of your leaders
and his subordinates, then he left...

272
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,367
He left a message.

273
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,536
A message?

274
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,831
He's not the kind of person
you think he is...

275
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,166
He's...He's something
much more complicated...

276
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:37,906
What are you trying to say?

277
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:40,905
Something much more terrifying...

278
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:45,149
He's suffering in
the depths of sorrow!

279
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:53,323
I'm not responsible for becoming
enemies with these guys.

280
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,550
Which way is it to the warehouse?

281
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:57,019
Hey, that's good enough, isn't it?

282
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:00,425
I'm getting out of here.

283
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,001
What are you talking about?

284
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:05,336
Are you just going to abandon Dieter?!
Which way is it to the warehouse?!

285
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:08,767
A-All right!
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!

286
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:14,374
Your friend...you said his name
was Tenma, didn't you?

287
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:15,374
Huh?

288
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:18,480
I also have a friend named "Tenma".

289
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:21,750
Really? Is he also someone brave?

290
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:26,353
Yes... But I don't want him to
fire a gun.

291
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:29,252
I don't want him to kill anyone...

292
00:18:29,963 --> 00:18:32,295
You shouldn't kill anyone either!

293
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,467
No matter how bad a person is?

294
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:35,461
That's right!

295
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:37,500
Don't copy what I'm going to do!

296
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,007
Close your eyes!

297
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,175
Don't look!

298
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:45,211
Don't shoot!

299
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:50,309
Tenma!

300
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:03,863
Heckel, put out the fire!

301
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:06,357
The rug! Quickly!

302
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:12,171
Wait. You idiot!

303
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:27,985
M-My 1 ,000,000 marks...

304
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:30,549
Nina...

305
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:32,851
Tenma...

306
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:40,392
It's the police!

307
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:41,493
Run away!

308
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:43,527
Leave that man to me!

309
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:45,496
There's a boat by the river!

310
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:47,271
Quickly, run away, Tenma!

311
00:19:57,918 --> 00:20:00,751
My main dish...got cold...

312
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:10,026
Thank you for your cooperation.

313
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:12,462
Tell us the details at the station...

314
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,225
Wait a second!
I'll be right back!

315
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:17,793
Oh...H-Hey!

316
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,076
Tenma!

317
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,180
Nina!

318
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:36,580
Nina, make me a promise!

319
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:37,649
Don't shoot!

320
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:39,488
You shouldn't shoot people!

321
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,561
I saw Johan's message!

322
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,690
I also saw it!
I'm going there right now!

323
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:49,892
That time...ten years ago,
when I shot Johan...

324
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,573
I finally know what he meant when he
told me to shoot him in the head!

325
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,701
Johan...is not alone!

326
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:00,977
There are two Johans!

327
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:16,229
That's why...Dr. Tenma...

328
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:19,862
That's why...you aren't at fault...

329
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:32,173
I...I have to shoot Johan
in the head once more...

330
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:46,152
Hey, we don't need to
take a detour here.

331
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:47,724
Let's get going!

332
00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:51,157
Jeez. I give up...

333
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:53,829
I'm starving and broke.

334
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:58,298

Damn it.

335

337
00:22:19,993 --> 00:22:24,760
"Help me! The monster inside of me
is about to explode!"

338
00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:32,133
There are two personalities...
within Johan–?
