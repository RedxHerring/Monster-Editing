1
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:10,594
"When Zeus commanded"'

2
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:15,626
"the people who lived on the land
learned to plant seeds and till the soil."

3
00:00:15,937 --> 00:00:18,907
Karl, your pronunciation
is wrong again.

4
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:22,301
Sorry, I'm trying to be careful.

5
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:24,769
But you've gotten better.

6
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:31,575
When you first came here, I thought
that you were a terrible student.

7
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:33,287
Y-Yes.

8
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:35,679
What happened to him?

9
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:39,326
What happened to
that Japanese doctor?

10
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:43,958
I hear he's traveling
around the world.

11
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:45,924
I see.

12
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:52,365
I'd like to see him once more.

13
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:53,934
Yes.

14
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,339
You've started working?

15
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:41,909
That's good.

16
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,581
So what kind of work is it?

17
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:45,983
I'm an interior decorator.

18
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:51,855
I see ! You probably have
quite a good eye for furniture.

19
00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:56,353
It's interiors, but it's a little
different from that.

20
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,727
I'm a kitchen designer.

21
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,301
Oh?

22
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:06,570
It's funny, isn't it? I've never even
stood in a kitchen before.

23
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:10,672
Then could you do
my kitchen sometime?

24
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:11,871
Sure.

25
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:17,050
But your kitchens
must fetch quite a price.

26
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,285
Just a little.

27
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,285
You haven't been drinking,
have you?

28
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,351
No, not a single drop.

29
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:27,895
Good.

30
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:30,697
Let's take our time.

31
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:36,064
Even if we rush, the day will pass and
tomorrow will come in the same way.

32
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:40,832
That's what happiness is, right?

33
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:42,838
Are you tired of hearing that?

34
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,847
Happiness, huh?

35
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:54,388
He said he was happy just because
I was waiting for him at the station.

36
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:56,784
That man called Martin?

37
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,321
People are strange.

38
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,700
Their sadness slowly fades and
leaves only the fun memories.

39
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:14,765
People sure are
designed conveniently.

40
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:19,369
That's why we can
keep on living.

41
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,056
Let me introduce you.

42
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:31,720
This is Verdemann, the lawyer.

43
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:36,427
He's the person who cleared
your name, Mr. Grimmer...

44
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:41,629
I looked up as much
as I could about you.

45
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:45,066
You graduated from
511 Kinderheim.

46
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,865
You were a secret agent
for East Germany and

47
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:50,604
traveled around the world
posing as a freelance journalist.

48
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:54,072
Afterwards, you investigated
human rights violations

49
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:55,445
as a freelance journalist.

50
00:04:56,684 --> 00:05:00,951
The mountain of data in your big bag
was evidence of that.

51
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,223
But the only thing we never learned
was your real name.

52
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:11,996
Wolfgang Grimmer.

53
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:14,829
Not only his name...

54
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:18,672
He left without
telling us anything.

55
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:20,941
Inspector Lunge...

56
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:24,010
I'm no longer an inspector,
Detective Suk.

57
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,445
I heard that you became
a professor at a police academy.

58
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:33,647
I converse regularly
with my daughter now.

59
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:37,281
I say converse,
but it's by email.

60
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:42,129
We spent our lives as parent and child
without telling each other anything.

61
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:46,359
We both lived our lives not knowing
anything about each other.

62
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:57,639
How many things can
people say in a lifetime?

63
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,448
He probably had a lot he wanted
to talk about over a good beer.

64
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,756
You're going back
to Düsseldorf?

65
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,986
Yes. The company I'm under
contract with is over there.

66
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:17,364
I see.

67
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:22,628
Are you all right?
A lot happened to you there.

68
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:24,728
"It's pointless to run away."

69
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,634
"What's important is to
face the truth and move on."

70
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:30,370
Right?

71
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:31,738
Yes.

72
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:38,281
Could you dispose of this
when you have the chance?

73
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:41,981
See you later.

74
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,720
Okay. Take care.

75
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:48,126
Tell me if anything happens.

76
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:52,130
Dr. Gillen and
I will always help you.

77
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:55,596
Dieter and "him", too.

78
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:00,438
Give him my regards.

79
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:01,935
Okay.

80
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:16,080
"Questioning continues for Dr. Tenma.
The case in its entirety is still unclear."

81
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,752
"Inspector Lunge's
testimony begins."

82
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:26,627
"Could this possibly be the worst
serial murder case in European history?"

83
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:29,900
"Dr. Tenma
completely innocent."

84
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:34,233
"The police formally
apologize to Dr. Tenma."

85
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:38,275
"A motive for the case
still has not been found."

86
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:42,576
"Who is the mysterious young man
who is the supposed real criminal?"

87
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,196
"The University Münster's
medical department"

88
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,053
"invites Dr. Tenma to
become a professor."

89
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,987
"Dr. Tenma declines firmly."

90
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,724
"Dr. Tenma joins
Doctors Without Borders."

91
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,990
The articles get
smaller and smaller.

92
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:10,804
People are designed
conveniently, huh?

93
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,114
Hey, Dieter, you've gotten bigger
since the last time I saw you.

94
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:21,949
Mr. Heckel, it looks like you've
gotten sneakier since I last saw you.

95
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:24,820
You're still a chatty brat, huh?

96
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:29,026
Sorry, but I can't hang around.
I've got soccer practice.

97
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,722
Hey, wait a second.

98
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,760
Did Tenma come back?

99
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,696
Damn it.

100
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:39,263
He joined Doctors Without Borders,
or something.

101
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,041
He's trying to look good by doing
something that doesn't make any money!

102
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:43,608
I can't get a hold of him.

103
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,774
What are you going to do
if he is back?

104
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:49,244
With all the expenses
I incurred and

105
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:51,148
the labor I put into that job
he gave me a little while back,

106
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:53,050
I don't think he
compensated me enough.

107
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:55,552
Tenma gave you a job?

108
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,052
He said that he was
just looking for someone,

109
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:00,457
but it was a lot of work!

110
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:03,561
I even had to steal confidential
information from the police!

111
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:05,799
Who knows what'll happen
if they catch me...

112
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:11,738
Hey.

113
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,307
Give Tenma this bill!

114
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:17,934
If he can't pay it I'm going to make him
become an underground doctor again.

115
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:19,343
Tell him to be ready!

116
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:40,259
We've been waiting for you.
You haven't come for a while.

117
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:43,197
Well, I've been overseas.

118
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,308
Please, share this with everyone.

119
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:50,038
Oh, my, my...

120
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:43,195
The weather is nice.
Many leaves are photosynthesizing.

121
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:48,000
Life. .. Countless genes...

122
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,298
Do you know of Mendel?

123
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:54,370
Yes, he discovered
the rules of genes.

124
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:59,840
I went to the same university
as Mendel.

125
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:01,748
Bruno University.

126
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,746
It's in a city in Moravia, the Czech
Republic's southeastern region.

127
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,346
It's a nice place.

128
00:11:07,888 --> 00:11:09,253
I'll go there some time.

129
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,649
Thank you...

130
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:15,256
for coming by so many times.

131
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:18,891
I've enjoyed the times
we spent together.

132
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,726
It's nothing.

133
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,564
I'm in a good mood today.

134
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:27,603
I feel like I can
tell you anything.

135
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,112
No matter how terrifying...

136
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:47,657
You have something you
want to ask me, don't you?

137
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:58,004
You're...

138
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:04,470
the mother of the twins,
aren't you?

139
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:15,681
Yes.

140
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,562
I loved him.

141
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,691
That man killed him.

142
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:32,299
That was that
man's experiment.

143
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:40,271
I will never forgive that man.

144
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:54,020
Even if I die, these children growing
inside me will definitely punish him.

145
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:02,528
My hand...

146
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:09,068
Don't let go of my hand.
My hand...

147
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:21,787
Who is the real monster?

148
00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:29,154
Those children are still alive,
aren't they?

149
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:33,731
Yes. They're well.

150
00:13:55,823 --> 00:13:56,949
I just remembered.

151
00:13:58,158 --> 00:13:59,182
What is it?

152
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:02,894
I may never
remember it again.

153
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:05,763
I have to say it now.

154
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:10,693
I gave those children names.

155
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:15,339
Their names are...

156
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:31,191
Come in.

157
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:46,438
Tardy, as usual.

158
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:49,332
You're ten minutes late
for our appointment.

159
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:54,342
Sorry, Professor Kronecker...

160
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,850
Its fine. You know why
I called you in today, don't you?

161
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,192
It's about
your graduation thesis...

162
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:12,357
Come forward.

163
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:13,998
Y-Yes.

164
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:25,074
I know that a lot
has happened to you.

165
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,807
It must be pretty difficult to catch up
after your absence from school.

166
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:34,679
But that isn't an excuse
for my grades.

167
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:36,256
That's right.

168
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:42,057
Now about your thesis...

169
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:45,765
It's the best.

170
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:54,372
This is the best thesis I have
received from any of my students.

171
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,377
You did well.

172
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:02,972
I'm proud of you.

173
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:08,252
Th-Thank you very much.

174
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:10,652
What do you want to become?

175
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,649
Yes! A lawyer!

176
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,488
I pray that you will be able to
save many people.

177
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:21,892
You may go.

178
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:23,395
Yes!

179
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:29,702
But...

180
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:39,247
You won't be allowed to be late
for court, Fräulein Nina Fortner.

181
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:42,748
Yes!

182
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,884
Yes? Hello?

183
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:49,824
Oh, Dieter?

184
00:16:50,397 --> 00:16:53,662
<i>Well, are you graduating?
I'll be here with you even if you aren't.</i>

185
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:55,429
Oh, how reliable you are!

186
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:58,199
I'll have you cheer me up
the next time we meet.

187
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:00,831
<i>I can tell from your voice
that you're just acting.</i>

188
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:02,464
<i>You did it.
Congratulations!</i>

189
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:06,343
Thank you. Things will get
tougher from this point on.

190
00:17:06,914 --> 00:17:09,212
<i>Let's celebrate.
Come home quickly!</i>

191
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:11,883
I can't right now.

192
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:13,478
I have a part-time job.

193
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,787
I also have a lot planned
with my friends.

194
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:19,018
<i>What are you talking about?!
Tenma's coming back!</i>

195
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,557
<i>I just got a call.</i>

196
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:26,898
<i>But he's immediately
going back overseas</i>

197
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,628
<i>with Doctors Without Borders
afterwards.</i>

198
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:31,263
When's he coming?!

199
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:34,570
<i>He said he's coming back tomorrow.
So come back quickly Nina!</i>

200
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:42,839
Oh, Nina,
about our plans tomorrow...

201
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,680
Sorry. I can't go anymore!

202
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:48,655
<i>Tenma... I can see Tenma.</i>

203
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, hello.

204
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,467
Thank you for your efforts.

205
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,964
You've been
sleeping ever since...

206
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:37,170
Can you hear me?

207
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:42,639
I talked to your mother.

208
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,406
She loves you.

209
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:50,940
She told me your real name.

210
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:53,484
You had a name.

211
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:22,138
Dr. Tenma. .. There's something
I want only you to hear.

212
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:28,186
That time when the monster
appeared before me...

213
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:41,862
<i>Stop!</i>

214
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:44,233
<i>Don't touch these children!</i>

215
00:19:44,638 --> 00:19:45,730
<i>No!</i>

216
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:47,434
<i>Don't come near us!</i>

217
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:50,434
<i>This is an experiment.</i>

218
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:57,676
<i>One must be left behind,
one must be taken away.</i>

219
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,549
<i>This is an experiment.</i>

220
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,224
<i>Now, which one
will be taken away?</i>

221
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,125
<i>Don't let go.</i>

222
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:15,994
<i>Don't let go.</i>

223
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:19,797
<i>Don't let go.</i>

224
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:21,199
<i>Don't let go.</i>

225
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:23,910
<i>Mom...</i>

226
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:27,803
<i>Don't let go of my hand.</i>

227
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:35,088
<i>This one.</i>

228
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,849
<i>No...</i>

229
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:39,192
<i>This one!</i>

230
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:44,291
<i>No!</i>

231
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:51,166
Did Mother try to save me?

232
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:54,237
Or did she mistake me
for my sister?

233
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:56,835
Which is it?

234
00:20:57,944 --> 00:21:00,936
Which one of us
wasn't wanted?

235
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:33,072
I'll be going now.
