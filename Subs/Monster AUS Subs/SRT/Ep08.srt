1
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,765
<i>Dr. Tenma, it wasn't your fault.</i>

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,298
<i>You just did what you had to do
as a doctor... It wasn't your fault.</i>

3
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:25,178
<i>Please eat the sandwiches
and get some rest.</i>

4
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:33,086
<i>I want you to survive,
and save as many people as you can.</i>

5
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:35,420
<i>Nina Fortner.</i>

6
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,240
<i>Nina... What do you intend to do...?</i>

7
00:00:57,478 --> 00:01:00,641
<i>Do you intend to try to
kill him again...?!</i>

8
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:05,084
<i>I brought him back to life...</i>

9
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:09,391
<i>I brought that monster</i>

10
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:14,454
<i>back to life...</i>

11
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:55,339
This arteriovenous malformation

12
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:59,823
contains many blood vessels...
Cut away all of the inflowing arteries!

13
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:02,033
Treat all of the outflowing veins.

14
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,370
The removal of the nidus is complete.

15
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:18,479
Well...that certainly went well.

16
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,679
Yes. He did the clipping
very quickly, as usual.

17
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,049
That was a magnificent operation.

18
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:28,794
It was his first surgery after
an extended leave,

19
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,160
but the talent of this genius
keeps growing...

20
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:33,901
It's over...

21
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:35,402
Huh?!
-Huh?!

22
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,969
It's nothing...

23
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,781
<i>That was wonderful, Kenzo.</i>

24
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:28,382
That wasn't news about me,
but about your father.

25
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:29,952
That's true...

26
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,403
But that's because you did
such a perfect job last night,

27
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:38,058
as part of Father's team.
I'm sure Father is grateful to you.

28
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,896
After all, you're the one who has
raised the fame of the hospital.

29
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:44,264
I'm the one who is grateful.

30
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,101
It's thanks to your father that
I am able to work here in Germany.

31
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:51,310
Hang in there, Kenzo.

32
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:53,905
If you stick with Father,
your future is guaranteed.

33
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,817
It won't be long before Father
becomes Chairman of the hospital.

34
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:01,165
Then you'll quickly become
Chief of Surgery,

35
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:02,748
and in time, Hospital Director...

36
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:07,259
And then, I will be the Director's wife!

37
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:10,860
You must make me happy, now.
Hardships do not become me.

38
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,461
You want to go out on a date...?

39
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:15,335
Or...

40
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:53,196
I-I'm afraid you cannot...
The mistress is resting...

41
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,476
I won't take much of her time.
I will leave very shortly.

42
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:00,944
B-But, please return again
after making an appointment.

43
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:02,944
What's all that noise...?

44
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:08,054
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Ma'am.
It's the police...

45
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:09,646
Police...?

46
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:15,028
It's good to see you again,
Miss Eva Heinemann.

47
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:17,026
Who are you?

48
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:21,563
I thank you for the help you gave me
on your father's case, nine years ago.

49
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,261
I'm Lunge of the Federal Police.

50
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:27,873
Lunge... Oh...

51
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:30,044
You may leave us, Horst.

52
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:31,337
Yes, ma'am.

53
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,284
I remember you now.

54
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,553
You were just a useless detective
who couldn't even close that case.

55
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,255
What do you want with me now?

56
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,208
You've been able to
maintain this residence

57
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:54,964
even after your father's death.
I am impressed.

58
00:06:55,536 --> 00:07:00,133
No, I do believe all of the furnishing
is even grander than it was before.

59
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:03,839
Have you come to see how wealthy
I've become with

60
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:06,710
my inheritance from my father
and settlements from my divorces?

61
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,942
As you can see, I lack nothing.

62
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:16,052
If you see anything you want
please help yourself to it.

63
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:21,251
I'm fine, as long as I have my liquor.

64
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:25,131
Today...

65
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,069
I would like you to have a look at
something... This necktie...

66
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:31,972
Necktie?

67
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:33,572
Have you seen it before?

68
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,472
Perhaps you don't remember...
It's something from nine years ago.

69
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:43,894
It's a simple print,
but if you look at it carefully,

70
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,479
it's a wonderful piece
with a complex weave.

71
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,549
What about it?

72
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:55,053
This really gave me a hard time.
After all, it's been nine years...

73
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,595
But luckily, this comes from a shop
that had a limited number of these

74
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:04,832
made for their best customers.
And on their list...

75
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:06,901
I found your name...

76
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:10,303
As I said, what about it?

77
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:15,038
Didn't you purchase this
and give it to someone?

78
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,552
This plays a key role
in another murder, you see...

79
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:22,055
Murder...?

80
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:28,462
Who knows...?

81
00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:33,330
I've given countless gifts to men,
so I can't remember them all.

82
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:39,138
The men who approach me
are all after my money...

83
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:41,468
Please think carefully.

84
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,847
I said I don't remember!
They're all after my money!

85
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:50,373
There isn't a single person
who truly loves me...

86
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:54,680
That's why I took each one
to the cleaners with each divorce.

87
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:58,186
All three of them. Good for them!

88
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:03,327
Do you want something too?
You want something? Tell me!

89
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:05,994
Just remember it'll cost you!

90
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:09,826
I'll come again.

91
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:12,835
If you remember anything,
please give me a call.

92
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:16,843
Next time you come,
be sure to bring a bottle of liquor.

93
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:28,922
Excuse me.

94
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:09,896
Eva...

95
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:16,401
Eva, won't you talk to
your father for me?

96
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:18,462
I haven't done anything wrong!

97
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,307
I just operated
on an emergency case

98
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:22,876
in the order in which
he was brought in!

99
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:37,816
That's...your engagement ring.

100
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,484
You're such a fool.

101
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:42,028
Huh?

102
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:50,203
Eva!

103
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:52,633
Why, Dr. Norden,
don't you look elegant?

104
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,004
As do you! You're more beautiful
than ever tonight, Eva.

105
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:14,694
Horst, have my car readied!

106
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:24,972
Well, Mr. Hess, you seem to be
much better. Your color is good.

107
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:27,965
I think you'll be able to go home
sometime this week.

108
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:30,904
Thank you very much, Dr. Tenma.

109
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:34,278
My daughter is getting
married next month.

110
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:35,907
Will I be able to attend her wedding?

111
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,083
Yes, that should be fine.
Just don't overdo it at the reception.

112
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:43,423
Thank you.

113
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:47,688
I had resigned myself to not going,
but thanks to you, Dr. Tenma...

114
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:50,289
It was due to your own efforts.

115
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:53,343
With you at my side,
I feel as though I can be there,

116
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:57,099
not only at my daughter's,
but at my grandchildren's weddings, too.

117
00:11:58,272 --> 00:12:03,142
You are truly an excellent doctor.
Please stay here at this hospital.

118
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,050
Uh, Dr. Tenma... You have a visitor.

119
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:13,676
I must make my rounds now.
I'm too busy. Please turn them away.

120
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:15,079
B-But...

121
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:25,298
Eva...

122
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:37,809
It's been a while, Kenzo...

123
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:39,980
Yeah...

124
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:45,779
We've gone through so much,
haven't we?

125
00:12:49,356 --> 00:12:51,415
Father... Are you asleep?

126
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:55,895
I'm coming in.

127
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:10,073
Father...!

128
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,278
Eva...
-Eva...

129
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:19,877
I know it's hard, but you must
pull yourself together...

130
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:20,954
Let go of me!

131
00:13:21,522 --> 00:13:25,288
Give me back my father!
Father...!

132
00:13:29,897 --> 00:13:30,864
Kenzo!

133
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:34,264
Please, I was wrong.

134
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:37,404
Kenzo...

135
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,299
<i>Kenzo...!</i>

136
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,515
You've lost some weight, haven't you?

137
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:52,385
Not really...

138
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:54,819
I hear you were on extended leave.

139
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:58,984
Yes, you should rest yourself
from time to time.

140
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,255
You're such a glutton for work...

141
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:05,327
You've lost some weight too,
haven't you?

142
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:08,831
So much has happened...

143
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,569
You've heard the rumors,
haven't you?

144
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:14,240
Yeah...

145
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:27,053
Spring... Do you remember?
Ten years ago, in spring...

146
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,783
We often went driving together...

147
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:31,886
We were so young.

148
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:35,960
You tried to swim in the river
in that season...

149
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:38,599
I hurriedly stopped you...

150
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:41,702
And then you...

151
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:42,769
I'm sorry, but...

152
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:44,003
Huh?

153
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,509
Eva, I haven't got time...

154
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:52,011
Kenzo...?

155
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:55,506
I want us to start over!

156
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:02,115
After three failed marriages,
I finally realized...

157
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:07,559
the only one who truly loved me
was you, Kenzo.

158
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:11,664
I'm sorry.

159
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,967
Kenzo!

160
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:20,867
Please, Kenzo!

161
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,078
I appreciate your feelings,
but I just can't accept them...

162
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:31,742
Good-bye.
-Wait, Kenzo! I didn't say a word!

163
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:34,352
When the police came
to ask about your necktie!

164
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:40,392
Isn't there something bad
connected with that necktie of yours?

165
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:44,564
I'm sure that's the tie that I gave you.

166
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:48,693
If you do as I say,
I'll keep quiet about it!

167
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:54,206
I have something I must do.

168
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:17,323
In that case, I'll tell them everything!

169
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:20,057
I'll tell the police about that necktie!

170
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:21,968
I'll tell them everything!

171
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:25,035
The person who killed my father
nine years ago...

172
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:26,971
I'll tell them you did it!

173
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:40,085
I see... Bring Dr. Tenma in
as a person of interest.

174
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:43,183
B-But there isn't enough evidence

175
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,759
in the Fortner couple
and Maurer murders.

176
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:50,285
I'm talking about
the killing at Heidelberg Castle.

177
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:51,664
Y-Yes, sir!
-Y-Yes, sir!

178
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:56,067
Thank you for your cooperation.

179
00:16:57,037 --> 00:17:00,598
This might allow us
to solve a lot of murders.

180
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:06,312
Resignation...?

181
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:09,349
What is the meaning of this,
Dr. Tenma?

182
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,049
I'm sorry if I'm acting selfishly, sir...

183
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:17,767
There seem to be various
strange rumors about you, recently,

184
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:22,661
but I don't believe any of them.
Please think this over...

185
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:25,260
Oh... T-Tenma...!?

186
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,867
Dr. Tenma!

187
00:17:33,206 --> 00:17:37,473
Yes! I'm me... What?! The police?!

188
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:41,180
Huh?

189
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,778
Dr. Tenma is a murder suspect?!

190
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:04,530
Close off the exits from each wing!

191
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:06,333
Don't forget the back exits!

192
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:07,540
Yes, sir!

193
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:11,208
Where is Dr. Tenma?!

194
00:18:11,278 --> 00:18:12,507
L-I don't know!

195
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,019
What's going on there?
Hurry up and search the place!

196
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:26,560
Oh, but inspector...

197
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,534
What is it?

198
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:37,562
Get out of the way!
You're interfering with the police!

199
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:41,932
Dr. Tenma would never kill anyone!
-That's right!

200
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:44,737
We're indebted to him
for saving our lives!

201
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:46,575
Dr. Tenma is innocent!

202
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,738
Go away, police!

203
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:49,692
That's right, go away!

204
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:55,052
Go away!
-Go away!

205
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,730
Something seems to be going on.

206
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,637
There's a whole bunch
of patrol cars, Dr. Tenma.

207
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,935
L-I see... I wonder what's going on...

208
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,406
Anyway, just drop me off
in front of the station.

209
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:19,640
Yes, sir. You're busy as always,
aren't you, Dr. Tenma...?

210
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:37,756
<i>I.. .I have a surgery waiting for me.</i>

211
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:39,763
<i>Wait! Dr. Tenma!</i>

212
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:41,459
<i>Dr. Tenma!</i>

213
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:47,731
<i>Don't worry Hang in there!</i>

214
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:50,272
<i>I'll save you...</i>

215
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:53,971
<i>I am not wrong!</i>

216
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:56,649
<i>You say there's
a flaw in my character?</i>

217
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:57,941
<i>What about you?!</i>

218
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:00,585
<i>You call yourself a doctor,
but you're just money hungry!</i>

219
00:20:00,987 --> 00:20:03,183
<i>That bastard... That bastard...</i>

220
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:05,687
<i>He's better off dead...</i>

221
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:09,994
<i>Oh, no! The twins are
nowhere to be found!</i>

222
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,168
<i>W-What is this...?</i>

223
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:19,096
<i>What in the world happened...?</i>

224
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,108
<i>Long time no see, Doctor. It's me.</i>

225
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:30,105
<i>Have you already forgotten
about those twins...?</i>

226
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:33,786
<i>Johan!</i>

227
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:39,517
<i>Save me, Doctor... I don't want to die!</i>

228
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:41,619
<i>Doctor!</i>

229
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:59,037
<i>I was supposed to have died that day</i>

230
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,982
<i>You brought me back to life.</i>

231
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:02,542
It looks like another scorcher today.

232
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,769
Hey, it's summer,
yet you're all bundled up.

233
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:07,142
Aren't you hot?

234
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:11,380
What's that?
That paper's three days old.

235
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:15,589
They say this time a middle-aged couple
in Verden was killed.

236
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:18,081
I hear the killer is a doctor.

237
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:22,661
Oh, yeah... You said you're going
to Verden, didn't you?

238
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:24,395
You know someone there?

239
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:28,862
Yeah... I don't know if
I can meet up with him or not, but...

240
00:22:29,703 --> 00:22:31,193
I have to go there...
