1
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:11,960
<i>There are five dead and
thirty-four injured in the fire</i>

2
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:15,628
<i>at the University of Munich's Friedrich
Emmanuel Campus Library.</i>

3
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:19,866
<i>A grueling search for the missing
is now underway</i>

4
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:23,243
<i>We've interviewed some of those
who have been rescued.</i>

5
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:24,278
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

6
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:28,808
<i>I-I just suddenly found myself
in a sea of fire...</i>

7
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:31,844
<i>I couldn't breathe
because of the smoke.</i>

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,383
<i>I thought it was all over.</i>

9
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,655
<i>Someone saved us!</i>

10
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:37,414
<i>Yes. It was an Asian man.</i>

11
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:42,657
<i>Is he all right? He shot the hinges
off the door to get it open.</i>

12
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,700
<i>If he hadn't been here'
a lot of people would have died.</i>

13
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:54,604
<i>The police have confirmed
that the fire was arson'</i>

14
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:57,008
<i>started with kerosene
and gasoline.</i>

15
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:01,948
<i>And have promised do their best to
find the arsonist as swiftly as possible.</i>

16
00:02:37,578 --> 00:02:39,672
It's completely burned.

17
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:42,708
"Humanity's wisdom"
or "treasures" they may be,

18
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:45,344
but once books have been burnt,
they're gone for good.

19
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:49,551
Did you find any fingerprints
on the sniper rife we found?

20
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:53,219
It survived the fire, but I don't know
if we'll get any fingerprints from it.

21
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:56,889
It's definitely a Mauser SR 93,
the same type of rifle that was

22
00:02:56,964 --> 00:03:01,197
purchased by a Japanese man,
whom we believe to be Tenma.

23
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:05,695
It'll be difficult to find any evidence
of the perpetrator on it

24
00:03:05,773 --> 00:03:07,207
when it's burnt like this.

25
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:09,641
There's no such thing as
a crime scene without any evidence.

26
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:11,037
Huh?

27
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,548
Here's a cuff link.
Send it to the lab.

28
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,883
Okay.

29
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:18,845
There was someone here.

30
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:24,022
No one can be anywhere
without leaving a trace.

31
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:28,487
If there was such a person,
he's not human.

32
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:32,857
Then in the event that
there wasn't any trace of him,

33
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,197
what would that make him?

34
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:35,936
A demon.

35
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:43,742
No such thing exists, so there
isn't a culprit we can't arrest!

36
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:47,809
Can I see Schuwald?

37
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:50,948
Oh... He's in
the intensive care unit.

38
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,186
His burns aren't that severe,

39
00:03:54,288 --> 00:03:58,088
but because of his age,
the doctors won't allow him any visitors.

40
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:58,852
We're going there.

41
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,686
Huh?!

42
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:03,125
You're being very troublesome, sir!

43
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:04,828
I cannot permit you to see him!

44
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:08,960
He's conscious, isn't he?
I'll leave after a few minutes.

45
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:12,529
Mr. Schuwald is suffering
from severe shock.

46
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:14,632
He needs absolute quiet.

47
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:16,410
Who's he?

48
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:19,646
That's Mr. Schuwald's son.

49
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:24,150
I'm sorry that such a terrible thing
has happened to your father.

50
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:28,745
I'm Lunge of the BKA.

51
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:32,086
Umm... I've already asked
the police, but...

52
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:33,890
There's someone I want to find.

53
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:40,627
Who's that?

54
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:45,067
The person who tried to
assassinate your father.

55
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:49,040
You really don't know him?

56
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,409
I don't know this man.
But it might be him.

57
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:53,873
Him?

58
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:56,406
That's right.
That's what I wanted to say!

59
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:59,377
Please find Johan Liebert!

60
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:02,754
Johan...Liebert...

61
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:07,653
Johan attended the ceremony
at the library with my father.

62
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:10,559
But I've searched everywhere,
and I can't find him!

63
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,800
<i>Johan...</i>

64
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:14,895
<i>Johan Liebert...</i>

65
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:21,241
All right.
I'll order a search immediately.

66
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:26,877
This is the room
that Johan Liebert rented.

67
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:33,588
He moved out two weeks ago.

68
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:56,600
His name wasn't in
the Law Department register.

69
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:58,378
He's a fake student.

70
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,448
Did you contact his parents
in Offenbach?

71
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:05,545
Well, that was also a dead end.

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,287
Apparently, they didn't associate
much with their neighbors.

73
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,889
At the very least, shall we
collect fingerprints from this room?

74
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:14,293
We probably won't get anything.

75
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:14,988
Huh?

76
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,433
No data to input.

77
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:28,374
This the first time I've seen a room
so devoid of human evidence.

78
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,936
Okay.

79
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,874
<i>I am Johan.</i>

80
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:35,947
<i>I am Johan Liebert.</i>

81
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:40,552
<i>Who am I?
I was here.</i>

82
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,580
<i>But I don't exist.</i>

83
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:54,160
<i>Is he a demon?</i>

84
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:06,704
Thank goodness, Nina.
You only have light injuries.

85
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:09,715
Sorry for worrying you, Lotte.

86
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:15,345
That's right. I was really worried!
They were rescuing people.

87
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,283
But I didn't see you.

88
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:18,987
I was worried about
what happened to you.

89
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:25,259
But it's amazing you got out of
that fire with just these wounds.

90
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,523
The firefighter was also surprised.

91
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:31,071
That's because I was saved.

92
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:36,700
You were saved? You were
the last person to come out of there.

93
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:38,679
A Japanese man.

94
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:43,348
Do you know whether
a Japanese doctor

95
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,976
was among the survivors
at any of the hospitals?

96
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:49,653
There were several Japanese people
but they were all businessmen.

97
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,016
That's impossible.

98
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,286
Huh?!

99
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:58,192
When I was trapped
under that curtain, he...

100
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:07,734
<i>Nina!</i>

101
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:09,535
<i>Nina!</i>

102
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:11,304
<i>Nina!</i>

103
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:20,748
He was definitely there.

104
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,558
Right before the fire started,

105
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:31,326
you told everyone attending
the ceremony to get out.

106
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:34,963
Why did you do that?

107
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,133
You sensed something beforehand.
Am I right, Mr. Schuwald?

108
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:43,835
Umm...
You should leave it at that.

109
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:46,742
Also, do you know this man?

110
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,074
Can you see it if I put it
this close to your face?

111
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,250
This is the man who
tried to assassinate you.

112
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,490
There are witnesses who
saw him at the library.

113
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:06,697
But according to the witnesses,
this man was trying to save people.

114
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:11,895
That's enough, isn't it?
Please stop this.

115
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:16,577
Please contact me if you
remember something.

116
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:23,307
One more thing.

117
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:28,555
Do you know where your secretary,
Johan Liebert, went?

118
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:48,237
Please leave already!

119
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:52,208
It seems he's gone
completely senile.

120
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:55,709
Well, it can't be helped,
when you see something that terrifying.

121
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:57,376
And at his age...

122
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:03,054
This is the end of the Vampire of Bavaria,
the emperor of the business world.

123
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:04,517
No.

124
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:05,384
Huh?

125
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,586
Those were the eyes of a man
who understood everything.

126
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:09,922
Okay.

127
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:13,997
Let's question other witnesses.
Do you have a list of the victims?

128
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:15,569
Oh, yes.

129
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:19,033
But what does this mean?

130
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:23,805
We have testimonies that the person we
believe to be Tenma was saving people.

131
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:27,340
Could this also be
multiple personality disorder?

132
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:32,878
Nina...

133
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:35,752
Nina Fortner.

134
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,921
What about her?

135
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:52,269
If you're looking
for Nina Fortner,

136
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:54,103
she checked out of
the hospital this morning.

137
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:58,102
Her address in
the police register is fictitious.

138
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:00,037
What does
the hospital register say?

139
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:02,438
Oh, yes. I'll look it up.

140
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:04,778
<i>Nina Fortner...</i>

141
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:07,486
<i>That's the name of the daughter
of the Fortner couple</i>

142
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:09,249
<i>that was killed in Heidelberg...</i>

143
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:11,623
<i>Her whereabouts are unknown.</i>

144
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:16,963
Thank you for telling me about
such a painful experience.

145
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:23,835
It completely matches Tenma's story
of the past ten years.

146
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:25,164
Tenma?!

147
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:29,501
That's right. He followed a string
of events that led him here.

148
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:34,277
And he immediately
left to kill Johan.

149
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:39,882
That day,
I went to the library because

150
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:44,618
I thought that Tenma was going to
carry out his assassination plot.

151
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:46,919
But there was that fire.

152
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:52,727
I don't even know if Tenma was there,
let alone Johan.

153
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:56,269
Listen, Nina.

154
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,440
Forget about chasing Johan already.
He's not someone you can handle.

155
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:05,610
Sure, the police
aren't very helpful,

156
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,740
but we should sit back and
take our time to fight this.

157
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:11,447
The truth will be
revealed in time.

158
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,651
It's all right. We're with you.

159
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,056
You must be tired.
Stay here for a while.

160
00:12:20,794 --> 00:12:22,057
He was there.

161
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:23,322
Huh?

162
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:27,363
He was there in the library.

163
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:30,898
Tenma was there.

164
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:47,882
You've got to eat something.

165
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,784
Thank you, Dieter.

166
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,494
The bread is a kaisersemmel.

167
00:12:56,363 --> 00:12:58,695
It has roasted ham and
gouda cheese in it.

168
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,135
It's Tenma's favorite.

169
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:04,371
Thank you.

170
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,174
It's delicious.

171
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:09,235
Really?

172
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:12,608
Yes. I feel energized whenever
I eat something delicious.

173
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:16,413
Tenma always
used to say that, too.

174
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,357
I want to see him.

175
00:13:28,195 --> 00:13:29,526
I want to see Tenma.

176
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:33,092
Yeah.

177
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:41,907
We're going to enter
a good season soon.

178
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:43,202
Oh yeah.

179
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:45,907
When you get better,
why don't we take a trip?

180
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,211
How about Asia?

181
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,577
I think it would be a good
change of atmosphere.

182
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,946
Rest a bit longer.

183
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:58,958
Dad, you've been through
more than enough.

184
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:05,498
Bridge.

185
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:06,659
Huh?

186
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:09,200
Three...

187
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,662
What is it?
What are you trying to say?

188
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:16,171
Three...frogs...

189
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:17,403
Huh?

190
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:18,940
His eyes...

191
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:19,939
Eyes?

192
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:24,483
Hell was reflected in his eyes...

193
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:30,684
There was hell reflected in
a living person's eyes...

194
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:34,294
Karl.

195
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:35,321
Yes?

196
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:39,328
There's something I want you
to tell a certain man.

197
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:40,893
Y-Yes.

198
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:45,096
There's a man
waiting in Dresden.

199
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,738
Dresden?
What should I tell him?

200
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:52,438
Okay.

201
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:56,911
Y-You want me to tell that to
that man in Dresden, right?

202
00:14:57,518 --> 00:14:59,179
Sh-Should I go immediately?

203
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,915
All right.
I'll go immediately.

204
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:09,429
Karl...

205
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:15,159
Your mother... Your mother
hated me, didn't she?

206
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:19,607
No. She didn't hate you.

207
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:23,109
Karl...

208
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:29,482
Will you stay with me always
when you return from Dresden?

209
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,446
Yes.

210
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:38,384
I'm afraid.

211
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:40,890
Afraid? Of what?

212
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:45,229
I don't really know.
But I'm very afraid.

213
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:48,660
Remember what it is.
There's no need to get anxious.

214
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:50,136
Slowly...

215
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:52,696
A village straight
out of a fairytale...

216
00:15:53,373 --> 00:15:54,340
A village out of fairytale?

217
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,206
Where was it?

218
00:15:57,845 --> 00:16:00,507
That thing you felt when
you saw this picture book...

219
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:04,378
Tell me anything that
pops into your head.

220
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:16,953
Dr. Gillen...

221
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:18,389
No, just a little more.

222
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
Please stop!

223
00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:22,569
Three...

224
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:27,403
Three frogs...

225
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:29,375
Three...

226
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:30,710
Frogs?

227
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:32,539
What are you talking about?

228
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:34,707
A picture...

229
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:40,084
Is that picture in the picture book
that made Johan faint?

230
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:44,387
There weren't any frogs
in that picture book.

231
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:46,054
Where did you see them?

232
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:52,932
That's enough.

233
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:54,923
Let's leave it at that for today.

234
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:56,996
Okay.

235
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:18,918
It was a mistake to trust
that BKA detective Lunge.

236
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:23,788
Yes. I think we should
change our plan.

237
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:26,700
From now on, whenever we
bring evidence to the police,

238
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,792
we must negotiate directly
with the upper divisions.

239
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:34,368
We've also got to take time to hit them
with absolutely corroborative data.

240
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:38,577
Take time? How much time?

241
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:42,905
Right now, our information on Johan
is vague and unimpressive.

242
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:46,182
Johan was Schuwald's secretary.

243
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,955
Schuwald might have
some information.

244
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,784
But he won't see
anyone right now.

245
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:53,283
What about his son Karl?

246
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:56,892
Well, he went somewhere
two days ago.

247
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:58,495
I haven't been able
to contact him.

248
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:07,172
It's not certain, but some witnesses say
that an Asian man was saving people.

249
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:14,113
But if Tenma's fingerprints are on
the sniper rifle found at the scene...

250
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:17,043
those testimonies mean nothing.

251
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:18,985
How long do we have to wait?

252
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,045
We don't have time!

253
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:24,353
By the time the truth is revealed
and the police move...

254
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:28,784
By that time,
Tenma will already be...

255
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:32,558
Nina...

256
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:36,336
S-Sorry.

257
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,398
Nina, I understand how you feel.

258
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:44,074
As I told you earlier,
I lost my dear friend Richard to this case.

259
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:46,872
He had a bright future.

260
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,375
But Johan cut his future short!

261
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:53,678
I'm not retreating! Never!

262
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:58,817
Now, let's eat.

263
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:08,960
Three frogs...

264
00:19:11,638 --> 00:19:14,630
A village straight
out of a fairytale...

265
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:27,376
I got it.

266
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:51,911
Dieter...

267
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:55,481
I'm going, too.

268
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:01,454
What are you saying?
You can't!

269
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:08,189
You stay here, got it?
Tell Dr. Reichwein I said thank you.

270
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:09,688
See you later.

271
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:16,362
Dieter!

272
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:18,504
I want to see him.

273
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:22,606
I want to see Tenma!

274
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:50,429
The third day also
wasn't any good.

275
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:54,130
He told me to wait at the public square
in front of the station,

276
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,572
but this place is just too big.

277
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:04,508
Dad, it doesn't look like
I'll meet the man you talked about.

278
00:21:13,894 --> 00:21:14,520
Karl...

279
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:19,358
You're Karl, aren't you?

280
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,634
Y-You're...

281
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:25,401
The man who was planning
to assassinate your father...

282
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:28,232
Is that what the police said?

283
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:29,971
Y-Yes.

284
00:21:30,544 --> 00:21:33,309
I've been watching you from
a building for three days.

285
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:36,306
The police don't seem
to be following you.

286
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,680
Can you tell me the message?

287
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:45,049
<i>Get a hold of yourself!
We're almost out of here.</i>

288
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:49,390
<i>Get out of here quickly!
The police are coming.</i>

289
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:50,858
<i>B-But...</i>

290
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:54,694
<i>Dresden... Wait at the public square
in front of the station.</i>

291
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:58,137
<i>My son Karl
will have message.</i>

292
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:05,778
Give me the message, quickly.

293
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:08,540
Here...

294
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:13,579
edok Bridge... Three frogs?

295
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,988
And my father also said,

296
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:19,890
"If the monster you're
chasing is a twin..."

297
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:26,197
<i>The mother of the twins
is still alive in Prague.</i>
