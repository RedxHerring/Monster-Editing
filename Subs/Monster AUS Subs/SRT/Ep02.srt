1
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,072
Blood pressure, 120 over 30;
pulse, 92.

2
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:25,370
I will now remove the bullet.

3
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:37,814
I have removed the bullet.

4
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:42,523
The removal is complete.

5
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:47,101
It's a little early to be relieved;

6
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:49,603
we must still reinforce the walls
of the damaged blood vessel.

7
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:51,335
Huh? Uh-huh...

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,130
Get the proline ready.

9
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:54,341
Yes, sir.

10
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:39,903
Blood pressure, 123 over 72;
pulse, 33.

11
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:43,017
Seems the anesthesia is still working.

12
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,886
Do your best...

13
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,196
Do your best to survive...

14
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,667
Oh...Dr. Boyer...

15
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,973
Looks like yours went well.

16
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,239
Yes. The surgery did...

17
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,335
The mayor died.

18
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:18,177
L-Is that so...?
That's a shame...

19
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:21,881
Humph! You act as though
it's none of your concern.

20
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:23,300
Huh?!

21
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:26,103
You're the very one
who abandoned our team

22
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:27,652
just before surgery.

23
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:31,208
Oh...but, that child
was brought in before the mayor...

24
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:33,291
What does it matter, who was first?

25
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:36,413
The problem is, because you selfishly
pulled out of our team,

26
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:39,668
we were forced to try to fill
the vacuum you created!

27
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:42,102
B-But... Listen to me! I...

28
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,201
You upset the teamwork.

29
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:47,708
By order of the Director,

30
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:50,115
I instructed you
to perform the surgery...

31
00:03:50,218 --> 00:03:51,379
on the mayor.

32
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:54,784
But you... You ignored me!

33
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:57,234
B-but, Chief, at that time...

34
00:03:57,258 --> 00:04:00,319
The success of a surgery
depends upon trust

35
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:02,226
among the entire staff.

36
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:04,759
But you made a grand stand play!

37
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,768
I have already reported this
to the Director.

38
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,882
He greatly regrets this incident,

39
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:14,534
which has lowered
the prestige of this hospital.

40
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:16,572
Prepare yourself!

41
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:22,783
Uh, sir...

42
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:24,184
Please wait a minute!!

43
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:29,246
Dr. Tenma...

44
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:35,088
At present, that child's blood pressure
is 114 over 32; pulse, 34.

45
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:38,262
His vitals are very stable.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,867
I see...
That's good...

47
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:45,771
Um... That operation...
It was wonderful.

48
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,475
<i>Mayor Roddecker, who collapsed
while on holiday.</i>

49
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:59,714
<i>Has passed away at the hospital.</i>

50
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:02,316
<i>Upon hearing this unexpected news,</i>

51
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,017
<i>people have been arriving
at the Mayor's office</i>

52
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:06,059
<i>with bouquets of flowers,</i>

53
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,060
<i>many reminiscing on
the life of the Mayor.</i>

54
00:05:09,297 --> 00:05:12,876
<i>A press conference has just been held
at Eisler Memorial Hospital</i>

55
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,026
<i>where the Mayor was taken.</i>

56
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:17,781
<i>The cause of
Mayor Roddecker's death</i>

57
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:19,883
<i>was due to a cerebral infarction
stemming from</i>

58
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:21,636
<i>a severe emphraxis
of the inner carotid artery</i>

59
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:27,473
We did everything we could for him,
but it caused severe brain swelling,

60
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:29,676
which resulted in
this unfortunate outcome.

61
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:33,879
<i>As for naming a successor,
a city official explained that</i>

62
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:36,787
<i>concrete steps will be taken</i>

63
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:38,188
<i>-as soon as possible.</i>
-I've got to get some sleep.

64
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:43,286
<i>In the case of the murder of
Mr. and Mrs. Liebert late last night...</i>

65
00:05:44,232 --> 00:05:46,758
<i>Judging from the signs of
a search in the rooms,</i>

66
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,165
<i>police believe
this may have been a robbery..</i>

67
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:51,103
<i>Or perhaps the act of
a political terrorist</i>

68
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:53,517
<i>against this couple
who had fled here from their country</i>

69
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,703
<i>A two-pronged investigation
is under way</i>

70
00:05:57,311 --> 00:05:59,302
<i>Of this couple's twin children, the son,</i>

71
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,848
<i>who received a gunshot wound
to the head</i>

72
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:03,910
<i>underwent successful surgery but...</i>

73
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:07,046
<i>has still to regain consciousness.
He is listed in critical condition.</i>

74
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,957
<i>Now, for the weather...</i>

75
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:12,218
<i>The whole country is</i>

76
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:13,260
<i>-in for clear weather...</i>
-That boy...

77
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:14,962
I wonder what will happen to him.

78
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:19,063
I'm just like him...

79
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:23,881
Mr. Reinhardt in ICU
is complaining that

80
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,737
she just can't sleep..

81
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:28,867
Can't we give her something
to help her sleep?

82
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:35,676
Dr. Tenma, are you listening to me?

83
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:36,793
Huh?

84
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:42,483
O-Oh...in that case,
give her one Halcyon tablet.

85
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:50,357
That man...! He's been unfocused
all day long.

86
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:52,866
Yo!

87
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:54,893
Dr. Becker...!

88
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:57,364
Seems you've had a trying time.

89
00:06:58,005 --> 00:06:59,871
Has the Director
handed down his judgment?

90
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:02,743
Huh?

91
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:05,744
I warned you, didn't I?

92
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:08,015
I told you the hospital
is ruled by politics.

93
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:10,761
If you played your cards right,

94
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:14,449
your future would have been
smooth sailing.

95
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:20,155
Well...I guess this means you and I
are in the same boat now.

96
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,660
Now, don't be so depressed.

97
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:29,669
You'll get a chance
to redeem your reputation.

98
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:33,237
Let's go have some drinks.
It'll cheer you up.

99
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:40,180
Uh, excuse me!

100
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:44,547
I still need to get a statement
from the girl twin...

101
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,297
I can't discuss that with you now,
Detective!

102
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:48,288
Huh?!

103
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,380
That girl is gone from her room!

104
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:51,582
What?!

105
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:56,006
That girl is always
slipping out of her room

106
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,794
and wandering through the hospital!

107
00:07:58,132 --> 00:07:59,099
Huh?!

108
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:09,741
...me...

109
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:14,406
Kill...

110
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:22,053
Kill me...

111
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:26,251
And so...

112
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:28,856
Eisler Memorial Hospital has
proven to be

113
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:32,661
the nation's leading medical facility.

114
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:34,478
That is first and foremost,

115
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:37,130
the result of our being blessed with

116
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:38,982
such excellent personnel
such as you all.

117
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:40,565
I am sincerely grateful.

118
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:45,445
Yesterday...

119
00:08:45,513 --> 00:08:48,949
unfortunately, the Mayor died
here in this hospital.

120
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:52,381
But, as always,
we had done our utmost to save him.

121
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,084
The public's evaluation of this hospital
has not changed one bit.

122
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:02,039
Let's have a round of applause
for Dr. Boyer and Dr. Eisen,

123
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:05,397
who strived to the end
to save the Mayor's life.

124
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:24,713
I looked at your paper.

125
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:27,248
I hope you will continue to
work on your research.

126
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:35,962
Director Heinemann!

127
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:41,759
Uh... I must apologize
for my actions...

128
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:48,171
Now, now... What's done is done.
Director?!

129
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:53,345
You did what you thought you should.
Let's leave it at that.

130
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:55,782
Director...

131
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:57,851
And now...

132
00:09:57,918 --> 00:10:01,548
let's have a word from
the Head of Neurosurgery!

133
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:05,690
Pardon me... I'm being called up.

134
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:07,653
It's not you.

135
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:09,463
Huh?

136
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,897
Here's the newly appointed...

137
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:16,163
Dr. Boyer, please...
Please come this way.

138
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:20,099
Sir, what is the meaning of this?

139
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:22,673
If you wish to remain at this hospital,
you may do so,

140
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:26,202
but you'd better give up the idea of
rising any further as a doctor.

141
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:29,126
That would be impossible for
someone with a flawed character

142
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,117
such as yours.

143
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:34,186
I'll recognize your skill as a surgeon,
but that is all.

144
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:36,116
You should also give up any ideas of

145
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:38,089
presenting any papers
at future conferences.

146
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,296
B-But, sir... Please listen to me.

147
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:45,342
Even if you wish to move
to another hospital,

148
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:47,630
I have no intention of
writing you a recommendation.

149
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,736
This means it's no use for you
to have any ambition.

150
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:53,506
You may consider your path
to becoming

151
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:55,099
the doctor you envisioned closed.

152
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:08,446
Surgery requires teamwork.

153
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,984
Only with the help of each
and every one of you

154
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:13,685
can a life be saved.

155
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,174
Eva...

156
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:33,780
Eva, won't you talk to your father
for me?

157
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:35,873
I haven't done anything wrong!

158
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,827
I just operated on
an emergency case

159
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:40,411
in the order in which
he was brought in!

160
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:55,297
That's...your engagement ring.

161
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:57,930
You're such a fool...

162
00:11:58,372 --> 00:11:59,339
Huh?

163
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,547
Eva!!

164
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:10,383
Why, Dr. Norden,
don't you look elegant?

165
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:14,450
As do you! You're more beautiful
than ever tonight, Eva.

166
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:48,919
What a laugh, isn't it?

167
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:53,236
After coming across
Director Heinemann's paper,

168
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,719
I came here to Germany,
and he made me what I am today...

169
00:12:57,965 --> 00:12:59,228
Now that I think about it,

170
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,031
I suppose that paper
that I was so impressed by

171
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,971
was probably written for him
by someone somewhere...

172
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,580
I knew that he was using me...

173
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,292
but I believed,
when I reached a certain position,

174
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:18,377
I would be able to work on research
of my choice to my heart's content.

175
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:25,084
<i>We are scholars, first and foremost.
Isn't that right?</i>

176
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:28,853
That's not right! Saving people's lives
is what's most important to a doctor!!

177
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:32,798
<i>After all, people's lives
aren't created equal.</i>

178
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,867
You're wrong!

179
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:35,561
There is no distinction
between people's lives!

180
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:37,795
I am not wrong!

181
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,273
You say there's a flaw
in my character?

182
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,508
What about you?!

183
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:44,106
You call yourself a doctor;
but you're just money hungry!

184
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,807
That bastard... That bastard...

185
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:49,216
He's better off dead!

186
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,322
I have you to thank...

187
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:04,061
You opened my eyes, as a doctor...

188
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:06,257
You must do your best to live.

189
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,659
I threw everything away
in order to operate on you...

190
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:15,837
That's how far I went
in order to bring you back to life.

191
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:44,900
You know your name, don't you?

192
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,973
Your name is Anna Liebert,
isn't that right?

193
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:58,813
I told you, didn't I, Detective?
It's too soon.

194
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:01,515
Can't anything be done, Doctor?

195
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:06,254
After all, she saw her parents
shot to death before her very eyes.

196
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,471
She has no physical wounds,

197
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:11,362
but extreme trauma seems to have
brought on amnesia.

198
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,024
Could you please refrain from

199
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:15,865
trying to get a statement from her
for a while?

200
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:18,731
This is a difficult case, you see...

201
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:21,841
The victim was
an East German diplomat.

202
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:26,339
If we don't solve this quickly,
the BKA will come.

203
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,076
Those guys always come

204
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:31,242
and steal the thunder from
us state police!

205
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:33,480
I haven't got the time to take it slow.

206
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:37,789
Oh... What if we do this?
We let her see her brother.

207
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:41,251
She'll be relieved to see him
and her memory might return.

208
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:45,661
I cannot agree on such a gamble–
one suggested by an amateur, at that!

209
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:48,866
Besides, Dr. Tenma
will probably not permit it.

210
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:50,003
Tenma?

211
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:52,003
He's the doctor
in charge of her brother Johan.

212
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:56,606
Tsk... What the heck
am I supposed to do?!

213
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:03,917
Well, Dr. Tenma...

214
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,921
You seem to be in a daze.
You look awfully tired.

215
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:11,121
I've been so busy
with emergency surgeries.

216
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,227
They've been working you
to the bone...

217
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:15,853
ever since you were
demoted from Chief.

218
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:19,858
I don't mind.
It actually makes me feel better.

219
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:22,727
Hey, now... Are you all right?

220
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:28,266
I'm sorry, I've just been paged.

221
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,677
You're so tired,
but you still have work to do?

222
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:35,443
The more diligent you are,
the worse it'll be for you!

223
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,145
Look at this, Director Heinemann...

224
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,385
See all the gifts
and letters of encouragement.

225
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:45,984
There are mountains of them
in his sister's room, too.

226
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:49,792
After losing their parents
these two only have each other.

227
00:16:49,997 --> 00:16:52,909
The mass media keeps reporting on
their heartbreaking plight,

228
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,094
and this is the result.

229
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:58,396
As far as this hospital is concerned,
they're nothing but an inconvenience;

230
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:00,234
what with no sign of anyone paying
their medical expenses.

231
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,330
Now, now...

232
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:04,001
So their story is a pitiful one–
that's just fine.

233
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:05,044
Huh?

234
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:07,842
That means this hospital is
garnering attention.

235
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:11,647
For that reason alone,
these kids are valuable...

236
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:13,353
Don't you see?

237
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,116
Uh, yes...

238
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:17,248
Why don't we do this...?

239
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:23,252
We'll give the media
a photo of the siblings together.

240
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:27,664
Yes, the media keeps asking
for something like that.

241
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:30,562
Do it. It'll be a picture
of the orphaned siblings

242
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:33,663
trying their best to live
within the warmhearted care

243
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:36,266
of our hospital's staff.

244
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,137
But the boy's doctor says
it is still too early

245
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:41,647
to allow them to see each other.

246
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:43,474
Who's on his case?

247
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:45,246
It's Dr. Tenma.

248
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,886
Dismiss him.

249
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:48,588
What?

250
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,149
There is no need to give that man
a position that gets so much attention.

251
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:56,658
Take Dr. Tenma off the case.

252
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,797
Yes, sir!

253
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,898
This is a heartwarming gift
from the citizens.

254
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:05,332
Why don't you have one?

255
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:07,040
Thank you.

256
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:18,149
How do you feel, Mrs. Hankel?

257
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:22,952
Thanks to you, I feel quite well.

258
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,568
Your stitches will be removed soon,

259
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:26,855
so it won't be long
until you're released.

260
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:29,322
I'll be able to go home?

261
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:33,664
Yes, but as I said, you must rest.

262
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:35,628
Of course, I will.

263
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,136
Give Mrs. Hankel regular doses

264
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:40,674
of an anticonvulsant
and a hypotensive.

265
00:18:46,313 --> 00:18:47,280
Wake up, Anna!

266
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:51,080
W-What are you doing?

267
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:52,575
Dr. Tenma!

268
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,887
They let her see her brother.
Then she gave a loud scream and...

269
00:18:58,191 --> 00:18:59,249
Why did you bring them together?!

270
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:10,527
Dr. Tenma...

271
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:11,804
Take her back to her room, quickly!

272
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:13,039
Yes, sir!

273
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,632
Dr. Boyer, what is the meaning of this?
Why the camera?

274
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:21,257
Oh... We're going to give the media

275
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:23,010
a picture of the emotional meeting
of the two children.

276
00:19:23,884 --> 00:19:28,014
Who allowed you to do such a thing?
I am the boy's doctor.

277
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:31,050
You have been dismissed
as Johan's doctor.

278
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:32,325
Wha...?!

279
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:34,349
As of today, he is my patient.

280
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:37,965
I decided that it would be fine
to let them see each other.

281
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:42,535
Those children...

282
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,633
Don't make those children fodder
for the media!

283
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:47,232
We did it by order of the Director.

284
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:50,374
I think it would be best for you
not to fight it.

285
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,179
I'm the one who saved this boy!

286
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:54,846
I have a duty to protect him
until he is completely healed!

287
00:19:55,182 --> 00:19:57,173
If that's the case,
take a look at the boy's reaction!

288
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:09,258
As soon as he saw his sister,
he extended his hand and cried tears.

289
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:13,093
He regained consciousness
and showed a normal reaction.

290
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,298
That means the surgery
was a great success.

291
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:20,163
Good job. Your work is done now.

292
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:23,305
Get back to where you belong.

293
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:37,922
Damn it...
Don't make me laugh!

294
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,429
Who cares what the Director says?

295
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:45,532
Who cares what the Chief says?

296
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:51,198
They're all money and power hungry!

297
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:53,337
Damn them...!

298
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:06,078
I... I am not wrong...

299
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:22,466
I'm home, Father...

300
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,601
Father? Are you in your room?

301
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:42,020
Chief...?
Are you still in a meeting at this hour?

302
00:21:59,873 --> 00:22:01,967
Father, are you asleep?

303
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
I'm coming in.

304
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:31,969
That bastard... He's better off dead...
