1
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:10,164
CHECK PLACEMENT Honestly.
You're such a troublemaker!

2
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:12,826
How many times are you
going to pretend to run away?

3
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:15,369
The next time you do it,
you won't get dinner!

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,796
Understand, Milosh?!

5
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:18,072
All right.

6
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:20,401
Take your hands out of your pockets
when you talk to me!

7
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:22,276
All right.

8
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:24,044
Really?!

9
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:25,079
It's true.

10
00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:26,636
It was the blonde lady.

11
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:29,574
You saw her on
Dominican Street, right?

12
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:31,483
I wonder if she lives
in that area.

13
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:34,455
Why didn't you follow her
all the way?!

14
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:37,720
I was hungry and
my stomach was growling.

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,118
In that case, we've got to find out where
the lady is and turn her over to the police.

16
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:44,795
Mr. Grimmer didn't
kill the director.

17
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,160
We've got to prove
his innocence.

18
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:50,198
Prove his innocence?
Will that save Mr. Grimmer?

19
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:52,467
That's right! We're having
a strategy meeting right now.

20
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,407
Milosh, hurry and eat your food.

21
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:44,247
This is the underground orphanage,
where the first incident occurred.

22
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:49,789
Someone killed the former director
of 511 Kinderheim.

23
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:52,452
The children say that
a blonde woman

24
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:54,518
walked passed them
right after the incident.

25
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,060
He was conducting
an experiment here.

26
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,659
It was the complete opposite of
what happened at 511 Kinderheim.

27
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,236
It seems he was experimenting
with giving the children affection.

28
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,572
What do you want to do?
Do you want to go in?

29
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,280
The police probably stripped away
all the evidence already.

30
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:13,981
Mr. Grimmer, what's that?

31
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:19,082
"To Mr. Police Officer!
Mr. Grimmer is innocent."

32
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,854
"To Mr. Detective!
The blonde lady is the killer."

33
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:24,749
It's those children...

34
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:29,021
The orphanage children came back
and posted these up.

35
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:35,796
"To Mr. Grimmer..."

36
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,040
Milan Boucek. ..
A card of a famous soccer player.

37
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,342
It's valuable to the children.

38
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:49,974
How should I react?

39
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:54,555
What kind of expression
should I make in this situation?

40
00:03:58,025 --> 00:04:02,428
My emotions were taken
from me at 511 Kinderheim.

41
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:07,758
Afterwards, I was taught various
emotional expressions at a strange school.

42
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:10,504
But situations like this
are the most difficult.

43
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,436
What's the right way
to react to this?

44
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,006
Why don't you go and
see those children?

45
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,353
You're Mr. Grimmer?

46
00:04:26,888 --> 00:04:30,381
I always hear things from
the children about you.

47
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,258
The children are out playing.
They haven't come back yet.

48
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:37,690
If only they'd come back earlier.

49
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:44,902
Take a look! The children's journals...
Or rather, a lot of letters written to you!

50
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:47,898
"Mr. Grimmer,
let's play soccer again."

51
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,540
"Mr. Grimmer, I'll teach you how to play
soccer since you're not very good at it!"

52
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:55,775
"Mr. Grimmer,
let's all play together again."

53
00:04:57,985 --> 00:05:01,148
I'm smiling right now, aren't I?

54
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,356
I learned this.

55
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,052
I learned the form
of a smiling face.

56
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:14,791
I'm remaining in
peoples' memories?

57
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:20,496
Why...do those children. ..
care about me?

58
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,274
That's because they love you.

59
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:27,073
Love...

60
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:36,380
Before, when my son died,
I was thinking of how I should react.

61
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,994
How should I cry in this situation?
How long should I cry?

62
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:47,162
Should I scream,
or should I clench my teeth?

63
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:50,995
Even now,
I still don't know what to do.

64
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:56,433
I don't know.

65
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:02,914
Mr. Grimmer!

66
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:05,279
Hey, Antonio.

67
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,347
Mr. Grimmer, bad news!

68
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:08,851
What's wrong, Antonio?

69
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,220
We got word from the kids at
Ceske Orphanage ! I-It's terrible.

70
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:16,927
Calm down, Antonio. Calm
down and tell me what happened.

71
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:19,823
They found the blonde lady.

72
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:23,799
Yesterday,
we all kept watch to find her.

73
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,400
And then, Milosh...

74
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:28,239
Milosh disappeared!

75
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:39,241
CHECK PLACEMENT I see. The
people who have come to see you were

76
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,757
a middle-aged gentleman,
a tall German man,

77
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:45,349
and a long-haired
Japanese man?

78
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:47,954
Yes.

79
00:06:49,096 --> 00:06:53,761
I think you may have forgotten
another person who came to see you.

80
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:59,530
According to the nurse, a long-haired
blonde woman came to see you.

81
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:03,910
Woman? No.
A woman never came.

82
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:09,676
No, the nurse was sure.
She was very beautiful.

83
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:12,481
Yes, very beautiful.

84
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:16,253
But he was a man.

85
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:18,918
I see.

86
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:22,755
What's your name?

87
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:24,831
Milosh.

88
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,101
Have we met somewhere?

89
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:29,028
Huh?

90
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:30,765
N-No.

91
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:33,505
What were you doing there?

92
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:35,542
Nothing.

93
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:40,109
You walk around this area often,
don't you?

94
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:41,906
Y-Yeah.

95
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:44,782
What are you looking for?

96
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,949
U-Umm. .. My mom.

97
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,621
Don't just stand there.
Why don't you have a seat?

98
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:54,484
There's some juice.

99
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,495
Umm.. .
Are you going to move?

100
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:02,428
Why do you ask?

101
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:07,304
Because you have a big bag.
And there's nothing in this room.

102
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:16,182
Is your mother somewhere
around here?

103
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:17,110
Huh?

104
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:20,948
You said you were looking for
your mother, didn't you?

105
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:25,150
Yeah. But I don't know if
she's around here.

106
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,260
Then how will you find her? Do
you have her picture or something?

107
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:31,064
I don't have one.

108
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:34,230
Then you won't know her face.

109
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:37,697
I'll know! I'll know my mom
when I see her face!

110
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,837
No one at the orphanage
believes me!

111
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:42,337
Everyone says that
I won't be able to tell.

112
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:45,312
But I'll know my mom
when I see her!

113
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:46,472
And...

114
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:47,974
And?

115
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:51,077
Mom will know me
when she sees me!

116
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:02,085
Even if you find her, what if she
acts as if she doesn't know you?

117
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:04,490
Huh?

118
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,197
Were you born because
you were wanted?

119
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:11,801
Why were you abandoned?

120
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:17,469
Didn't your mother abandon you
because she hated you?

121
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,248
N-No!

122
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:25,648
There's nothing special
about being born.

123
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,946
Huh?

124
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:30,388
Most of the universe is "death."

125
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:39,424
Compared to the universe, the lives created
on Earth are short and insignificant.

126
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:42,197
Death is normal.

127
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:44,666
So why live?

128
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:47,238
Was it because
someone wanted you?

129
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:52,674
Who wanted you?

130
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,948
What's your reason for living?

131
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:06,085
A beautiful,
long-haired blonde woman?

132
00:10:06,594 --> 00:10:09,120
Oh, that would be Anna.

133
00:10:09,597 --> 00:10:10,792
A-Anna!

134
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:15,527
Does this woman, Anna,
live around here?

135
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:18,602
Yes. I believe she lives
in the apartment

136
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:22,108
at the end of the dead-end street
two corners down.

137
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,741
Well, she's a very nice girl.

138
00:10:24,812 --> 00:10:27,679
She's good-natured
and always greets me.

139
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:31,983
Anna? Yes, yes,
she's a nice girl.

140
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,884
She always calls out
to me with a smile.

141
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:37,419
Do you know which room
and which floor she lives on?

142
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,486
Yes. Over there.

143
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:41,658
That window on the third floor.

144
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,494
If what the children said is true...

145
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:51,001
And... If it's true that
that woman kidnapped Milosh...

146
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:55,107
If that woman, Anna, who's living here
is the same one we're looking for, then...

147
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:02,949
And if that woman is
the person I think she is,

148
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:05,281
everything will end now,
right here!

149
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,735
She got away.

150
00:11:28,776 --> 00:11:30,676
Where did Milosh go?

151
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:34,441
No. Was he captured?

152
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:39,476
He was following that blonde woman
to prove my innocence.

153
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:44,356
What should I do, Dr. Tenma?

154
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,789
How should I react
in this situation?

155
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:56,028
Those children got involved in this because
they were trying to prove my innocence.

156
00:11:57,204 --> 00:12:02,335
The children told you that Milosh
usually walks around Prague

157
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:04,377
in search of his mother,
didn't they?

158
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,571
He wants to meet
his mother, huh?

159
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,053
I didn't feel anything
when my own son died.

160
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,654
One day, a female coworker
from the newspaper company

161
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,661
where I worked spoke to me.

162
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:26,628
She told me that she loved me.
I married her.

163
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:32,701
I was told that I wouldn't be suspected of
conducting spy activities if I was married.

164
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:37,533
She got pregnant
and she had a boy.

165
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:41,343
One day, my wife went shopping
not far from home.

166
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:44,683
When I went into
my son's room,

167
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:47,345
he was lying down flat
and wasn't breathing.

168
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:50,282
I applied artificial respiration.

169
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:52,489
At the same time,
I called the doctor.

170
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:57,289
I did everything I should have done.
Perfectly.

171
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,793
But he died.

172
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:05,238
At the funeral,
my wife raged at me.

173
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:08,201
"How can you stay so calm?"

174
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:09,867
"How can you not cry?"

175
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:13,506
"You're always,
always like that."

176
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:15,607
"You were like that
with me, too."

177
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,777
"You can't love people."

178
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:20,581
"There's nothing
in your heart."

179
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:24,888
Then my wife left.

180
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:29,627
I have to find Milosh.

181
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:33,832
You said that Milosh was
the child of a prostitute

182
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:36,632
from a red-light district near
the Czech border, didn't you?

183
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:38,097
Yeah.

184
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:42,437
If the person that was here,
is the person I think she is...

185
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,502
I don't think they'll
let the boy live!

186
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,242
But they won't just kill him.

187
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:54,981
The person
I'm thinking of

188
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:58,719
would probably kill him after
doing the cruelest thing possible.

189
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:06,098
Germany is straight this way.

190
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,229
Is my mom along
the way there?

191
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:11,137
There's a lively place
up ahead.

192
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:13,303
I can meet my mom, right?

193
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,533
I'll wait here.
You go on alone.

194
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:20,475
You'll know who your mother is
if you see her.

195
00:14:20,948 --> 00:14:23,679
And your mother will know
who you are if she sees you.

196
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:32,953
But if no one calls out to you, that
means that you weren't wanted by anyone.

197
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,957
What will you do then?

198
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:39,032
What will you do?

199
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:43,295
Go.

200
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:57,643
Mom.

201
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:26,375
Cruel, huh?

202
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,629
Thank you, thank you.

203
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:52,431
What is it, kid?

204
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,366
I'm looking for someone.

205
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,804
Looking for who?

206
00:15:58,045 --> 00:15:59,012
My mom.

207
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:03,348
Your mom?!
This is great.

208
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:06,179
What's so funny?

209
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:09,547
Yeah, I know your mom.

210
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:10,249
Huh?

211
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:12,319
Where?! Where is she?

212
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:13,893
Well...

213
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:19,861
Of the ones I know. ..
there are about 50!

214
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,139
<i>Why were you abandoned?</i>

215
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,306
Hey Kid!

216
00:16:30,844 --> 00:16:32,778
Kid, Kid!

217
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:35,007
Who are you, Ma'am?

218
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:36,439
It's all right. It's all right.

219
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:40,045
Umm.. .
I'm...looking for my mom.

220
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,765
Just let me hold you like this.

221
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:44,553
What's with that kid?!

222
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:47,554
He's not your kid, is he?

223
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,131
Of course not!

224
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,435
I don't make mistakes like that!

225
00:16:57,504 --> 00:16:59,598
You get diseases, though.

226
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:01,731
Shut up! Want to fight?!
Come on!

227
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:03,239
What are you doing?

228
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,277
Let go of me!

229
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:06,405
H-Hold on. No!

230
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:07,571
Not here!

231
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:11,877
I paid you. I'm a customer.
Do as your customer says!

232
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:13,482
But hold on.

233
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,651
Oh! A child's watching!

234
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:19,018
Wait.

235
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:22,724
Watch. Don't run away.

236
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,265
I'm a teacher in Germany.

237
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:32,896
At school, I'm a gentleman who's
highly praised by parents,

238
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:34,407
and a wonderful teacher.

239
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,676
I'm a wonderful teacher.

240
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:48,647
Take this.

241
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:54,284
<i>Who wanted you?</i>

242
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:58,389
Kid... Money...

243
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:00,190
Are you sick, Ma'am?

244
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:04,027
I'm.. .I'm going to die soon.

245
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:05,803
Why are you here?

246
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,602
I told you, didn't I?
I'm going to die soon.

247
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:12,068
Gimme money.

248
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:14,607
I only have this.

249
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:23,249
<i>Most of the universe is death.</i>

250
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:28,860
<i>Who wanted you?</i>

251
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:35,034
<i>What's your reason for living?</i>

252
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:51,551
I see.

253
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:00,591
So that's it.

254
00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:13,098
The red-light district
ends around here.

255
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:19,207
There are several people in town
who have seen Milosh.

256
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:23,547
Shall we turn back?
He still might be in there.

257
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:31,450
Milosh...

258
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:43,770
Milosh...

259
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:49,039
It's all right. It's all right.

260
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:56,680
Okay. Now come here.

261
00:19:57,617 --> 00:20:04,148
You tried your best to clear
my name, didn't you?

262
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:10,564
It's all right now.
Come here.

263
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:29,148
It's all right. It's all right.

264
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:34,577
Is this good, Dr. Tenma?

265
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,480
Would it be better if I cried?

266
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:45,598
I was never taught. ..
such a difficult emotion.

267
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:01,942
What's wrong, Milosh?!

268
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,623
What did you see?
What have you seen?

269
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:17,054
What did you find out?

270
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,570
Milosh. .. Listen to me.
You have no mother.

271
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:34,371
But... But...
You were born for a reason!

272
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:39,349
You were born because
someone wanted you!

273
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:45,554
Definitely...
Someone definitely wanted you.

274
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:48,985
Definitely...

275
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:12,285
Say, Dr. Tenma.
I'm not wrong, am I?

276
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,180
No...

277
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:21,051
What expression. ..
do I have...right now?

278
00:22:24,564 --> 00:22:25,622
You're crying.
