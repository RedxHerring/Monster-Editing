1
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:38,886
So...

2
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:40,950
you're Roberto.

3
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:44,491
I have no name.

4
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,658
That's unfortunate.

5
00:01:49,163 --> 00:01:51,257
As a police officer,

6
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:55,929
I'd prefer to know the name of
the criminal who's going to kill me.

7
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:35,894
Oh. This is terrible.

8
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,863
He was such a good person.

9
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:41,342
He risked his life for us.

10
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,700
Mr. Grimmer...

11
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:53,580
Dr. Tenma,
where are you going?

12
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:56,252
I can't waste any time.

13
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:59,619
You're going to where
Inspector Lunge is, aren't you?

14
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:02,989
I'm going, too. I have a gun.

15
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:05,125
This letter...

16
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:10,329
This letter that Inspector Lunge
gave to Mr. Grimmer...

17
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,002
It seems that Inspector Lunge
found it at Red Rose Mansion.

18
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,375
"I've been watching you."

19
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,885
"I've been watching
so I could devour you whole."

20
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,347
"But instead,
everything about you consumed me."

21
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:33,988
"When I was falling apart,
how did I look to you?"

22
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:38,697
"When I was falling apart,
the object that you gave me.. ."

23
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,036
"You left me a beautiful jewel."

24
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:46,839
"The twins who look as if they
were blessed with eternal life."

25
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:56,409
"The most sinful deed is to
take away a person's name."

26
00:04:57,785 --> 00:04:58,980
"Let's get your name back."

27
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:02,049
"I'll give you your name back."

28
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:04,681
"Your name is Anna."

29
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,555
"Right now, I'm just sad."

30
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:08,822
"Sad."

31
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:10,123
"Sad."

32
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:11,691
"Sad."

33
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:13,359
"Sad."

34
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:15,595
"Sad."

35
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:26,002
You wrote this, didn't you?

36
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:31,279
I. ..fell in love with
the mother of the twins.

37
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:36,450
My mind changed in an instant.

38
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:40,119
So...

39
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:43,959
The people who knew about her. ..
about the twins...

40
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:46,022
and about the experiment...

41
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,262
I killed them all.

42
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,597
That's all.

43
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:37,777
Answer me. Who are you?

44
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:41,785
If you don't get that wound treated,
it'll kill you.

45
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:44,450
Answer me if you
want to be saved.

46
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,554
Where is Johan?

47
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:51,197
Why do you go
so far for Johan?

48
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,998
What's your relationship
with him?

49
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:58,031
You've fallen quite far in the world,
haven't you, Inspector Lunge?

50
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:05,808
The BKA's best investigator is in
this rural village all by himself...

51
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:09,481
You went sightseeing
without a badge.

52
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:15,265
You investigated too deep into a
scandal involving a parliament member

53
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:16,950
and lost work.

54
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:21,322
Chasing Tenma became
your only reason for living.

55
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:25,325
That's right. I'm impressed
you researched that.

56
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,534
Your wife.. .
Is living with another man.

57
00:07:30,871 --> 00:07:32,600
She looks so happy.

58
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:38,234
And your grandson thinks
that man is his grandfather.

59
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,342
He can speak now...

60
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:46,244
And he calls him
"Grandpa, Grandpa."

61
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:47,880
Shut up.

62
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:50,787
You want to see him,
don't you?

63
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:52,318
Shut up.

64
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,288
Your grandson is
growing up beautifully.

65
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:56,923
Shut up.

66
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:59,097
You want to see him,
don't you?

67
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,057
Shut up!

68
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,731
You've fallen.

69
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,846
The old Inspector Lunge
wasn't like this.

70
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:49,372
"Who am I?"

71
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:52,381
"What's my relationship
with Johan?"

72
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:57,685
I have no name. I have no country.
I have no memories.

73
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:01,894
Before I realized it, I was out
of the orphanage and working.

74
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:07,991
One day,
Johan appeared before me.

75
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:13,870
He awakened
one of my memories.

76
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,571
Just one memory.

77
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:23,941
What is his real name?

78
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:25,681
He said that he didn't know.

79
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,881
His own name?

80
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:29,249
Yeah.

81
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,388
He said that he was
from an orphanage.

82
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:36,227
He said that he had
forgotten everyone else,

83
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:38,732
but he remembered
his friend's name.

84
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:43,597
He forgot his name,
but remembered his friend's?

85
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:48,670
Yeah. His friend liked
drawing and bugs.

86
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,670
But he didn't like killing bugs,
so he let them go from their cages.

87
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:59,277
I believe his name was...
Adolph Reinhardt.

88
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:05,722
He loved the hot cocoa that was
given to them once each week.

89
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:14,763
Johan came to me. ..
and handed me a cup.

90
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,266
I remembered the thing I looked
forward to each week in that orphanage.

91
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:28,672
I loved that hot cocoa.

92
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,818
It would be nice if the rain
would wash everything away.

93
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,924
Fear, hate, and sadness...

94
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:49,194
But it's quite the opposite.

95
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:54,166
Everything gets worse.

96
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:58,513
Even on that day,
it was raining like this.

97
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:03,851
<i>Mr. Liebert, former head of
the East German Trade Commission,</i>

98
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:06,387
<i>who fled to the West from
East Germany just the other day</i>

99
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:09,787
<i>appeared before the media
with his wife and children.</i>

100
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,158
<i>The Lieberts didn't appear
to be exhausted.</i>

101
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:16,653
<i>And their two children have
bright expressions on their faces.</i>

102
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:23,695
Are you a refugee as well?

103
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:26,166
Yes. From Czechoslovakia...

104
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:29,436
You say that you
know the children?

105
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:31,472
Please let me see them.

106
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:33,637
Just one look.

107
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,175
Even just their
sleeping faces.

108
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:01,835
A tragedy occurred
that night...

109
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:07,640
<i>One girl is confirmed
to be alive!</i>

110
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:09,044
<i>A man and a woman
are dead!</i>

111
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:11,175
<i>The boy is in serious condition
but he has a pulse!</i>

112
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:11,977
<i>Where's the patient?!</i>

113
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,587
<i>Blood pressure, 72/50...</i>

114
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,052
<i>Pulse, 138!</i>

115
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:16,956
<i>The bullet went in
through his forehead?!</i>

116
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:23,492
<i>Kill...</i>

117
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:33,672
I didn't know what in the world
had happened.

118
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:37,444
No. I knew.

119
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,981
I knew everything,
but I ran away.

120
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:50,256
I stopped thinking about
anything and ran away.

121
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,653
I tried to draw.

122
00:12:55,863 --> 00:13:00,232
Pictures of those ideal twins...
Of them surrounded by love...

123
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:05,396
But. ..no matter how many I drew,
I couldn't draw it.

124
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:12,576
Because I knew that
it didn't exist.

125
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:21,644
Inspector Lunge is at Hotel Bergbach.
That's just up ahead, right?

126
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:23,149
Yes.

127
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:25,584
Let's go. Be careful.

128
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,286
We don't know where
they're coming from.

129
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:28,595
I...

130
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:34,596
I created a monster.

131
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:43,741
I brought that monster
back to life.

132
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:06,960
This won't kill you, will it?

133
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:09,802
I don't have much grip
in my right hand.

134
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:13,566
Dr. Tenma shot me
in a library in Munich.

135
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:17,242
It would have been easy
to kill him there.

136
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:19,877
But I can't kill him.

137
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:23,542
Dr. Tenma is the one
who's to be left.

138
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:27,551
He'll be the one left in the end. ..
all alone.

139
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:30,484
He's going to die
alone and sad.

140
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,559
Without a name.

141
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,025
This is part of Johan's plan.

142
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:43,369
Dr. Tenma will be allowed to
see the sight Johan has seen.

143
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:46,267
I want to see that sight, too.

144
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:48,933
I want to see it.

145
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:54,246
Inspector Lunge...
you won't see it.

146
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:56,979
You're going to die.

147
00:14:58,685 --> 00:14:59,652
This is also part of...

148
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:04,748
Johan's plan.

149
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:28,607
Plans?

150
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:33,877
The computer in my head tells me
that doesn't add up.

151
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:35,955
Answer me.

152
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:37,752
Where is Johan?!

153
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:41,961
This is terrible.

154
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:43,921
It's like a battlefield.

155
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:46,363
Johan is not here.

156
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:48,601
How do you know?

157
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:51,729
He's watching this
from somewhere.

158
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,367
As if he were watching
a line of ants...

159
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:03,376
Anyway, let's look inside.
Tenma was headed here.

160
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:07,745
Someone! Is anyone here?!

161
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:10,056
I'll look on the second floor.

162
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,459
A child?

163
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:23,161
Don't come near me!

164
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:27,774
It's all right. We're on your side.
We've come to help.

165
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:34,548
Look. I'm not holding anything.
Okay? It's all right, right?

166
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:35,975
Oh.

167
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:39,686
The woman in the picture...

168
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:43,552
"The woman in the picture"?

169
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:46,450
There were lots of pictures.

170
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:49,021
You look exactly like the girl
in those pictures.

171
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:51,456
"Lots of pictures"?

172
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:55,868
There's a boy with the same face.
They were pictures of twins.

173
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:03,910
Where did you
see those pictures?!

174
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:06,746
Where did you see them?!

175
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:12,747
Th-The hill to the south...

176
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:15,350
At the "Vampire's House."

177
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:31,132
Hey. Does anybody know?

178
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:35,236
Do you know where my son is?
Hey...

179
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:38,003
Wim, where did you go?!

180
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:42,443
Everyone's dead.

181
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:49,455
It's the devil.

182
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:58,265
The devil has come
to this town!

183
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:05,170
There's no one here
anymore.

184
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:17,210
Johan was here just
a moment ago doing that.

185
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:19,152
Is that what you're saying?

186
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:23,285
They're all attempts at
drawing the two of you.

187
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:25,392
But they were left unfinished.

188
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,957
All the pictures look like
they're smiling affectionately...

189
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:34,996
But did Franz Bonaparta
draw these pictures?

190
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:38,802
What did Johan do upon
seeing these pictures?

191
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,466
...home.

192
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:44,745
I'm back. Welcome home.

193
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:48,272
I'm back. Welcome home.

194
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:52,045
I'm back. Welcome home.

195
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,983
I'm back. Welcome home.

196
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:57,249
Nina...

197
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:04,591
I saw something
very frightening.

198
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,101
Something really,
really frightening...

199
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:13,205
Many people died.

200
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:16,465
Red Rose Mansion...

201
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:19,310
Everyone drank alcohol.

202
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:22,914
And when they did...
When they did...

203
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:27,385
Everyone suffered and collapsed on
top of each other right before my eyes!

204
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:47,803
Where's my mom?

205
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:02,689
I'm sorry.

206
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,090
Why are you apologizing?

207
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:09,729
That time...

208
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:17,503
The two of you
have to keep on living.

209
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,938
The two of you, keep on living.

210
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:27,503
Why are you crying?

211
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,279
Why are you crying?!

212
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:33,943
Don't cry!

213
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:35,555
Don't cry!

214
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:36,856
Don't cry!

215
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,223
Don't cry!

216
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:39,726
Don't cry!

217
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:42,059
Don't cry!

218
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:50,695
Nina!

219
00:20:57,978 --> 00:20:58,604
Nina?

220
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:03,744
He.. .was crying.

221
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:06,479
Nina...

222
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,423
In this room...

223
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:16,495
Just until a while ago,
in this room, by himself.

224
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,527
He cried just like
he did back then.

225
00:21:25,572 --> 00:21:29,065
That rainy night...
If I hadn't shot him...

226
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,487
If I had forgiven him,
this wouldn't have continued.

227
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:48,818
All these people
wouldn't have died.

228
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:57,067
It may be too late.

229
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:00,899
But this time...

230
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:09,411
Where is Johan now?

231
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:17,250
He went into town...

232
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:22,793
in order to end all of this.
