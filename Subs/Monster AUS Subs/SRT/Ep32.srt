1
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,149
Hi, Karl.

2
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,552
Hey, Lotte.

3
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,216
Do you have a moment?

4
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:24,123
No, not really. What is it?

5
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,458
N-Nothing.

6
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,059
I was thinking we could get
tea or something.

7
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,608
I thought that we could
talk a bit more

8
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,861
about the events
surrounding Mr. Schuwald.

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,468
It's okay, everything's fine now.

10
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:37,870
But...

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,473
Sorry. I'm in a hurry right now.

12
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,575
My father has a meeting
he has to attend.

13
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:45,704
See you later.

14
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,840
There's going to be a dance.
I thought that we could...

15
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,493
The library will be closing.

16
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,156
O-Okay.

17
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,130
We're closing.

18
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,838
That girl's here again.

19
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,545
<i>She's beautiful...
God sure is unfair.</i>

20
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,607
<i>I'm sure that she doesn't
have any problems.</i>

21
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,214
<i>But that girl...</i>

22
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,323
It's closing time!

23
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,591
Oh, yes!

24
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:13,752
Jeez...

25
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,635
I've seen her somewhere.

26
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,970
A dance?

27
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,576
Yes, that's right.

28
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,780
I'm not really interested in
those kinds of things,

29
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,410
but a friend forced me to
buy some tickets.

30
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,746
Sorry. I can't tonight.

31
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,816
Huh?

32
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,859
I have a dinner with members
of the state assembly.

33
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,394
It's not a normal dinner party.

34
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,563
I'm sure there are lots of guys
who'd escort you.

35
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:56,862
See you later.

36
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,862
Oh.

37
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,537
It's not as if I really want to go.

38
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,959
You're...

39
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,097
Oh?

40
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,274
You're investigating
Margot Langer, too?

41
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,307
There's no need to erase it!

42
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,946
I'm also investigating her.

43
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:41,907
Huh?

44
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,209
It's for a paper.

45
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,443
I'm Lotte Frank,
a cultural anthropology major.

46
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:48,647
What about you?

47
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:55,323
I see you're quite brilliant,
Miss Nina Fortner.

48
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,894
This is the accountant murder case.

49
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,096
This is a newspaper article about
the voice of god murder case.

50
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,468
And this is the middle-aged couple
murder case.

51
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,572
You're amazing.

52
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,065
I have confidence in my ability
to gather information,

53
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,109
but you put me to shame.

54
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,774
I've been investigating
the unsolved murder cases

55
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,939
that have happened in Bavaria
over the past four years.

56
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:20,851
Could you tell me more about the murder
of Margot Langer, the ex-prostitute?

57
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,479
I just told you what I know.

58
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:29,528
The child born to Margot Langer
and Hans Schuwald, the tycoon,

59
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:33,589
has been recognized by his father
and is now his heir.

60
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,069
What is the possibility
that his son was involved

61
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,331
in the events
surrounding Schuwald?

62
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,808
That's not possible.
Not at all.

63
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:45,570
I see.

64
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,674
You're rather enthusiastic
about your topic.

65
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:52,976
For someone who's just writing a paper,
you seem pretty involved in your topic.

66
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,749
Y-You think so?

67
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,322
This isn't for a research paper, is it?

68
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,987
To be honest,
I'm looking for someone.

69
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,096
Can I ask you one question?

70
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,761
Do people like you have things
they worry about?

71
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:10,662
Huh?

72
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:17,233
Well, beautiful girls like you get
everything they want, don't they?

73
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,939
What are you trying to say?!

74
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:24,944
For example, you've never had
romantic problems, have you?

75
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,513
It's okay. You don't have
the worries I have, do you?

76
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,554
God really is unfair.

77
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,830
Say! Want to come with me tonight
to a dance party?

78
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,375
I don't really care for places like this.

79
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,350
Come on, don't say that.

80
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,321
Guys will talk to us as long
as you're with me.

81
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,518
Look. Everyone's looking at us.

82
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:08,851
Hey.

83
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,464
I'll just take the leftovers.

84
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,260
Lotte...

85
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,767
Hi.

86
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,095
Look, they're coming.

87
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,669
Hi!

88
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,897
I'm Constantine from
the Supernatural Phenomenon Club!

89
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,275
Pleased to meet you!

90
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,674
My goodness.
A really weird one's come.

91
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,071
You sure got some nerve,
talking to Nina with a face like yours.

92
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,450
Uh, Lotte!

93
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,411
Huh?

94
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,352
Would you like to be
my partner for tonight?

95
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,489
M-Me?

96
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,549
What's the meaning of this?

97
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,389
Aren't you glad, Lotte?

98
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,190
I'll be off now.

99
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,991
Hey, wait, Nina!

100
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,967
He's not my type!
He's not my type at all!

101
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,404
Stay with me, Nina.

102
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,065
Damn it.

103
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,809
We're kind of depressing.

104
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,382
Yeah.

105
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:08,613
Yeah"? So many people
talked to you!

106
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,785
Nina, you're too cold.

107
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,258
I'm not trying to be.

108
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,787
But I'm having fun for the
first time in a while.

109
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,090
Huh?

110
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,565
Students are hanging out and everyone is
having fun joking with each other.

111
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,329
It's really been a while.

112
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,869
Nina, are you...

113
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,033
N-Nothing.

114
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,515
You're pretty straight-laced,
despite your looks.

115
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,545
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?!

116
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:54,863
Hey, Lotte.
Please, dance with me.

117
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,762
Woah, he's come again.

118
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,234
You're being pushy.

119
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,599
Just a little is fine. Just a little...

120
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,374
And you're drunk.

121
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,436
Come on.

122
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,445
No. Let go of me.

123
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,837
Cut it out!

124
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,116
It's not as if I'm asking you
because I like you!

125
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,147
What did you say?! That's rude!

126
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,685
Anyway, dance with me just once.

127
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,626
No! Stop.

128
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,160
I'll get paid if you do.

129
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,466
Paid?! What do you mean?

130
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,896
It doesn't mean anything.

131
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,096
Karl asked me to.

132
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,967
He asked me to be
your partner for tonight.

133
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,044
By Karl?

134
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:44,445
So all you have to do is dance
with me a little.

135
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,777
Stop.

136
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,214
Don't say that.

137
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,321
Stop!

138
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,889
Just for one song is fine.

139
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,518
Huh?

140
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,363
Ow ow ow! Ow! Ow!
Sorry. It hurts.

141
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,932
I won't do it anymore!
I won't do it anymore!

142
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:07,632
Ow! Stop!

143
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,069
Let's go.

144
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,388
I liked him, that's why...

145
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:37,333
I liked Karl, that's why
I helped him find his father.

146
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,699
I liked him.

147
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:47,111
But ever since he proved
that he's Schuwald's real son...

148
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,273
He has business with his father.

149
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:55,520
He promised his father something.
His father. His father.

150
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,954
It hurts. It hurts...

151
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,097
I never thought that being dumped
would hurt so much!

152
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,004
It does hurt.

153
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,434
There are only painful things.

154
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,748
But it's all right.
It'll be all right.

155
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,221
Bad things don't last forever.

156
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,493
You mustn't let them continue,
all right?

157
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,866
All right, I'll be going now.

158
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,069
Tell me where to contact you, Nina!

159
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,305
Sorry. I still haven't found
a place to live.

160
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,714
Then call my house!

161
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,883
Promise me.

162
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:58,710
Okay.

163
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,611
Today was fun.

164
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,278
I hope you find the person
you're looking for.

165
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:25,200
Nina... She...
I thought I saw her somewhere.

166
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,778
She looks exactly like Johan.

167
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,867
You're pretty good with that, Doctor.

168
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,878
Well, it's rather the efficiency of
the gun rather than your skill.

169
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,148
That rifle was rejected as the official
sniper rifle of the German army,

170
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:14,250
but it can hit the center of
a 5-cm target from 300 meters away.

171
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,987
Even an amateur could do it.

172
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,063
I don't know what
you're going to shoot,

173
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,092
but your aim gets better
the closer you get to the target.

174
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:30,505
All that's left is finding a place where
you can get a clear shot at your target.

175
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,002
The bullets are .338 Lapua Magnums.

176
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,575
There are four of them in there.

177
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,185
But you don't have the time
to fire all four of them.

178
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,753
It's over if you don't finish
the job on your first shot.

179
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,077
You come here every day, don't you?

180
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,649
Bird-watching?

181
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,311
Oh... Yeah.

182
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,821
A lot of visitors come to
this forest on Thursdays.

183
00:14:55,928 --> 00:15:00,456
Those two young people with
that old man and you.

184
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,363
Do you like this forest?

185
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:05,796
Yeah...

186
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,067
U-Umm... What about you?

187
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,542
Me?

188
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:16,204
I'm apologizing to this forest

189
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,048
and I have been for over 60 years.

190
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,506
Haven't seen him before.

191
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:59,148
He's barely touched
my special dishes!

192
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:34,158
<i>Come on' answer today's quiz
to win fabulous prizes!</i>

193
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:40,292
<i>Our first contestant is
Mr. Weindler from Frankfurt!</i>

194
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,894
<i>Here's the prize' an RV!</i>

195
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,073
<i>Woah... It's what my family
has always wanted.</i>

196
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,036
<i>Mr. Weindler is very pleased!</i>

197
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,767
<i>It would be wonderful
to go camping in this!</i>

198
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:57,277
<i>But you'll only get it if you answer
ten questions correctly.</i>

199
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,275
<i>The first question!</i>

200
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,061
Are you planning to leave without
touching anything again?

201
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,264
You came about a week ago,
didn't you?

202
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,862
I always remember my customers,
no matter how crowded it is.

203
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,632
If you're not hungry,
at least have this soup before you leave.

204
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,843
It's on the house.

205
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,745
You look terrible.

206
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,115
Thank you.

207
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,379
This is the place.

208
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,613
I can only shoot him in this forest!

209
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,235
You saved me.

210
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:12,882
I never thought that I'd trip after walking
in this forest after all these years.

211
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,115
I must be getting old.

212
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:19,385
I don't think you have a fracture.
I've applied first aid.

213
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,019
Afterwards, go to a hospital
and have someone take a look at it.

214
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,585
Are you a doctor?

215
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,497
When I first saw you,
I thought you were a hunter.

216
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,496
But that doesn't seem to be the case.

217
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,545
I'm amazed.

218
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,415
What's wrong?

219
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:45,850
The birds.

220
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,712
They're gathering.

221
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:55,022
Long ago, there was a man on whose
shoulder wild birds would come to rest.

222
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,463
The wild birds would come and rest
on his hand when he held it out like this.

223
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,799
When he was a child, he would always
spend his time in the forest with the birds.

224
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,239
But then, the age of Hitler came.

225
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,573
The man became a member
of the police.

226
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,752
The Nationalist Socialist German
Workers Party truly believed

227
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,413
they could turn this country
into an ideal one.

228
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,483
The man received an order.

229
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,397
A vicious criminal escaped into this forest.

230
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,566
He was chosen to go after him
since he was familiar with the forest.

231
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,971
"Shoot that vicious criminal
when you find him"' they said.

232
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,972
The man chased the vicious criminal
through the forest.

233
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,079
He chased him and chased him.

234
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,877
But when he finally cornered him,

235
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:59,254
the vicious criminal was just an
ordinary foreigner you'd see anywhere.

236
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:03,589
But it didn't matter who
the foreigner was.

237
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,653
The man had no choice.

238
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,863
He carried out his orders.

239
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:30,510
Since then, the birds never came
to rest on his shoulder.

240
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,916
60 years later, he's still apologizing.

241
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,591
I'm sorry. I'm sorry"' he tells them.

242
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:47,302
But the birds never come near him.

243
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,487
Amazing.

244
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,797
It's all right.
Never again...

245
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,396
Never again will blood be spilled
in this forest again.

246
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,929
Isn't that right?
