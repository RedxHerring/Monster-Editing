1
00:00:10,598 --> 00:00:11,565
"That's good enough"?!

2
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:16,001
"That's good enough"?
What do you mean, Mr. Schuwald?

3
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:20,805
I'm calling off the investigation.

4
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:25,939
Hold on a second. I'm through
investigating Karl Neumann.

5
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:28,004
He really is your son.

6
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:30,579
I'm grateful to you.

7
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:33,545
N-No, hold on a second!

8
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:36,056
Not everything's been solved.

9
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:38,121
There still is a possibility that

10
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:40,058
Edmund Fahren, the boy
who pretended to be your son,

11
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:41,960
didn't commit suicide!

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,057
It isn't clear who was pulling
the strings behind Fahren!

13
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:48,902
Everything's been solved.

14
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:55,666
I've poured some tea, Father.

15
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:57,578
I see.

16
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:00,077
Oh, hello.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,988
Would you like some?

18
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:08,947
Oh, no. I'm fine.

19
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:13,124
Good work. Send me the bill.

20
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:16,559
The weather sure is nice.

21
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:18,356
Yes.

22
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,123
Johan's coming as well.

23
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:24,196
Ah. So Johan's coming along.

24
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:33,042
<i>He was a cold man.
Reserved and untrusting.</i>

25
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:35,747
<i>Who would have thought that
he would transform into</i>

26
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:37,945
<i>such a good-natured old man
as soon as he found his son...?</i>

27
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,679
<i>That smile...</i>

28
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:45,150
<i>I would never guess that people
call him the "Vampire of Bavaria."</i>

29
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:50,328
"Ah. So Johan's coming along."

30
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:34,767
So you're looking for this puppy?

31
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:36,329
Yes.

32
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:40,502
It seems that
my client's ex-husband took it.

33
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:46,173
Even custody disputes over puppies
can get messy.

34
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:47,514
Jeez...

35
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:51,183
Sorry, but I'm going to
have some wine.

36
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,854
Go right ahead.
Water is good enough for me.

37
00:03:55,923 --> 00:04:02,192
Your work is slow, but you don't
seem interested in alcohol.

38
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:04,923
Yes. I'm all right in that account.

39
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:10,034
That account? Is there
something else bothering you?

40
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:14,906
Well, I have some free time
so I do trivial things.

41
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:15,835
Oh?

42
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,245
I look at my personal scrapbook

43
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:22,840
of unsolved crimes from my time
as a police detective.

44
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:24,476
I see.

45
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:27,678
So how do you feel
when you look at it?

46
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:29,547
Frustrated.

47
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,885
This murder, that murder...

48
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:37,490
When I think that the culprits
are still at large...

49
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,100
I just can't see them through.

50
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:42,566
Not with my incompetence.

51
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,099
You have the skills.
But you get too desperate, Richard.

52
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,735
You get too involved in your cases.

53
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:53,937
You were annoyed that you couldn't
read the criminals' minds,

54
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:55,676
and you got frustrated.

55
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,445
So I turned to alcohol.

56
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:59,653
Yes, that's right!

57
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:02,156
Sorry to keep you waiting.

58
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,924
Ah, it's time to eat!

59
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,730
But I don't think that there's
anything wrong with that.

60
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:17,269
Looking through your scrapbook
of old cases.

61
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:20,103
I just become annoyed again.

62
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:21,839
No, you're all right now.

63
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:24,874
I want you to tell me what you think of

64
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:27,244
when you look through them
from your current point of view.

65
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:32,982
You were drunk and shot down
that young serial killer.

66
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:37,252
You're ready to face that truth
head on.

67
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:41,251
But you're still running away from
the thoughts you had

68
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:43,354
when you pulled the trigger.

69
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:51,497
You still see that boy's ghost,
don't you?

70
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,266
Yes.

71
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:59,908
When everything clears up
and is brought to light,

72
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:02,075
that ghost will disappear.

73
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:39,777
"When everything is
brought to light"' huh?

74
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,188
The "accountant murder case".

75
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:49,561
The victim, Joachim Holmer,
had a steady career.

76
00:06:50,164 --> 00:06:53,429
He wasn't the kind of person
who would make enemies.

77
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:55,599
He was stabbed to death.

78
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:57,798
There was no indication
that he was robbed.

79
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,467
The "Voice of God murder case".

80
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,711
The victims were a former
housekeeper and a chauffeur.

81
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:11,876
The message, "I heard the voice of
God"' was left at both crime scenes.

82
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:17,351
The "Dornach Company president
murder case".

83
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:21,122
Lute Gauk was one of
the wealthiest men in Bavaria.

84
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:23,925
His body was found
in Hartholz Forest.

85
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:28,934
The "Spira couple murder case"...

86
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,062
The Spiras' drowned bodies
washed up upstream

87
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,538
along the Isar River.

88
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,734
It is being investigated
as one of a series

89
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:38,142
of middle-aged couple murders.

90
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:42,583
The material witness,
a Japanese doctor, is still on the run.

91
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:45,682
Oh man...

92
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,058
The more unsolved cases I had,
the more alcohol I drank.

93
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:55,828
But it's different now.

94
00:07:57,264 --> 00:08:00,393
I see. It's as the doctor said.

95
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:04,165
So this is what it means
to think while sober...

96
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:10,701
H-Hold on a second.

97
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:12,270
Think hard!

98
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,014
Think hard.

99
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:46,773
So...

100
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,673
What did you figure out?

101
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:54,787
Well...about that.
I thought of something, but...

102
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:59,892
You saw that boy's ghost
and you lost your thoughts?

103
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:01,054
Yes.

104
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,561
There's no need to worry!

105
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:07,665
Your thoughts will
come back to you sooner or later.

106
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:16,001
What did I realize?

107
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:21,775
It was an important key
to solving one of those cases.

108
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,453
Was that just my imagination?

109
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,826
Who is it?!

110
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,896
Who is it?!

111
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:46,006
Who's following me?!

112
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,405
<i>It's the same as before.</i>

113
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:58,277
<i>Back then, I was running after him
through an alley just like this.</i>

114
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,100
I'm sorry for coming
so late at night, Doctor.

115
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,804
Well, you finally feel like
telling me everything!

116
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,576
Tell me about it.

117
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,909
Back then, I saw something
within that boy.

118
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:33,477
That's when I knew it existed
in this world.

119
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:36,083
True evil.

120
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:42,897
That's why I. ..I shot him.

121
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:49,698
All right! I'm glad you told me.
You've finally recovered!

122
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:53,067
There's still more.. .I realized.

123
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:57,577
The idea that popped in my head.

124
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:02,582
The unsolved cases I had been
working on were actually...

125
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:05,345
...a single case.

126
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:13,987
<i>Dear Dr. Gillen...</i>

127
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:18,058
<i>The other day I read the book
that you sent me,</i>

128
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:20,430
<i>"An introduction to Transcendental
Criminal Psychology."</i>

129
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:23,331
<i>Your book was
a very interesting read.</i>

130
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:28,671
<i>It pleases me to see that a student
of mine from Düsseldorf University</i>

131
00:11:28,776 --> 00:11:33,805
<i>is now a leading authority
in the field of criminal psychology.</i>

132
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:40,697
<i>That aside, regarding the interview
you conducted with</i>

133
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:43,349
<i>the serial murderer Peter Jurgens.</i>

134
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:51,423
<i>You told me that Jurgens claimed that
a friend told him to murder his victims.</i>

135
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,229
<i>My memory isn't clear,</i>

136
00:11:54,301 --> 00:12:01,503
<i>so could you tell me again
the name of Jurgens' alleged friend?</i>

137
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:09,674
<i>PS.</i>

138
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:14,981
<i>You were a very good student
in college,</i>

139
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:17,717
<i>but there was a student in your class
who was just as brilliant</i>

140
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,317
<i>and always fought you
to be top of the class.</i>

141
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:23,795
<i>He moved on to become
a neurosurgeon.</i>

142
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:25,991
<i>At any rate, it seems that
he's become a material witness</i>

143
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:27,625
<i>in a multiple homicide case.</i>

144
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:32,335
<i>I want you to tell me anything
you know about him.</i>

145
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:38,207
<i>What kind of person is he,
and where might he be right now?</i>

146
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,610
<i>This Dr. Tenma...</i>

147
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:45,481
Well, if it isn't that detective
from before!

148
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,351
Well, I'm just a private detective
right now.

149
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:52,989
I'm sorry for bringing up
a painful subject,

150
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:59,932
but may I question you once more
about the "Voice of God case"?

151
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:01,726
Of course!

152
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:04,628
It's been four years
and the police aren't

153
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:06,503
putting any more energy
into the investigation.

154
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,501
Schuwald?

155
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:15,509
Yes. I believe your mother was once
a housekeeper for the tycoon.

156
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:16,876
Yes.

157
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:19,553
But that was already
twenty years ago.

158
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:22,185
Why did she quit?

159
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:24,958
She became ill at the time.

160
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:29,156
After that, she only took jobs
close to home.

161
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,332
Could it be that she was
having problems with Mr. Schuwald?

162
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:38,501
Not at all!
My mother loved to read poems.

163
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:41,434
She said that she used to
read poems with Mr. Schuwald

164
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:43,772
when he could still see.

165
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:49,275
Oh yeah, come over here.

166
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,249
Take a look. I've kept these
in memory of my mother.

167
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:01,623
The poetry collections on this shelf

168
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:04,995
are all presents to my mother
from Mr. Schuwald.

169
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:10,267
So, the detective in charge of

170
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,965
the "Dornach Company president
murder case"

171
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,168
is now just a private detective.

172
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:17,968
You used to be
the president's secretary.

173
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,311
I'd like to ask you once more
if anyone held a grudge against him.

174
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,745
His enemies? There's not
enough time to count them all.

175
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,619
The police should have already
investigated the businesses

176
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:35,628
that went bankrupt
because of Mr. Gauk.

177
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:40,099
There's another powerful
businessman in Bavaria, isn't there?!

178
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:42,302
What was Mr. Gauk's relationship
with him?

179
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,695
Mr. Schuwald, huh?

180
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:50,234
Well, they were life-long rivals.

181
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:52,610
Did you know?

182
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:57,442
Schuwald went bankrupt twice
in the past.

183
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:02,151
His second bankruptcy was the result
of a fierce business war

184
00:15:02,222 --> 00:15:03,951
with Mr. Gauk.

185
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:07,960
In other words, Mr. Gauk
crushed Mr. Schuwald.

186
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:11,895
There were times when Mr. Schuwald
defeated the president as well.

187
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:13,900
They both hated each other?

188
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:15,502
Of course!

189
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:20,436
It was terrible if they
happened to meet at a party.

190
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:23,741
They had explosive fights.

191
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:25,206
Those two?

192
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:27,846
Yes, even though
they're both cold-hearted.

193
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:32,282
But they were the only people
they could talk to on the same level.

194
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,549
They weren't really rivals.

195
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:38,257
They were really more like friends.

196
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:05,184
Be careful!

197
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:14,117
Yeah. I knew Hans well.

198
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:19,292
He was one of the two people killed
in the "Voice of God murder case."

199
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,767
He was such a good man.
How unfortunate.

200
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:26,073
Was Hans really such a good man?

201
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,601
Yeah. He'd often treat me to a drink.

202
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,107
He used to drive for Schwald, right?

203
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:41,882
Apparently. But that was
thirty years ago.

204
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:44,550
Do you know why he was fired?

205
00:16:44,892 --> 00:16:48,260
Well, it was around the time
that Schuwald went bankrupt.

206
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:49,591
Oh...I see!

207
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,561
They never had any problems
between them, did they?

208
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,131
Listen. I'm going to say this
in honor of Hans...

209
00:16:56,603 --> 00:17:01,734
He was a good-natured man
who could get along with anyone.

210
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:03,003
Even filthy rich bastards like

211
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:05,841
that "Vampire of Bavaria"'
or poor people like us.

212
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:12,183
He often said that he was the one
who taught that tycoon how to bird-watch!

213
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:14,185
Bird-watch?

214
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:17,886
Yeah. Hans said that Schuwald
was more like a happy child

215
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,256
than a vampire when
he took him to the forest.

216
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,164
It's already been two years since then.

217
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:28,093
But still, whenever I think
of my husband...

218
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:31,503
My husband was always
a very serious man

219
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:34,041
who never did anything
to be hated by anyone.

220
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,670
But...he was killed
in such a terrible way.

221
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:39,235
I'm very sorry.

222
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:43,278
Excuse me for asking,
but I believe your husband was an...

223
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:44,243
Yes.

224
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:47,580
He lived in an orphanage
when he was younger,

225
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,679
and was shoved off
to various foster parents.

226
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:52,055
After a miserable childhood,
he became an accountant.

227
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:56,224
Mr. Schuwald asked your husband
to be his corporate accountant,

228
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:57,695
didn't he?

229
00:17:58,332 --> 00:17:59,424
Yes. Many times.

230
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:01,723
But my husband always
turned him down.

231
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:05,469
Not only was he busy with
the work he had at the time, but...

232
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:09,574
His philosophy towards money was
very different from Mr. Schuwald's.

233
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:12,469
My husband was very honest
when it came to money.

234
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:16,274
Thank you for your cooperation.

235
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:19,447
Will the culprit be caught?

236
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,187
I'll try my best.

237
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:23,747
I'll catch him!

238
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,084
Well, I'll be off.

239
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:29,320
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

240
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:34,495
Do you know how your husband
and Mr. Schuwald met?

241
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,633
Yes. He said that they met
in the forest.

242
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:39,164
The forest?

243
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,935
It was when Mr. Schuwald
could still see.

244
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:44,842
They met in the forest.

245
00:18:45,345 --> 00:18:46,835
What were they doing there?

246
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,111
They were bird-watching.

247
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:52,285
They went together
many times after that.

248
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:03,797
<i>Bird-watching.</i>

249
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:06,565
<i>Like a happy child.</i>

250
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:09,168
<i>Read together.</i>

251
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,060
<i>Friends.</i>

252
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:22,710
A-Are you all right?!

253
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:25,183
Yeah. I'm fine.
Thank you.

254
00:19:26,086 --> 00:19:27,747
What horrible driving.

255
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:32,054
It looked more like he was
trying to hit you!

256
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:40,259
Dr. Reichwein, I've collected
all the evidence.

257
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:43,928
It's as I told you before.

258
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:47,205
The many cases that troubled me
when I was a police detective...

259
00:19:48,341 --> 00:19:50,673
...all point in the same direction!

260
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:55,081
The "Voice of God murder case"!

261
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,975
The "Dornach Company president
murder case"!

262
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,187
The "accountant murder case"!

263
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:03,886
They appear to have
nothing in common.

264
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:06,985
The methods in which they were
committed were different.

265
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,693
The victims didn't have any relation
to one another.

266
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:13,230
Furthermore, they didn't have
any financial ties.

267
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:16,195
But there is something
that wasn't recorded.

268
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,571
There is something
that connects them all.

269
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:27,577
The deaths of all the victims
were used to isolate Schuwald.

270
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:33,377
There is also
another strange connection.

271
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,252
In the "Dornach Company president
murder case",

272
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:41,420
it was the man who Mr. Gauk
was supposed to meet

273
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:43,395
right before he was murdered.

274
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,095
In the "Voice of God murder case",

275
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,794
it was the god whose name
the murderer scribbled on the walls.

276
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,898
And there's the middle-aged couple
multiple homicides.

277
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:55,999
The one case that seemed
to be unrelated.

278
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,340
It was the culprit named by
the material witness,

279
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,074
the Japanese doctor.

280
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,380
They all had the same name!

281
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:06,378
Johan.

282
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:12,557
My former student,
a criminal psychologist,

283
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:16,119
was studying a murderer
who committed his crimes

284
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:17,527
on a friend's orders.

285
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:22,535
He told me in his letter.
That friend's name was also...

286
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,037
Johan!

287
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:33,168
It's a common name. It's possible that
the cases are related.

288
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:36,843
But if this is true,

289
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:40,751
he's been systematically murdering
people for the past four years.

290
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,065
The man known as Johan

291
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:46,753
is trying to force Schuwald
into complete isolation.

292
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:53,325
Margot Langer, the woman who bore
Schuwald's son conveniently died.

293
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:57,868
And the student who pretended
to be Schuwald's son.

294
00:21:57,938 --> 00:22:01,499
He also conveniently killed himself
as soon as he made his claim.

295
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:08,644
If Johan really does exist,
where is he right now?!

296
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,543
<i>I see.</i>

297
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:16,053
<i>So Johan's coming along.</i>

298
00:22:21,294 --> 00:22:24,662
<i>Johan, the weather is beautiful.</i>

299
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:26,757
<i>Yes. Very.</i>

300
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:32,973
He's right next to Schuwald!
