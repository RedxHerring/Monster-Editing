1
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,597
Your mother abandoned you!

2
00:00:14,903 --> 00:00:18,771
You were thrown away like trash
along with your drunken father!

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,400
Don't come out of
the trash dump again!

4
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:18,853
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

5
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:22,162
If you want to drink,
do it after you pay your tab.

6
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,363
If it's money...
Here. This is for today.

7
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:31,572
We don't have drinks to be bought
with money earned by children.

8
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,168
What?

9
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:34,742
Get out.

10
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:44,742
He's suspicious.

11
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,287
You mean what happened
to Mr. Conrad?

12
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:49,257
Mrs. Hillman's dog, too.
Could it be?

13
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:52,321
He doesn't have the guts
to shoot a gun.

14
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:54,520
That's right.

15
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,961
He's just a drunk coward.

16
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:08,867
Honestly...

17
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:10,606
We're supposed to
be searching, but...

18
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:14,075
Hey Merkel, let's call it a day!

19
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,074
Hey, Merkel!

20
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:32,466
I found him ! I found him!

21
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:35,766
Merkel ! Mer–

22
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,407
Merkel...

23
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:59,391
This is Laufer!
Please respond!

24
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,387
Someone !
Someone answer!

25
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:16,338
I'm also going to
take your gun.

26
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,954
<i>He doesn't have the guts
to shoot a gun.</i>

27
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,549
<i>That's right.</i>

28
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,224
<i>He's just a drunk coward.</i>

29
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:08,485
Across town, there
are countless corpses.

30
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:11,425
It's like a battlefield.

31
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:22,435
Wim...

32
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:25,913
What's wrong, Wim?

33
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,251
It's all right.
Calm down. It's me.

34
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:39,417
I-I... I...

35
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:43,020
Calm down.
Now let go of the gun.

36
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,130
I don't really remember.
I shot them, didn't I?

37
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:51,864
They were teasing me...
so I...

38
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,348
Wim, you...

39
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:11,425
It's all right. Calm down. It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

40
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,384
Calm down. Try to remember.

41
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:18,323
Who did you get this gun from?

42
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:22,026
Get a hold of yourself!

43
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,370
Laufer, I'm surprised you
got this far on that leg!

44
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:28,672
C-Call the station.

45
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:30,474
The telephone doesn't work.

46
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:33,137
M-My gun was taken away.

47
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:35,082
By someone in this town?

48
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:38,877
I don't know. He was an outsider
I've never seen before.

49
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:45,324
Anyway, apply first aid.

50
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:50,228
Is he one of you?

51
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:52,664
What are you talking about?

52
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:55,902
How many of you
have come to this town?

53
00:06:56,671 --> 00:06:58,639
What are you trying to say?

54
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,805
You've scattered quite
a few guns around.

55
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:05,877
You've even given
this child a gun.

56
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:07,707
Wim!

57
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:10,240
A gun? Did you...

58
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:12,447
"You're not trash."

59
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,547
"Don't bother with them."

60
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:17,356
"You were born for a reason."

61
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,623
You told him those things
to encourage him.

62
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:27,691
He didn't shoot the gun.
All the bullets are still in it.

63
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,901
Wim did just what
you taught him to.

64
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:39,610
Well done, Wim.

65
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:45,352
It's all right.

66
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,878
It's all right, Wim.

67
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:53,619
By the way,
this town is filled with corpses.

68
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:04,429
How many guns did you
hand out in this town?

69
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:08,738
How many people
got guns from you?!

70
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,802
Don't make me any angrier!

71
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,215
Something terrible will happen
if you make me angry.

72
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:17,785
He looked just like
our grandson.

73
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:19,653
What?

74
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:24,450
He looked just like
our dead grandson.

75
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:26,252
He?

76
00:08:27,094 --> 00:08:29,893
He knew us well.

77
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:33,164
It was as if he was
our real grandson.

78
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:34,925
Who is he?

79
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:38,603
You were writing a letter
to your dead grandson.

80
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:41,700
You were sending
him information.

81
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:43,501
Who is he?!

82
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:46,780
He's probably after me.

83
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:50,116
That's what he's after.

84
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,946
Yes.

85
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:57,386
That's right, Mr. Poppe.

86
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:01,795
No. Franz...Bonaparta...

87
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:11,397
<i>The heavy rain that continues
to fall in southern Germany</i>

88
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:14,407
<i>has caused many casualties
along the rivers in Bavaria.</i>

89
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,536
Hey, you smoke too much.

90
00:09:18,913 --> 00:09:21,041
It's all right. I've quit drinking.

91
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:23,410
You should quit smoking, too.

92
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:28,356
Dieter, what have you
been drawing all this time?

93
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:32,685
What do you think?
Does it look like him?

94
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,027
Look like whom?

95
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,688
Like Tenma.

96
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:38,964
I'm going to give that
to the police.

97
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:42,628
They don't believe you
at the crucial moments.

98
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:45,203
So I'll tell them...

99
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:50,801
"I'm talking about this man."

100
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:54,881
"This man has gone off
to hunt monsters by himself."

101
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:59,583
Tenma's going to
come back, right?

102
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:04,549
<i>Now, a report on the damage.</i>

103
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,691
<i>Due to the Elgar River
flooding,</i>

104
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,057
<i>roads have been
closed in several areas.</i>

105
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:10,359
<i>Both outbound and inbound railways
have been shut down.</i>

106
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:12,833
<i>Also, it's become
diff cult to get calls through</i>

107
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,062
<i>to areas that have
experienced power failures.</i>

108
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:17,662
This is an e-mail that
came three days ago.

109
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:24,110
After talking to Dr. Gillen, we decided
that we should show it to you.

110
00:10:24,812 --> 00:10:25,779
Please show it to me.

111
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:34,748
"To Nina..."

112
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,386
"I'll be waiting for you
in Ruhenheim."

113
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:41,154
Johan...

114
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:43,755
You think so too, huh?

115
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,463
You described what Johan is trying
to do right now as "a perfect suicide."

116
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:57,273
You said that lots of innocent people
are going to die.

117
00:10:58,546 --> 00:10:59,672
Ruhenheim...

118
00:11:00,347 --> 00:11:03,044
There is a rural village with
that name in southern Germany.

119
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:06,578
There's a possibility that
Tenma has headed there.

120
00:11:07,888 --> 00:11:08,548
I've got to go there.

121
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,321
Let me go there.

122
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,589
It really is an odd feeling.

123
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:24,065
At first, you were someone who
existed in a certain man's delusions.

124
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:29,669
Yes. You were like a character
in one of your books.

125
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:33,544
For many years,

126
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:36,584
I've carried out my investigation
by compiling objective data.

127
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:42,451
But this time, I ignored all my data
and followed that man's delusions.

128
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:46,721
As I tugged at the loose ends,
partially for fun,

129
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:48,819
I met a young man
in the Czech Republic

130
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:51,194
who visited Red Rose Mansion
very often.

131
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,259
It was your son.

132
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:58,305
This is a handwritten postcard
that was sent to him.

133
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:02,274
It's signed K. P. for Klaus Poppe,
your real name.

134
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,942
Even though I've arrived at this place
and you're right before my eyes,

135
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:09,140
it still feels odd.

136
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,147
It's as if a character from
a picture book has sprung out.

137
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:15,180
But this is reality.

138
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,894
The list of Czech refugees in
the late 80s that I looked up

139
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:23,225
included the name
Klaus Poppe.

140
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:27,563
You fled here after
the fall of the Berlin Wall.

141
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,904
What were you
trying to run from?

142
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:36,137
People like me?

143
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:43,311
511 Kinderheim was established
because of your plan.

144
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:46,251
I was created there.

145
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:50,958
Were you trying to run
from people like me?

146
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:59,833
I know what he. ..what the young man
named Johan is trying to do.

147
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:05,663
And it's happening in
this town right now.

148
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,133
Another gunshot!

149
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:14,309
There were lots of dead people
on the way to this hotel.

150
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:18,074
What's happened
to this town?!

151
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,980
Get me out of
this town already!

152
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:26,457
I can't right now.
All transportation has been cut off.

153
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:30,028
Jeez. What are you doing?!

154
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:33,431
You go out and come back and
take a shower each time you do.

155
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:38,635
The town smells of gunpowder
and blood. It's sickening.

156
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:47,304
Now calm down. I've ordered
hot tea from the front desk.

157
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:55,588
It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

158
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:59,788
Everything is going to disappear
when the rain stops.

159
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:04,194
"Disappear"? What will?

160
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,067
All the memories.

161
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:14,064
I will let you go
on two conditions.

162
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:20,778
You must go with Dr. Gillen...
And you cannot bring a gun.

163
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:23,515
I don't need a gun.

164
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,749
I'll get ready to go.

165
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:32,088
And. ..do what I told you
to do immediately.

166
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:38,429
Dieter, Eva, you Dr. Reichwein,
Mr. Schuwald, Karl and Lotte...

167
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:41,899
Everyone that knows Johan
must go into hiding.

168
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:47,139
Johan is trying to erase
all his memories.

169
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:57,447
Come on.
Try not to let Dieter see you.

170
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,787
My memories with Dieter...

171
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:07,224
My memories with you
Dr. Reichwein...

172
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:09,489
My memories with
Lotte and Karl...

173
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:11,890
My memories with
the Fortners...

174
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,758
My memories with
Tenma...

175
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,237
I have memories
I don't want to forget.

176
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:22,970
Even if I have memories
I want to erase...

177
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:27,575
Johan is. ..
Johan's memories...

178
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:30,450
...shouldn't be erased.

179
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,067
A police officer...

180
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:51,527
His gun's been taken.

181
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,534
Don't move from that spot!

182
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:10,958
Save this town...

183
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:13,550
Who shot you?

184
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:16,322
There have been gunfights
all over town.

185
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:22,499
First.. .several armed men
came in.

186
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:29,167
Before I knew it, the townspeople had
guns and were shooting at each other.

187
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:34,246
I've got to go and call for help.

188
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:38,876
I've got to at least
save the children.

189
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:42,755
Help.

190
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:51,724
Johan...

191
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:58,128
The first time I heard
that name was in 1995,

192
00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:00,503
in the statement of
a certain neurosurgeon.

193
00:17:01,174 --> 00:17:02,335
Dr. Tenma.

194
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:07,580
You admit that your deduction
is now incorrect?

195
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:09,375
No.

196
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:12,983
He's still a key witness to me.

197
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,846
Johan is still just a fabrication.

198
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:24,394
"Fabrication"... I was obsessed by
this term throughout my vacation.

199
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:29,395
What does a person who actually
exists have to do to become a fabrication?

200
00:17:30,504 --> 00:17:31,801
The answer is simple.

201
00:17:32,472 --> 00:17:38,138
Erase everyone who knows him and
everyone who knows about his past.

202
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:43,649
In the end, Mr. Bonaparta, it'll be just
like the ending of your picture book.

203
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,688
"At last he had
found a name"'

204
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:51,622
"but there was no longer anyone
around to call him by it."

205
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:55,521
"Because Johan is such
a wonderful name."

206
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,268
If that's what's going to
happen to this town.

207
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:08,074
That's what I'd do if I were Johan.
I'm also a fabrication.

208
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:12,576
I'm not Newmeyer, the man
whose name is written in the ledger,

209
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:15,047
nor am I Wolfgang Grimmer.

210
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:17,948
I am nobody.

211
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:26,390
I'll disappear with the person who
took my memories and my name.

212
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:30,122
I've been waiting.

213
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:35,424
I've been waiting here
for my verdict.

214
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:44,406
I'm not afraid to die. But I don't
know how to make amends.

215
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:48,812
But I will accept everything...

216
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,482
You've been waiting?

217
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:54,250
You're not afraid to die?

218
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,325
Do you know how terrible
the things you did were?!

219
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:04,227
Do you know what it means to destroy
the root of good and evil in a person?!

220
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:09,096
Do you know what happens when
you awaken the monster within people?!

221
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:15,933
People... People should think
that meals taste good.

222
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:18,968
They should look forward
to picnics on weekends.

223
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:22,514
They should think that a beer
after work tastes good.

224
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,077
People should...
People should...

225
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:32,455
feel sad from the bottom of
their hearts if their child dies.

226
00:19:34,194 --> 00:19:35,889
I won't let you die.

227
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,126
I'm going to get you
out of this town safely

228
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,394
and have you make
everything public.

229
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:45,037
You're going to
reveal to the world

230
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:47,130
the identity of the monster
that you awakened.

231
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,609
Until then, I'll protect you.

232
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:59,181
Where is Johan?

233
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,345
I-I don't know.

234
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:07,759
Someone's behind this massacre.
Where is he?

235
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:10,221
I-I don't know.

236
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:14,100
Where is he?

237
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,660
Another gunshot...

238
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,042
Is someone here?

239
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,646
Can you see me?

240
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:36,749
Look. I'm not holding anything.

241
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:47,626
It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

242
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:55,306
I've come to help you. Relax.

243
00:20:57,944 --> 00:21:00,072
It's dangerous here, got it?

244
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:01,738
Get out of town.

245
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:08,686
Don't cry! I'll take you to
the path through the woods.

246
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:09,849
You can run, can't you?!

247
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:16,862
Th-There's a man giving orders
from the Hotel Bergbach.

248
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:19,132
I see.

249
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:23,331
Even so,
I only have this single gun.

250
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:26,473
These two were outside.

251
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:28,574
Sorry.

252
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:32,001
This all happened because
I won the lottery.

253
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:38,543
If only we had informed the police
earlier that we found Conrad's body...

254
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,547
Before the town
got this crazy...

255
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:46,757
You bought these?

256
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:50,193
I-I haven't fired a single shot!
It's true!

257
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,798
Let me borrow this one
and this one.

258
00:21:56,803 --> 00:21:58,828
You protect this hotel.

259
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,665
What about you?

260
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:03,006
Even ordinary citizens
are carrying guns.

261
00:22:03,443 --> 00:22:05,969
I'm a detective.
I can tell the difference.

262
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:09,209
Oh yeah. Mr. Grimmer...

263
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:14,151
Let me buy you a beer
when this job is over.

264
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:17,582
Yes, please...a good beer.

265
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:22,488
Now!

266
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:25,791
Run!

267
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:27,524
You have to survive!
