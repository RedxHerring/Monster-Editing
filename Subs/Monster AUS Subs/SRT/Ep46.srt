1
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:10,427
CHECK PLACEMENT Honestly.
This has turned into an awful case!

2
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:13,064
Is there any new information?

3
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:17,694
Yes. The police said that they're going
to hold a press conference at 3 PM.

4
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:19,897
We're going directly
to the Prague station!

5
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:23,270
This is the first time in my career
that I've seen a case like this.

6
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:32,553
Have you been examining documents
there since last night?

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,384
Oh, hello. Thankfully,
I found the article I was looking for.

8
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,419
Ah. That's good.

9
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,394
Oh. Wait a second.

10
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,293
I'm busy right now.

11
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,098
Umm.. .
About Mr. X in this article...

12
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:51,796
Mr. X?

13
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:55,377
Yes. An article from
three years ago titled,

14
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:58,003
"The Truth About the Former
Czechoslovakian Secret Police"...

15
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:01,513
Oh. That's the article describing how,
after the Wall fell,

16
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:06,497
the German right-wingers and the
former Czechoslovakian secret police

17
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:10,219
suddenly extended their influence
and are behind crime syndicates now.

18
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:12,253
I wrote this one.

19
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:14,094
Really?

20
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:15,728
Could you introduce me to Mr. X,

21
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:19,859
the former Czechoslovakian secret
police agent who was interviewed?

22
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:23,933
You said that you were a special
correspondent from Japan, right?

23
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:28,241
What do you want to
find out from Mr. X?

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,408
O-Oh, well...

25
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:34,237
I was thinking of finding out
how abductions,

26
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:37,046
imprisonment and other things they
did were done here during the Cold War.

27
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,685
They're pretty scary.

28
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:40,479
Huh?

29
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:44,122
I risked my life to
do that interview.

30
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:46,493
They're still scary.

31
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:49,496
Thanks to them,
our world is in an uproar!

32
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:50,223
Huh?

33
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:53,727
What? You don't know about
the incident with Detective Suk?

34
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:56,264
Are you really
a special correspondent?

35
00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:57,464
Well...

36
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:59,603
You said that you don't
know any Czech,

37
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:02,507
but if you're investigating
the secret police agents,

38
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:04,636
you should at least
follow the big headlines.

39
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:08,038
Here's our newspaper.
You can read German, can't you?

40
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:11,742
Suk, a young detective
from the Prague station,

41
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,288
ran away after shooting two detectives
from a special investigative team

42
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:16,357
that was dispatched
from the main station.

43
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:21,551
Inspector Zeman's murder is
what exposed the dark connection

44
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,724
between the former secret police
and the current Czech force.

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,100
Furthermore, it was Suk who revealed
that the Prague station chief

46
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,867
and two detectives were involved
with the secret police.

47
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:35,001
Someone conveniently
poisoned those three.

48
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:37,574
Suk was commended.

49
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:41,943
But the special investigative team
was watching over Suk.

50
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:48,455
However, Suk wound up killing the
two detectives who were watching him.

51
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:53,122
A promising elite detective...

52
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:54,287
Hm?

53
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,964
Once did a great deed...

54
00:02:57,665 --> 00:02:59,463
What are you mumbling about?

55
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:07,808
Three superiors poisoned to death...
Whisky Bonbons... Muscle relaxant...

56
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:11,645
Johan...

57
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:50,477
Excuse me.
Is Jan Suk's mother here?

58
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:52,908
Are you with the police?

59
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:54,307
No.

60
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:01,850
Room 409.

61
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,050
Thank you.

62
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:04,491
Umm...

63
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:07,285
I don't think meeting her will
be of any help to you.

64
00:05:27,448 --> 00:05:29,815
Are you Jan Suk's mother?

65
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,486
Jan?

66
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,560
Jan.. .you came.

67
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:40,624
No, I'm...

68
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:43,453
I'm glad you could come, Jan.

69
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:46,896
Come closer and let me
see your face, Jan.

70
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:50,297
You should lie down.

71
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,136
Oh...Jan.

72
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:56,571
Did you receive any phone calls
or letters from your son?

73
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:03,773
Listen... Katrina in the next room,
won't give me back my stuffed animal.

74
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:08,148
It's the precious stuffed animal
that Aunt Mary gave me.

75
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,253
Your son is...

76
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:16,756
Your son is innocent.

77
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:24,665
I'll be going now.

78
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,107
You...

79
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:33,103
Jan. .. Were you
playing there again?

80
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:37,679
You always play
detective there.

81
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:41,546
What place are
you talking about?

82
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:46,717
You might think it's a hideout,
but I know about it.

83
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:49,792
The abandoned building
on Bruno Street.

84
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:52,858
You found out about it?

85
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:56,470
Yes. I did.

86
00:06:58,005 --> 00:06:58,631
See you later.

87
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:03,767
Don't get hurt.
Be back by dinner.

88
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:17,984
Once upon a time, in a land far away,
there lived a nameless monster.

89
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:26,156
The monster was dying
to have a name.

90
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:37,340
<i>Once upon a time, in a land far away,
there lived a nameless monster.</i>

91
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,991
I bought food and a newspaper.
You've leapt to stardom.

92
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:57,660
Do you suppose anyone has noticed
the cassette tape and research paper

93
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:00,429
from the safe deposit box
that I sent to my mother?

94
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:05,872
Who knows? Well, it's safer than
if we had them with us.

95
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:10,235
But upon reading
all these articles,

96
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:13,178
your incident is a lot
like that other incident.

97
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:15,382
"That other incident"?

98
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,281
It happened ten years ago
in Düsseldorf, Germany.

99
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,551
The director of a hospital
and two doctors

100
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,387
died from eating
poisoned candy.

101
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:28,118
The culprit was
a promising young surgeon.

102
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:29,896
What happened to him?

103
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:34,297
He's currently on the run,
trying to prove his innocence.

104
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:45,441
You're still all right.
You have me as your witness.

105
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:49,882
You passed by her
on the stairs of my flat.

106
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:52,978
Yeah. The blonde beauty.

107
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:57,516
Even if that woman is the true murderer,
we're finished if we can't find her!

108
00:08:58,092 --> 00:08:58,718
Suk...

109
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:01,355
Are you saying that we should
just keep running around?!

110
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:05,699
Why is this happening to me?!
What did I do?

111
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:06,833
Calm down.

112
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:11,303
Are you saying that I should just
disappear off the face of the earth?!

113
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:12,406
Calm down!

114
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:16,341
Calm down! I told you to
believe in yourself, right?

115
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:19,975
I told you that, in the end,
all you can believe in is yourself.

116
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:26,344
All right. That's a good boy.

117
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,678
Now, let's eat.

118
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:32,225
This room...

119
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,887
I used to play detective
in this room when I was little.

120
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,997
That was the police
detective's desk.

121
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,169
I'm surprised that
it's remained as it was.

122
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:52,977
I gave orders to everyone from here
just like the TV dramas.

123
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:54,974
Gentlemen...

124
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,180
This case is difficult,
but I want you to conduct

125
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:59,083
the investigation to
the best of your abilities.

126
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:04,281
In the name of justice,
we mustn't let evil spread.

127
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:09,190
How nostalgic.

128
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,097
Suk!

129
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,966
Suk!

130
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:22,902
Suk...

131
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:31,885
We're surrounded.

132
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:36,652
Get a hold of yourself, Suk!

133
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:40,255
It's dangerous near the window.
Get behind the desk!

134
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:41,886
I-I can't go on.

135
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:45,158
Get a hold of yourself!
Who shot at us?!

136
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,297
Was it the Czechoslovakian
secret police?

137
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:53,264
Where are they
shooting from?!

138
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:57,907
It's all right, Suk.
They missed any vital spots.

139
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:00,038
I'm going to borrow your gun.

140
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:10,783
The tape.

141
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:32,405
Suk!

142
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:36,175
Suk...

143
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,147
Hold on.
I'm coming for you right now!

144
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:42,956
They're missing vital spots
on purpose.

145
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:46,619
The tape.

146
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,660
We don't have it here!

147
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:52,459
They can see us
from the window.

148
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:57,668
Mr. Grimmer!

149
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,867
I'm here. I'm right here, Suk!

150
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:03,702
I'm going to save you now.

151
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:17,857
It hurts. It hurts!

152
00:12:18,892 --> 00:12:20,656
All right. There, there...

153
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:22,696
It's all over.

154
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:24,764
Be quiet!

155
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:28,435
Mr. Grimmer.

156
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:30,270
Don't talk.

157
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:36,434
I-If at least you...
If at least you...escape...

158
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,877
Don't be foolish!

159
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:45,752
From above...

160
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:53,253
Czech. ..
What are they saying?

161
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:06,532
The tape!

162
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:15,579
It hurts!

163
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:35,096
I don't want to die.

164
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,744
Can you speak German?

165
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:29,255
Just a little.

166
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:31,416
What are you doing here?

167
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,658
W-Who are you?!

168
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:37,326
Answer my question.
What are you doing?

169
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:40,460
O-Okay.
We're already finished.

170
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:44,027
We all charged into that building.

171
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:48,031
The young detective and the thin man
have already been taken care of.

172
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:51,745
I was too late.

173
00:15:10,497 --> 00:15:11,464
It's quiet.

174
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,581
You're that man.

175
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:06,379
The Magnificent Steiner...

176
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:08,288
Mr. Grimmer?

177
00:16:09,723 --> 00:16:14,126
The Magnificent Steiner's
done it again.

178
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,197
Mr. Grimmer!

179
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:19,327
Hi, Doctor.

180
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,728
You finally came.

181
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:24,636
Save him.

182
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:32,842
He's a good guy.
Please save him.

183
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:36,143
There are a lot of
other patients as well.

184
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,987
What in the world is this?

185
00:16:45,726 --> 00:16:47,160
It was probably me.

186
00:16:50,397 --> 00:16:54,561
My other self inside me.

187
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:03,138
I'm...from 511 Kinderheim.

188
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,180
<i>The Magnificent Steiner!</i>

189
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:15,345
<i>Hey everyone, are you gathered
around the television?!</i>

190
00:17:15,822 --> 00:17:18,314
<i>I wonder what kind of adventures
are waiting for us today!</i>

191
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:22,561
<i>If you're in danger,
call out my name!</i>

192
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:26,133
<i>I'll come to save you
anytime, anywhere!</i>

193
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,267
<i>Steiner,
the invincible super man!</i>

194
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:34,967
<i>He doesn't abide by evil.
His name is the Magnificent Steiner!</i>

195
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:47,582
I was glued to the TV when I watched
the Magnificent Steiner in action.

196
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:52,159
The main character was
a weak young man.

197
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:56,588
He'd always be cornered by
the bad guys at a critical moment.

198
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:00,062
But when he
regained consciousness,

199
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,898
he'd find the bad guys defeated
by the Magnificent Steiner.

200
00:18:07,874 --> 00:18:09,308
Without my realizing it,

201
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:12,573
the Magnificent Steiner
started coming out for real.

202
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,649
He'd appear whenever I was in
danger and he'd defeat the bad guys.

203
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:24,380
All I remember about
when I was little was watching

204
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,187
the Magnificent Steiner on TV.

205
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:28,094
That's it.

206
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,525
All of my other memories
were taken away

207
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,092
by 511 Kinderheim.

208
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:38,266
All of them.

209
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:46,040
What nonsense. This doesn't
have anything to do with you.

210
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,815
All right.
I've applied minimal first aid.

211
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:52,286
Will Suk. ..
Will he be all right?

212
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,482
All of the bullets
passed though him.

213
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:58,053
But the wound that runs
from the auxiliary artery

214
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,116
to the brachial artery
is serious.

215
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:03,719
I've applied enough pressure
by hand to stop the bleeding.

216
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:06,856
This is all I can do for now.

217
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,327
We have to get him to
a hospital as soon as possible!

218
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:13,473
Mr. Grimmer.

219
00:19:14,508 --> 00:19:22,381
You say that 511 Kinderheim doesn't
involve me. But it does involve me.

220
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,983
Now, let's call an ambulance.

221
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:33,123
There are three men here!

222
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:34,551
We need another ambulance.

223
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:35,720
Prepare another one
immediately!

224
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:37,953
How are the injured?!

225
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:40,060
We need to hurry! But...

226
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:41,334
What's wrong?

227
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,966
All of them have
received first aid!

228
00:19:44,137 --> 00:19:45,366
And proper first aid at that!

229
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:48,198
Proper first aid?!

230
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,017
The news is on.

231
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,044
What are they saying?

232
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,845
It's in Czech, so I don't know.

233
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:04,985
But I found out the name of
the hospital where they're being kept.

234
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:08,026
Jakuba Zimy Memorial Hospital.

235
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:12,029
The police are probably
going to arrest Suk.

236
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,132
But he's...

237
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:16,459
He's innocent, right?

238
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:18,797
Yeah.

239
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,808
If I go and testify...

240
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:28,179
Dr. Tenma, why were you...

241
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:30,543
Anyway, about what
you were saying earlier...

242
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:35,179
Could you tell me
about 511 Kinderheim?

243
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:39,993
Actually, I don't really
remember it.

244
00:20:45,031 --> 00:20:49,559
I can't remember.
I can only remember fragments.

245
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:57,771
A dark passage...

246
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:00,469
A stain on the ceiling...

247
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:03,481
The sound of a squeaky door...

248
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:07,053
A musty bed...

249
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:15,420
My memories become lucid from
around the time when I was released.

250
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:19,896
Someone said that
I was 14 years old.

251
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:27,097
Now that I think of it, I was enrolled in
a strange school and given a name.

252
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:31,035
Wolfgang Grimmer.

253
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:37,640
My home was in
an incredibly artificial town.

254
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:41,852
We weren't allowed to
go outside of that area.

255
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,418
I had a father figure.
I had a mother figure.

256
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:56,028
I was taught some languages.
Russian, English, Spanish, French...

257
00:21:57,037 --> 00:21:58,562
Spy...training?

258
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:04,534
What do you think was
the most difficult thing to learn?

259
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,743
Learning how to smile.

260
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:14,651
Now then, we've got to go
to the hospital Suk's in.

261
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:16,856
Mr. Grimmer...

262
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:18,519
I saw the newspaper.

263
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,622
You're wanted as
an important witness.

264
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:25,690
I'm the only one who
can prove Suk's innocence.
