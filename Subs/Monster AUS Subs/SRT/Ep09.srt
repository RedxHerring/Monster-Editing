1
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:19,097
It looks like another scorcher today.

2
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:22,303
Hey, it's summer,
yet you're all bundled up.

3
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,605
Aren't you hot?

4
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:27,809
What's that?
That paper's three days old.

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,117
They say this time a middle-aged couple
in Verden was killed.

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,682
I hear the killer is a doctor...

7
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:38,924
Oh, yeah... You said you're going
to Verden, didn't you?

8
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:40,926
You know someone there?

9
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:45,299
Yeah... I don't know if I can
meet up with him or not, but...

10
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:47,632
I have to go there...

11
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:03,666
You got your start
in the French Foreign Legion.

12
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:09,271
After going off on your own, you joined
the fighting in Nicaragua in 1979.

13
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:15,242
From 1981 to 1984 you aided
the Afghan rebel guerillas...

14
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:20,949
In 1987, you played a central role
in the Mossad's secret operation

15
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:23,184
to assassinate Islamic extremists.

16
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:30,460
What a brilliant fighting record,
Hugo Bernhardt...

17
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:38,168
Since a mercenary such as you
is sponsoring this seminar,

18
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,073
I'm sure you must have some
outstanding students graduating...

19
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:48,826
It might be a good idea to send
our young ones to attend your lectures

20
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,909
and have you whip them into shape.

21
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,016
Yes, well...

22
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:56,317
incidentally...

23
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:02,023
Was this man outstanding?
I believe he showed up

24
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:04,827
at your training grounds
about five months ago.

25
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:09,070
He is brilliant with a scalpel...

26
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,162
but did he show an aptitude
with a pistol?

27
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:18,472
I have no wish to speak
about my students...

28
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:21,676
I see.

29
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,216
Have you ever learned
to shoot a gun?

30
00:04:58,653 --> 00:04:59,620
No...

31
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,250
So you're self-taught...

32
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,657
No...

33
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,021
I've never shot a gun before...

34
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:08,562
Not once?

35
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:12,958
No... I know I'm asking
for the impossible, but...

36
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:15,332
I have no choice
but to ask you for help.

37
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:19,735
Anyway, anyone
who comes here is asked

38
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:21,775
to forget all he's learned about guns.

39
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,178
But...

40
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:28,574
I've never had anyone
who'd never shot a gun before.

41
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,116
Jump rope...

42
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:07,865
Regardless of your experience,
this is where everyone starts.

43
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:08,947
Just like that child...

44
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:22,058
Don't just stand there!

45
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,137
Get busy!

46
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:25,430
Y-Yes, sir!

47
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:37,985
Faster.

48
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:42,556
Faster!

49
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,093
Watch your balance! Your balance!

50
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,630
Faster!

51
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,341
Faster!

52
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:35,939
I just can't do it as well as you do...

53
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:45,645
Do you always keep an eye
on the trainees for the trainer?

54
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:52,582
Okay, okay, you needn't glare at me
that way. I'll do it.

55
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:56,759
I must do it.

56
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:12,446
Oh, a brambling...

57
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,809
I wonder if it's looking for food
for its chicks.

58
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,727
Are you so exhausted that
you've lost your appetite?

59
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:07,123
Huh? Yes...

60
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:09,935
Eating is part of your training.

61
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:12,639
Yes, sir...

62
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:40,533
Is she your child...or, your grandchild?

63
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,269
No...

64
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:49,177
That child's mother
was shot and killed by me.

65
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:54,944
Right before her eyes...in Myanmar...

66
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:03,479
When I ran into a hut in the jungles
for shelter, they were there.

67
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:18,061
The mother was holding a gun

68
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:20,617
If I'd been a fraction
of a second slower,

69
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:22,109
I'd have been shot dead.

70
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:26,013
And that's why
I brought that child here.

71
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:33,118
Since she began living with me,
that child has never smiled.

72
00:10:34,255 --> 00:10:38,419
She'll probably die hating me...

73
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,494
When you have a gun,
that sort of thing happens.

74
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,928
If you don't like it, you're better off
never picking up a gun.

75
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:57,430
What's that?

76
00:12:58,065 --> 00:13:01,330
Something smells nice...
It smells like daphne blossoms...

77
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:29,496
Thanks...

78
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:44,511
That's enough.

79
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:47,009
Huh? Then...?

80
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:49,610
It's time for some running.

81
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:53,219
Oh, I see...

82
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:56,221
When you're done running,
come to the low ground in the back.

83
00:13:56,557 --> 00:13:57,524
Huh?

84
00:13:57,658 --> 00:13:58,625
Low ground...?

85
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,885
The firing range.

86
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:02,929
Firing range...

87
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:09,430
Remember, twice...

88
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:13,337
Whenever you shoot your gun,
pull the trigger twice.

89
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:16,486
By pulling the trigger twice,
you raise the probability

90
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,875
that you'll get your target.

91
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:23,882
If you can't do that,
consider yourself dead.

92
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,633
What is this?

93
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:20,969
You're always preparing meals for me,

94
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:23,634
so today I decided to make you
some Japanese food.

95
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:27,574
This is called "nikujaga."
I hope you'll like it.

96
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,976
Those are chopsticks.
They're carved out of wood.

97
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,987
I thought they would enhance
the Japanese feel of the dish.

98
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:50,194
You're good...

99
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,204
You use those chopsticks well.

100
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,246
Once more!

101
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,383
Aim!

102
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:39,786
Do it again!

103
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:43,389
Aim!

104
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:26,466
What's wrong?

105
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:37,068
Oh, it's a brambling chick.
I guess it fell out of its nest.

106
00:17:38,178 --> 00:17:39,475
Oh...no, no!

107
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:40,774
You have to return it to its nest!

108
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:42,872
That chick is going to die!

109
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:46,885
It's very difficult to raise it
away from its nest.

110
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,886
It's rare that you
can do it successfully.

111
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,691
Let's return it to its nest...
to its mother.

112
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,468
Three seconds!

113
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:37,568
Everything is determined
in three seconds!

114
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:41,873
If there's even an instant of hesitation,
the one killed will be you.

115
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:52,151
So...

116
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:55,587
How was his performance record
when he finished the course?

117
00:18:56,523 --> 00:19:00,391
Technically, he had a perfect score,
and his physical condition also improved.

118
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:05,723
His concentration
was phenomenal. However...

119
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:07,834
However?

120
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:10,899
Being able to shoot a person
is another issue altogether.

121
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:12,438
Oh?

122
00:19:12,873 --> 00:19:18,710
Whether he's able to shoot
his first person will determine

123
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,407
whether he will or won't be able to
use his gun.

124
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:25,446
I see... I wonder which way he'll go...

125
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:32,550
Well, never mind about that.
Do you have any idea where he went?

126
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:40,864
I'd like you to tell me if you do know...

127
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:56,774
<i>Thank you for everything,
these five months...</i>

128
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,777
<i>Enclosed is the rest of my tuition.</i>

129
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,451
<i>And please help yourself
to the nikujaga.</i>

130
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,589
<i>You have my sincere thanks.</i>

131
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:21,374
Jeez...

132
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:35,788
Damn...

133
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:48,701
She laughed...

134
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,407
How about it? You do know where
he went, don't you?

135
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:05,480
I can't tell you that.

136
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:14,257
That's fine... You may leave.

137
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,467
This way.
