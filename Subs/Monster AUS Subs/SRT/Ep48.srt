1
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:11,529
What's wrong, Nina?

2
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:16,931
Dragged down these steps
and taken away...

3
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:18,098
Who was?

4
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:21,465
Big brother?

5
00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:27,740
He was called
"the Man from Red Rose Mansion."

6
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:29,409
What was that man's name?!

7
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:31,984
Franz Bonaparta.

8
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:35,046
Franz. .. Bonaparta...

9
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:41,185
But I don't know if it was his
real name. He used a pseudonym.

10
00:00:42,096 --> 00:00:43,063
A pseudonym?

11
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,899
He also wrote picture books.

12
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:53,598
I ... I was reading
a picture book in here.

13
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,706
The door opened.

14
00:00:57,111 --> 00:00:58,601
Someone came back.

15
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,077
Picture book?

16
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:07,887
Yes. It was a strange picture book.

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,884
It was called,
<i>The Nameless Monster.</i>

18
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,625
There's nothing here, Nina.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,433
What's with this memory?

20
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:25,802
I was reading
a picture book here.

21
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:31,607
But the one who opened the door
and came back.. .was me.

22
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:43,988
I was greeting myself?

23
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:50,487
<i>Welcome home.</i>

24
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:22,756
Jan Suk's mother?

25
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:27,322
Oh, Mrs. Suk is in room 409.

26
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:35,426
Her memory comes and goes.
I wonder how she is today.

27
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,521
Jan? Jan, is that you?

28
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:03,523
No.

29
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:09,169
Oh. What a beautiful girl.
Are you one of Jan's friends?

30
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:10,697
Yes.

31
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:13,201
What beautiful flowers.

32
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:15,901
I'll put them there.

33
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:19,878
Make sure that Auntie Olga
can't take it.

34
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:24,381
Auntie Olga is always
taking my things.

35
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:28,553
Just yesterday she
took away my doll.

36
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:31,123
She's mean, isn't she?

37
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:35,187
But she passed away over
ten years ago, didn't she?

38
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,094
Oh. That's right.
I'm surprised you know.

39
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,263
I've heard a lot from Jan.

40
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:46,172
I see. Where's Jan?
Is he still at school?

41
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:47,233
No.

42
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:48,907
Oh, that's right.

43
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,141
He already graduated...
and became a detective.

44
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:56,715
It's all right. Jan's safe.
There's no need to worry.

45
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:03,084
You have very kind eyes.

46
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,523
Tell me anything.
Whatever you remember.

47
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:14,391
Well... Katrina, in the next room,
is very fashionable. And...

48
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:20,540
Oh, how fun.

49
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,207
It's been a while since
I had this much fun.

50
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:24,878
That's good.

51
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,115
I must thank you in some way.

52
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:29,716
You don't need to thank me.

53
00:05:30,384 --> 00:05:35,254
I just wanted you to show me
what Jan entrusted to you.

54
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,383
Entrusted to me?

55
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:39,687
The cassette tape.

56
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:42,754
Oh. That's over there.

57
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:58,739
I never would have thought that
you would leave it with Suk's mother.

58
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:04,848
I'll wait here while you fetch
the cassette tape and the data.

59
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,151
Just forget business.
That's our promise.

60
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,785
Let's go, Doctor Tenma.

61
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:25,433
I'm sorry I said that
you weren't involved.

62
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:31,071
I don't know what to say
about that story you told me,

63
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:33,239
about what happened
ten years ago.

64
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:38,095
But this cassette tape
may be a clue

65
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:42,147
to help us reveal the whole story
and prove your innocence.

66
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:45,218
You too, Mr. Grimmer.

67
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:52,163
Yes, I was investigating the story
behind 511 Kinderheim.

68
00:06:53,467 --> 00:07:00,066
But my life won't change
even if I learn everything.

69
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:08,573
You want to see
Mr. Suk's mother?

70
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:11,750
She's in a very
good mood today.

71
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,946
Thank you.

72
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:18,452
It seems she enjoyed talking
to the person that just visited her.

73
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:19,953
Visited her?

74
00:07:20,494 --> 00:07:21,120
Who was it?!

75
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:25,526
Who knows?
A beautiful, long-haired blonde...

76
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:29,429
The tape!

77
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:45,142
You came. I heard that
you would come shortly.

78
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:46,779
Where's the tape?

79
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:51,984
The tape.. .is right here.

80
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:56,621
How is Jan?

81
00:07:57,932 --> 00:07:59,559
Right now... He's...

82
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:02,863
Take me to the hospital
where Jan is.

83
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,896
Huh?

84
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:07,431
Something terrible
happened to Jan, right?

85
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:12,735
My mind is very
clear right now.

86
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:15,739
That person who came earlier
reawakened me.

87
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:18,281
But it might just be for today.

88
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,381
Let me see Jan!

89
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:27,726
I'll take you. ..to the hospital
where Jan Suk is.

90
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:41,775
Mr. Grimmer...

91
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,745
I'm done with talking
to the secret police.

92
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:54,955
Mom...

93
00:08:56,824 --> 00:09:00,556
Jan. ..why didn't you call me?

94
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:05,257
This is nothing, Mom.

95
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:09,726
You tried to keep me from worrying
about you, didn't you?

96
00:09:10,304 --> 00:09:11,931
Just like the last time.

97
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:14,065
Last time?

98
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:18,539
When you were nine,
you fell from a tree, remember?

99
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:25,245
I was so worried, but you
acted as if nothing was wrong.

100
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,045
You had a terrible sprain.

101
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:37,755
Oh, Lord.. .
Don't let me forget him.

102
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,501
Jan is my child. Even if many things
disappear from my memory...

103
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:49,036
Please Lord.. .
Don't let me forget about Jan.

104
00:09:57,818 --> 00:10:03,154
<i>Let's go back.
What are you most afraid of?</i>

105
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:07,992
<i>The monster inside me
is getting bigger.</i>

106
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,563
<i>Munch-munch, chomp-chomp,
gobble-gobble, gulp!</i>

107
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:18,664
<i>Munch-munch, chomp-chomp,
gobble-gobble, gulp!</i>

108
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:27,445
That's enough.
I don't want to hear anymore.

109
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:31,082
No, you have to.

110
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,480
Your nephew you sent
to 511 Kinderheim,

111
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:38,581
is the same as this child, who
has been drugged and interrogated.

112
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:43,163
You should know what was
done to your nephew.

113
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:46,556
That's as much as
I listened to the other day.

114
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:51,961
We have to hear
what comes next.

115
00:10:55,776 --> 00:11:03,581
<i>The thing I'm afraid of the most...
That would be forgetting Anna.</i>

116
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:10,153
<i>Everyday my memories fade
because of those strange lessons.</i>

117
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:15,095
<i>Please.. .
Don't make me forget Anna.</i>

118
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:20,530
<i>Anna and I are
the only ones in this world.</i>

119
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:22,897
<i>Just this memory.</i>

120
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:24,864
<i>Please.</i>

121
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:27,633
<i>Please.</i>

122
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:34,774
<i>That's all I can let you hear.</i>

123
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:38,083
What's this?!
It's a young man's voice.

124
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:41,647
Did he erase
the old recording?

125
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:43,957
<i>I finally figured it out.</i>

126
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:46,822
And record something new?

127
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:50,795
<i>I figured it out by
listening to this tape.</i>

128
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:55,098
Did the person who came
to meet Suk's mother tape it?

129
00:11:56,503 --> 00:11:57,834
Doctor Tenma?

130
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,802
It's Johan's current voice.

131
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:12,177
<i>I finally figured out where
I should go, Doctor Tenma.</i>

132
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:18,483
He took a vacation?

133
00:12:18,826 --> 00:12:21,921
The Inspector?
He's so dedicated to the job.

134
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:23,154
I can't believe it!

135
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:26,564
I hear it's his first long-term leave
since he joined the force!

136
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:30,996
Well... Lately,
he hasn't been very busy.

137
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:35,634
He was among the BKA elite,
but he went too far.

138
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:37,905
He doesn't know his limits.

139
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:41,847
I hear his wife and daughter ran away
from him because of that.

140
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:44,984
So where's the Inspector
going on vacation?

141
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,378
He said to Prague in the Czech
Republic. But does he know how to rest?

142
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,150
What will you have?

143
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:29,722
Coffee.

144
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:31,023
Okay.

145
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,360
No, I'm on vacation now.

146
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,696
A beer.

147
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:50,105
What kind of beer is this?

148
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:52,747
Prazdroj, a local beer.

149
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:15,667
Do you think that the public will accept
an investigation report like this?!

150
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,538
We don't know
where Detective Suk is!

151
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:21,710
And even the former Czechoslovakian
secret police are involved.

152
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:24,446
We can't announce
such half-assed findings!

153
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:25,949
The media will be all over it!

154
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:30,385
B-But since all those who
were involved have died.

155
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,223
With the situation
we are in right now,

156
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:37,355
we don't have the luxury of
laying blame on the dead.

157
00:14:37,531 --> 00:14:38,589
Y-Yes, sir.

158
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:44,170
Now continue the investigation.
And find out where Suk is!

159
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:45,338
Immediately!

160
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,431
Yes, sir.

161
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,675
Excuse me.

162
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:52,440
Umm... Chief, there's someone
who wants to see you.

163
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:55,610
I won't meet anyone
without an appointment.

164
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:58,182
Besides, now is not the time!

165
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,681
But... Umm... Oh...

166
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:06,552
Y-You're...

167
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:13,991
Well, this is a surprise,
Inspector Lunge!

168
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:17,836
It's the first time we've met since
the Interpol meeting two years ago.

169
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:23,473
The lecture you gave at the sectional
meeting was very interesting!

170
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:26,446
I'm sorry to come so suddenly
at such a busy time.

171
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:30,247
Not at all. I never expected you
to come here on your vacation.

172
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:32,283
I'm jealous.

173
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,946
I can't take a vacation
in my current situation.

174
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:39,654
You seem to be busy,
New Chief Nepela.

175
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,456
Yes. If it's possible, I'd like you
to advise me on some things.

176
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:47,693
This case is just so chaotic.

177
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:51,099
The connection between
the Prague station and

178
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,333
the former Czechoslovakian
secret police.

179
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:57,573
It all happened when we discovered
the body of an inspector

180
00:15:57,644 --> 00:16:01,672
by the name of Zeman with the bodies
of several secret police agents.

181
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,396
Inspector Zeman was investigating
the murder of a man

182
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,481
who was running
an unauthorized orphanage.

183
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:13,687
We found out afterwards that Zeman
and the orphanage manager

184
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,663
were both involved with
the secret police!

185
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:20,396
Who's the suspect in that case?

186
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:24,969
Grimmer, the man who discovered
the manager's murder, was suspected.

187
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:27,969
But the children at the orphanage
saw someone else

188
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,476
leaving the scene of the crime
immediately after it happened.

189
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:32,373
Someone else?

190
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,306
A beautiful blonde woman.

191
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:40,980
But the case didn't end there.
It spread.

192
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:44,414
The former head chief of this station
and two veteran detectives

193
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:46,459
were murdered with
poisoned candies.

194
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,898
They were also involved with the
former Czechoslovakian secret police.

195
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,331
Who was the suspect
in the poisoning case?

196
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,971
A young detective
by the name of Suk.

197
00:16:58,038 --> 00:16:59,870
He was Inspector Zeman's
direct subordinate.

198
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,307
Do you have any
conclusive evidence?

199
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:03,336
We don't have any.

200
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:08,644
But two detectives from a special
team who were watching Suk

201
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:11,241
were found shot dead
in Suk's room!

202
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:13,052
I see.

203
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,449
So where's Detective Suk?

204
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:17,921
His whereabouts
are currently unknown.

205
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:21,253
The circumstantial evidence
points at Suk.

206
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:23,961
But he doesn't have
enough of a motive, right?

207
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:25,490
Y-Yes.

208
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:28,934
He doesn't seem like
he would commit such a crime.

209
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,097
Y-Yes. Umm...
How do you know that?

210
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,937
I know of a very similar case.

211
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,337
As I would expect of you.

212
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:44,049
That hand keeps on moving
even when you're on vacation.

213
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:50,456
You're accumulating objective data,
aren't you?

214
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:55,419
And at the lecture, you also said
that you use that data to perform

215
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:57,987
a completely subjective
investigation at the same time.

216
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:01,457
In other words, you become
the criminal, right?

217
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:03,326
What do you think?

218
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:08,039
If you were Suk, what would you be
thinking and where would you be right now?

219
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:13,505
Sorry.
Unfortunately, I'm on vacation.

220
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:16,778
Oh... No, I'm very sorry!

221
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:19,149
How is Prague?

222
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,351
I've been going to
second-hand bookstores.

223
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:24,482
Second-hand bookstores...
Are you searching for something?

224
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:27,319
I looked in thirteen stores.

225
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:29,923
I finally found one.

226
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:35,132
Actually, I came to you today
to ask if you could translate

227
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:38,467
this Czech into German
when you have the time.

228
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:44,172
Oh? A picture book?
I'm surprised.

229
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:46,572
I didn't think you were
interested in such things.

230
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:48,712
Leave it with me.

231
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:50,375
I'll have a subordinate
do it by tomorrow!

232
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:53,481
Is it for your child.. .
I mean, your grandchild?

233
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:56,749
Yes. I guess it is.

234
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,053
Suk is completely innocent!

235
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:06,298
As his friend,
I believe that he's innocent!

236
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:09,598
The police asked me
all sorts of questions,

237
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,435
but he isn't guilty at all.

238
00:19:13,507 --> 00:19:16,602
If you're involved with the police,
please help him.

239
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:19,705
We'll help you
as much as we can!

240
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:25,543
Unfortunately, I'm on vacation.
I can't be of much help to you.

241
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:31,916
Is there anyone else he trusts?

242
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:35,959
He was getting close to a girl.

243
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,097
He'd just managed
to find out her name.

244
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,758
What was her name?

245
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:41,794
Anna.

246
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:43,902
Oh yeah. Anna Liebert!

247
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:47,968
She was a really
beautiful blonde woman.

248
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:51,307
He was glad that things
were going well with her.

249
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:55,945
<i>Anna Liebert.</i>

250
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:59,178
<i>Ten years ago, the family
of a high ranking official</i>

251
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:01,846
<i>who defected from
East Germany was killed.</i>

252
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:04,452
<i>She was one of the twins
who survived.</i>

253
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:11,121
I don't think there's
anything left.

254
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:14,292
My company was the one

255
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:18,167
that published Emile Scherbe's
<i>The Nameless Monster,</i>

256
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:20,639
but that was during
the old regime,

257
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:23,506
when the previous company
president was around.

258
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,308
Is Emile Scherbe a pen name?

259
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,208
Yes. It probably is.

260
00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:32,244
He has many other pen names.

261
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:37,266
Something Bonaparta. ..
and Jakov Farobek...

262
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,849
Klaus Poppe, etc...

263
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:41,857
Klaus Poppe's box
is right here.

264
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:44,163
What? I'm surprised
you found that.

265
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:45,531
Can I open it?

266
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:46,999
Yes. Go right ahead.

267
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:50,062
They're just a mountain of
old rough sketches, right?!

268
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:12,391
A pregnant woman.

269
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:18,159
And she gave birth.

270
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:23,626
A girl.

271
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,908
Twins...

272
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:45,686
I see.
You translated it for me.

273
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:48,458
Thank you, Chief Nepela.

274
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:52,730
Oh. There's something
I've been wondering about.

275
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:56,400
Could you read me
the last page?

276
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,836
<i>Umm...</i>

277
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,537
<i>"At last he had
found a name, "</i>

278
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:05,704
<i>"but there was no longer
anyone around to call him by it."</i>

279
00:22:06,446 --> 00:22:09,108
<i>"Such a shame because Johan
was such a wonderful name"</i>

280
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:11,681
<i>What a strange
picture book.</i>

281
00:22:12,118 --> 00:22:13,085
Johan...

282
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:17,757
<i>inspector Lunge, would you
care to have dinner with me?</i>

283
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,760
<i>How long is your vacation?</i>

284
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:21,720
You there.

285
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:22,588
Yes?

286
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,255
Cancel my beer.
Make it a coffee.

287
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:29,896
It looks like I'm going to
be taking a long vacation.
