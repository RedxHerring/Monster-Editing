1
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:12,326
Come on, eat!
The weisswurst here is especially good!

2
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:16,665
Isn't it delicious?
Umm...Dieter, was it?

3
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:22,907
Come on, if you don't eat anything,
Dieter will eat it all.

4
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:26,270
There's no need to worry, Dr. Tenma.

5
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:30,684
This place is safe.
Only regulars come here.

6
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:36,046
If a stranger comes around
Otto here will drive them out.

7
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:39,827
Business has been bad
since I've been doing that.

8
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:42,220
Who ordered the spätzle?

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,091
Oh, that would be me.

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,225
I made a bed in the attic.

11
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:50,268
You can sleep peacefully if
you can ignore the rats.

12
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:52,835
Thanks, Otto.

13
00:00:55,476 --> 00:00:57,535
He's unsociable,
but he's a good guy.

14
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,741
Come on, you can't do battle
on an empty stomach!

15
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:03,880
Thank you for everything,
and for finding me a room.

16
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,553
I should be the one thanking you.

17
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:10,891
I'd be in the morgue right now
if you hadn't saved me.

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,727
I can eat good food like this
because I'm alive.

19
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:17,325
Now, eat!

20
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:21,963
I've contacted Dr. Gillen.

21
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,939
He's also relieved that we found you.

22
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:29,573
He left an ad calling out to you
in the newspaper.

23
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:32,580
Let's talk about our memories
of cheating"...

24
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:34,375
You knew?

25
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:35,475
Yes.

26
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:38,279
Why didn't you contact him–?

27
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:42,454
I didn't want to get him involved.

28
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:48,788
Don't be so reserved.
Friends are good to have.

29
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,728
So, what's this about you
keeping watch over me?

30
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:57,368
The Richard Braun case...

31
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:58,973
Richard?

32
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,535
The time he shot a young serial killer
while working on the police force.

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,676
While I was reading the article,
Dieter saw the boy's picture.

34
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:16,583
He said that boy was
in 511 Kinderheim.

35
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,559
511 Kinderheim?

36
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:23,158
It was an East German orphanage.
A very special one.

37
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:26,395
Dieter's foster parent was
an instructor there.

38
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,667
He kept a lot of pictures of
the children that were there.

39
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:32,964
What happened to the orphanage?

40
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:34,973
Johan was also there.

41
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,269
Are you saying that
there's a connection

42
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:40,440
between Johan and the boy
that Richard shot?

43
00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:42,182
I don't know.

44
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:47,845
Richard was dead before I
could get the details from him.

45
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,360
I saw you in front of Richard's grave...

46
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:55,056
Richard...

47
00:02:55,897 --> 00:03:00,232
It's as if he led you to me.

48
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:05,429
You've done your best
by yourself until now.

49
00:03:06,107 --> 00:03:08,599
But you're not alone anymore!

50
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:13,910
Your innocence will be proven.
Johan is right before your eyes!

51
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:15,049
The photograph...

52
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,284
Oh no. I left it in the office!

53
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:23,480
We would have understood everything
if I showed you Johan's photo...

54
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:27,393
That man who was trying to
kill you probably...

55
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,596
He probably destroyed it, didn't he?

56
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:36,733
That man...came into counseling with
his wife under the name Hesse.

57
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:39,799
I tried to contact him,

58
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:42,935
but there was nobody by
the name of Hesse.

59
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:46,875
Johan is right before our eyes.

60
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:50,244
He's here.
That means we can meet him, right?

61
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:51,877
Yes.

62
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:55,279
I can meet Johan...in person.

63
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,341
Thalbach & Schuwald AG...

64
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:33,886
The company at the center of
the Schuwald financial group.

65
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:39,151
Schuwald hardly ever went out in public,
but lately has.

66
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:44,262
Around this time in the morning,
he goes to his affiliated companies.

67
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,994
It's something that Richard discovered
when he was still alive.

68
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,735
Not only this company,

69
00:05:49,804 --> 00:05:52,239
but all the businesses in
his financial group

70
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:58,769
have seen a huge growth in profits ever
since that boy became his right-hand man.

71
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:02,214
Here he comes.

72
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:12,418
Schuwald's the one in the wheelchair.

73
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:14,956
Karl's the one pushing him.

74
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:17,231
And...

75
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,645
So is that him?

76
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,691
There's...no mistake.

77
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:47,586
All right.

78
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:49,963
This is the first time.

79
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:56,235
This is the first time I've seen
Johan in broad daylight.

80
00:06:57,371 --> 00:07:01,103
That's right. Let's bring everything out
into the light!

81
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:03,833
This is my only chance.

82
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:07,541
Yes. Now's your only chance
to prove your innocence!

83
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:12,575
But for now, you should keep
hiding out in Otto's attic.

84
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:16,049
We'll prove your innocence soon.

85
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:22,189
Richard's file is around here...

86
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:25,126
Here it is.

87
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,166
I'm glad I took it home with me.

88
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:35,442
Just a little longer.

89
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:38,508
Just a little longer, Richard.

90
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,211
We'll avenge you soon.

91
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:44,744
We've cornered Johan!

92
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,955
We've found Dr. Tenma,
the decisive witness.

93
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:50,549
All that's left...

94
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:55,657
<i>All that's left is to find someone
who saw Richard the night he died.</i>

95
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:56,964
There's got to be someone.

96
00:07:57,465 --> 00:07:58,432
Once we do,

97
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:02,595
we'll be able to prove that Johan was
the man who was with you that night.

98
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,162
Even if we can't do that,
there's Fahren,

99
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:08,641
the student who claimed he was
Schuwald's son and committed suicide.

100
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:12,772
If we can find the prostitute he visited,

101
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:17,978
then we'll be able to prove that the boy
who accompanied him was Johan.

102
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:19,877
No, that's not all!

103
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:22,383
We'll be able to
find out who Johan is

104
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,484
if we question the couple who say
they're Johan's parents!

105
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:30,762
That's because we've found
Johan Liebert's grave.

106
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:34,828
We've closed a trap around Johan!

107
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:45,170
Say, Dr. Tenma...
I think of Richard when I look at you.

108
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:51,240
It's as if you're trying to shoulder
the burdens of the entire world.

109
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,752
But you're not alone!

110
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:59,226
There's Dieter and
Dr. Gillen and myself!

111
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:04,155
Things are all right now.
Rest easy tonight.

112
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:13,241
<i>I didn't want to
get him involved!</i>

113
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:17,310
<i>This is the first time.</i>

114
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:22,341
<i>This is the first time I've seen
Johan in broad daylight.</i>

115
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,053
<i>This is my only chance...</i>

116
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,082
<i>Y-You're...</i>

117
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:33,660
<i>Quickly run away!</i>

118
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:36,355
<i>Quickly!</i>

119
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:49,837
Reichwein speaking.

120
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:52,237
<i>This is Gillen.</i>

121
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:57,014
Ah, I was just about to call you.

122
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:01,785
<i>I'm on the way!
What is Tenma doing?</i>

123
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:04,753
He's at the safe house.

124
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:08,095
Tell him firmly that he is not
to leave that place.

125
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:10,356
There's something that's bothering me.

126
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:11,959
<i>Me too.</i>

127
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:12,892
Huh?

128
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,231
<i>He... Dr. Tenma's not chasing
Johan to prove his innocence.</i>

129
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:24,172
<i>I didn't want to believe it...
but I was also worried about that!</i>

130
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:41,962
Dieter...

131
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:48,465
Why are you here?

132
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,635
Tenma...told me to come here.

133
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:55,802
Where's Tenma?

134
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:58,145
He left.

135
00:10:58,512 --> 00:10:59,138
Where?

136
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,077
He plans to do it.

137
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:01,974
Huh?

138
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,582
Tenma plans to do it.

139
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,384
Stop him, Mr. Reichwein...
Stop him.

140
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,264
Tenma's going to become
a murderer!

141
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:47,290
Let's leave it at that for today.

142
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:50,556
Don't say that.
Ask me about it, Doctor.

143
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:53,233
It gets interesting from here.

144
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:54,293
No.

145
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:57,261
I'll ask you about it next time.

146
00:11:57,838 --> 00:12:02,002
The third woman I killed...
This one is great.

147
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,005
Come on, Doctor.

148
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,340
Come on, listen to me!

149
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:11,347
How do you think she screamed
when I strangled her?

150
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:12,680
Come on, Doctor.

151
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:16,955
Listen to me, Doctor.
That woman...

152
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:25,989
Where did you go, Tenma–?

153
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:31,537
We finally meet, Dr. Gillen.

154
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:34,333
Who are you?

155
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:38,208
I'm Lunge of the BKA.

156
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:42,382
I've heard rumors about you.

157
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:48,854
You've apprehended several of the serial
homicide offenders I'm researching.

158
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:54,292
I've read your book.

159
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:56,162
Thank you.

160
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,697
<i>Transcendental Criminal Psychology.</i>
A wonderful book!

161
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:08,000
There is no other essay that goes so far
into the mind of a serial killer.

162
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:16,240
Especially the study on Heinz Kaul
in Chapter 3 on pages 262 to 294.

163
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:19,146
I read with great interest about

164
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:24,214
how his childhood trauma was
linked to his crimes.

165
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:28,059
You seem well versed.

166
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:30,854
I am honored that you have read
my book so carefully.

167
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:35,901
My investigative technique also involves
getting into the mind of the criminal.

168
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:40,704
I try to figure out their actions
by becoming them.

169
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,566
It seems like you have quite
some experience.

170
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:46,742
Tell me about it later,
when we have the time.

171
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:51,879
It seems we both don't have that much
time, so I'm going to ask you right now.

172
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:56,351
You've been going to Munich a lot, lately.
Haven't you?

173
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:58,616
What about that?

174
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:03,026
Well, sit down.
I won't take too much time.

175
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:09,364
You've been seeing Professor Reichwein,
a counseling psychologist.

176
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,837
You went yesterday as well.

177
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:14,232
Yes. He was my professor in college.

178
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:16,369
At the Düsseldorf University?

179
00:14:17,077 --> 00:14:17,703
Yes.

180
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:22,343
There was a brilliant neurosurgeon
who was in the same class as you

181
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,078
at Düsseldorf University, wasn't there?

182
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:27,986
What are you trying to say?

183
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:31,456
Have you seen Dr. Tenma?

184
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:34,391
What are you talking about?

185
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:37,556
Let's talk about our memories
of cheating. Rudi."

186
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:43,600
You placed that classified ad in all the
leading newspapers across the country

187
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,661
from May 1 st to the 22nd.

188
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:47,836
I'm surprised.

189
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:53,575
I never thought that brilliant people
like you or Dr. Tenma

190
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:56,173
cheated when you were students.

191
00:14:57,184 --> 00:14:59,380
It's good to have a best friend.

192
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:04,185
I wasn't really best friends with
Dr. Tenma when we were students.

193
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:06,784
Last May in Oder Park.

194
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:11,958
With your help, the Velbert police
were able to surround Dr. Tenma.

195
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,101
They almost took him into custody.
But he escaped.

196
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:18,664
The wiretap on me malfunctioned.

197
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,239
You could have helped him to escape.

198
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:27,477
He... Dr. Tenma is innocent!

199
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:29,449
Oh?

200
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:32,084
Listen to me with an open mind.

201
00:15:32,786 --> 00:15:35,365
The murder of the director of
the Eisler Memorial Hospital

202
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:36,948
and three others in Düsseldorf.

203
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:40,117
The murder of a patient in a building
under construction.

204
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,254
The murder in Heidelberg.

205
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:45,727
The murders of middle-aged couples
across the country.

206
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,934
Tenma isn't the one who did them.

207
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:52,836
This is the conclusion I have drawn
as a criminal psychologist

208
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:54,396
from interviewing him in person.

209
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:58,609
I see... So where is he right now?

210
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:01,781
He's gone off somewhere again.

211
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:04,076
Why did he run away?

212
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:06,652
Why would he run away
if he's innocent?

213
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,853
He didn't run away!

214
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:13,082
So why has he disappeared from you,
his best friend?

215
00:16:18,465 --> 00:16:20,957
I have proof that
he isn't the culprit.

216
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:23,629
Take a look at this.

217
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:30,109
This is an analysis of all the information
concerning this case.

218
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:58,232
This is a considerable amount of work.

219
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,609
So...do you understand?

220
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:04,570
Yes.

221
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,107
The unnatural death of Fahren,

222
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:10,343
the boy who pretended to
be Schuwald's son.

223
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:12,147
The unnatural death of Richard Braun,

224
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:14,847
the ex-police detective who
was investigating this case.

225
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,457
The questions surrounding
Schuwald's illegitimate child.

226
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,462
There is a boy at the center
of all of this.

227
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:26,892
His name is the same one
that Tenma said was the real culprit

228
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,492
when he was questioned...

229
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:30,800
Johan Liebert.

230
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:35,931
The gravestone of a person with
the same first and last name

231
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:37,602
was discovered in Bruntal.

232
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:42,575
Furthermore, someone went after
Dr. Reichwein after he picked up

233
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:45,675
the investigation from where
Richard Braun left off.

234
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,447
I understand very well.

235
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:54,717
It's impossible.

236
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:59,557
It is impossible to prove that
all these events are connected.

237
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:05,369
Tenma went into hiding because
he understands this the most.

238
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:08,399
Am I wrong?

239
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:18,877
Your hand movements.

240
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:24,047
Yes. Don't pay any attention to it.

241
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:26,988
It's just a mnemonic tool.

242
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:30,261
As a psychologist, it seems to me

243
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,358
that your anxiety is manifesting
itself in your hand.

244
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:39,069
I'm the same. instead of my hand,
I have my cassette recorder.

245
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:43,501
But the sound that's recorded
on this tape is objective.

246
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:47,908
The information that you remember
through your hand movements

247
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:50,848
immediately becomes tainted
with your opinions.

248
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:55,685
That's probably how you've done
your job until now.

249
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:58,191
You believe that
your hand's memory is correct–

250
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:01,159
that your judgment isn't wrong.

251
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:06,324
Do you have a family?
Do you have any hobbies?

252
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,927
Do you live for your job?

253
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:11,428
Have you ever made a mistake?

254
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:14,466
Aren't you terribly afraid
to make a mistake?

255
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:18,877
To you, Tenma has to be a bad person.

256
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:22,974
If not, then your self-identity would suffer.

257
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:30,247
Look at the truth.
This is a photograph of Johan Liebert.

258
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,623
Can you prove that
these are all Tenma's lies?

259
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:49,504
This boy... Where is he right now?

260
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,737
He's a student of the University of
Munich.

261
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:54,608
At the moment, he's Schuwald's
secretary.

262
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,284
Do you mind if I hold on
to this photograph?

263
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,284
From here on,
this is a matter for the police.

264
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:12,825
I might have made a terrible mistake.

265
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:16,068
Where is Dr. Tenma right now?

266
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:21,037
H-He should be in Munich.

267
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,552
Yes...this is Lunge.

268
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,161
Get me the Munich police.

269
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:46,364
I need to request
emergency deployment.

270
00:20:48,635 --> 00:20:50,694
Tenma is within the city of Munich.

271
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:00,672
A sniper rifle?

272
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:04,408
I don't know what you're talking about.

273
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:07,644
You should have had a call
from Mr. Heitmeyer

274
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,086
from the mountain villa in Fussen.

275
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:14,488
10,000 marks in advance.

276
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:17,096
I have it ready.

277
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:25,771
Your order is a little troublesome,
so it'll take a week.

278
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:29,238
Meanwhile, do something about
that pale body of yours.

279
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:35,405
It's a waste if you have a lot of
good tools, but can't use them.

280
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:41,954
<i>Next in the news.</i>

281
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:47,226
<i>A reception was held for the
Munich Electronics Industry Trade Fair</i>

282
00:21:47,294 --> 00:21:49,524
<i>which is going to be hosted next week
by the state chamber of commerce.</i>

283

284
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:56,793
<i>With the formation of the EU,

285
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,430

286
00:21:59,873 --> 00:22:02,843
<i>This will be the largest trade fair
that this city has ever hosted.</i>

287
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:08,909
<i>Hans Georg Schuwald' who hasn't
appeared in public for nearly 20 years</i>

288
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:14,580
<i>attended this reception and received an
applause from the whole audience.</i>

289

00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:22,819
