1
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:12,489
Are you crying?

2
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:15,603
This letter from my friend...

3
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:18,032
My best friend...

4
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:25,139
When we were 15, we tried to cross
the Czech border together.

5
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:29,143
She was caught
and taken to Prague.

6
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:33,276
She says she's doing fine.

7
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:37,954
She knows me better than
my parents or my siblings.

8
00:00:38,426 --> 00:00:39,689
She's a true friend.

9
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:43,727
Who knows how much trouble
she went through to get this to me,

10
00:00:43,798 --> 00:00:46,062
with all the government's
harsh inspections.

11
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:52,036
She says, "Please visit me
if you have the chance."

12
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:56,337
"Cedok Bridge,
Three Frogs"...

13
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:00,246
I want to go back to Prague.

14
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:03,450
Margot...

15
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:12,552
Say...

16
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,428
Call me by my real name.

17
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:24,237
Just for today, I want you to
call me by my real name.

18
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:27,373
I'm Helenka Novakova.

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,247
Just for today,
I'm not Margot Langer.

20
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:09,507
I sold my stocks in Reiser-Berger
Pharmaceuticals at the right time.

21
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:14,809
Then, when I bought some stocks in
Knutter Laboratories, I hit the jackpot!

22
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:18,842
Well, it was cause
for celebration, so...

23
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,483
You had a drink?

24
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,089
Yes. Just a little.

25
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,025
How foolish.

26
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,818
It was just one drink.

27
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:28,157
I'll say it again.

28
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:33,861
For an alcoholic, drinking just a little
is the same as drinking a lot.

29
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:38,401
It doesn't seem like you've been going to
the alcohol relief group I introduced you to.

30
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:40,766
By the way. .. Umm...

31
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:43,940
Doctor, you can keep a secret,
can't you?

32
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:47,877
Actually, there's a woman
I want you to meet.

33
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:51,351
You have another mistress?

34
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:52,753
No, well...

35
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:55,681
She's also
a pretty bad alcoholic.

36
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:58,924
She's waiting outside right now.
Could you see her for a moment?

37
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:01,356
Not suddenly like this.

38
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:03,664
Make an appointment.

39
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:06,095
Just for a little while
will be fine.

40
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:10,461
I've got a house call right now.
It's for an important client.

41
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:14,141
I went to Prague
in the Czech Republic.

42
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:17,243
It's a really nice place.

43
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:21,080
Prague Castle...
Wonderful Gothic cathedrals...

44
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:25,075
It's beautiful when
the old town plaza lights up!

45
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,748
It's like a village
out of a fairytale.

46
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:30,152
What about Cedok Bridge?

47
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:32,883
Did you go to Cedok Bridge?

48
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:34,287
Of course!

49
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:41,396
I did as you told me to do
and I found it. Even the three frogs!

50
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,404
Was the woman there?

51
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,341
No. No one was there.

52
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:54,879
Actually, I didn't learn
anything by going there.

53
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,995
I couldn't find anything
on Tenma's whereabouts,

54
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:01,751
and I also couldn't find anything
on Nina and Dieter.

55
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:08,462
Take this.

56
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:14,769
It's a lucky rabbit's foot.

57
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:19,303
I want you give it to
our soon-to-be child.

58
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:27,012
Margot... No, Helenka... I ...

59
00:05:34,388 --> 00:05:35,355
Thank you.

60
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:02,575
Yes?

61
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,883
Excuse me.

62
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:06,785
I've come from Germany
in search of a woman

63
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:08,856
whose whereabouts
are unknown.

64
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:16,294
Do you know a woman by the name of
Margot Langer–no, Helenka Novakova?

65
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:18,999
Helenka...

66
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,767
Anyway, Mr. Schuwald...

67
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:25,668
I heard from your son, Karl.

68
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:30,433
You haven't been able
to eat properly.

69
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:40,049
You had a petrifying experience at the
fire in the University of Munich library.

70
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:44,684
I know that the fear
still hasn't left you.

71
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:52,061
But you have Karl...
A wonderful son.

72
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:57,269
You have nothing more
to worry about!

73
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,868
Make sure to eat more.

74
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:02,303
The monster...

75
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:07,247
As long as that
monster exists.. .I...

76
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:15,746
Why did that monster know
so much about Margot Langer?

77
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:22,461
He knew far more than
either her son Karl or I did.

78
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:28,668
Margot's best friend, the one who knew her
better than her parents or her siblings...

79
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,171
The woman who Margot
exchanged letters with...

80
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,678
In the '80s, you searched for Margot,
who had gone missing.

81
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:40,846
You went to Prague
and met that woman.

82
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:48,345
Yes. I thought that that woman might
have heard something from Margot.

83
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,088
But she knew nothing.

84
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:58,727
We talked for a while
about Margot at the door.

85
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:05,137
That's when they were listening
to our conversation.

86
00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:06,699
Who was?

87
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:12,545
They were quietly listening
behind that woman.

88
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:14,573
The twins...

89
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:19,948
Come in!

90
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:22,852
Sit over there.

91
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:27,525
You're the person that Mr. Thalbach
wanted me to see, aren't you?

92
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,495
You can't stop drinking either?

93
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,961
Make yourself comfortable.

94
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:34,666
Just act as if we're
going to have a little chat.

95
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:36,129
Doctor!

96
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:37,495
What's wrong, Mereth?

97
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:39,039
I'm in the middle of counseling.

98
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:40,437
On TV! Right now on TV!

99
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,473
It's Tenma. Dr. Tenma!

100
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:44,511
Excuse me for a second!

101
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:50,575
<i>I repeat, the Czech police have
apprehended in Prague</i>

102
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:53,096
<i>the prime suspect of
the poisoning of three doctors</i>

103
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,350
<i>of Dusseldorf Germany's
Eisler Memorial Hospital,</i>

104
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:59,690
<i>the murders of the journalist Maurer
and the Fortner couple in Heidelberg</i>

105
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,526
<i>and the phantom killing
at Heidelberg Castle...</i>

106
00:09:03,597 --> 00:09:08,467
<i>the Japanese Doctor Kenzo Tenma was
apprehended on the afternoon of the fifth.</i>

107
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,898
<i>We have not received
any further information.</i>

108
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:15,403
<i>We will continue to report the details
of how he was taken into custody when</i>

109
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:17,706
<i>- the police make their announcement.</i>
- Tenma...

110
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:20,347
Don't!
This is the office.

111
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:23,846
Please wait in the consultation room,
Miss Eva Heinemann!

112
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:26,753
Kenzo...

113
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,824
Sorry everyone,
for coming late.

114
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:34,327
Mr. Hess, you look like you've
gotten ten years younger!

115
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:37,025
That's because I'm always
playing with my grandchild.

116
00:09:37,798 --> 00:09:39,266
Huber, how are you doing?

117
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,962
Well, I've managed to move up
to my final academic year!

118
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:46,103
Mr. Kieffer, I hear you're
pretty busy too.

119
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,209
I was bragging about how
I'm friends with a scriptwriter

120
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:51,802
who's been invited
to go to Hollywood.

121
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,806
I just happened to catch
the eye of one of their producers.

122
00:09:56,584 --> 00:10:00,578
My mind has cleared and
new ideas keep coming!

123
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:02,356
Sounds promising!

124
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,316
Ever since that surgery...

125
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:13,056
If my brain operation hadn't
been successful, I'd be...

126
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:18,999
I wouldn't have been able to walk
with my grandchild in the park.

127
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:21,234
That seat...

128
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,345
He always sat there
drinking tea by himself.

129
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:29,874
There were other cafes
where doctors gathered.

130
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:33,685
But he came to this café
behind Eisler Memorial Hospital.

131
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:37,089
When we patients
would come in...

132
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:39,753
...he'd raise his head
as he sat there...

133
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:42,392
...and smile and wave.

134
00:10:43,397 --> 00:10:44,762
He was a kind doctor.

135
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:46,257
Yes.

136
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:51,399
Such a kind doctor. ..
would never do this!

137
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,802
This is why I've
gathered everyone here.

138
00:10:56,477 --> 00:11:00,175
No, even the people who couldn't come
here today would feel the same as we do.

139
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:02,682
They were Dr. Tenma's
former patients, too.

140
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:06,376
Dr. Schumann, bad news!

141
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,588
Old man Merkel collapsed!

142
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,558
All right! I'll be right there!

143
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:15,353
But I'm busy right now.
Sorry, but wait for me there!

144
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:16,222
All right!

145
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:21,432
Dr. Tenma never
did those things.

146
00:11:21,502 --> 00:11:23,197
Calm down and
listen to me, Mom!

147
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:25,963
Go to him quickly, Dear.

148
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:28,373
Yes. But, Petra...

149
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:33,409
No buts! Dr. Tenma was arrested
for a crime he didn't commit!

150
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:37,681
If he hadn't been around,
I wouldn't be alive!

151
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:44,320
Dr. Schumann, don't you care about
the man who saved your wife's life?!

152
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:47,188
What'll happen to this village?

153
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:48,287
Huh?

154
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:50,721
I'm the only doctor in this village.

155
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:54,563
What'll happen to the folks
in this town if I'm gone?

156
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,869
Don't blabber on.
You want to go, don't you?!

157
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:01,169
Quickly, go and save Tenma!

158
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:05,578
If there's a patient,
a doctor mustn't leave him.

159
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,776
That's what Dr. Tenma
would do.

160
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:12,379
Doctor, see us quickly!

161
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:14,854
Wait, I'm getting ready
right now!

162
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:16,454
How long are you going to
make us wait?!

163
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:17,950
Don't complain!

164
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,794
Lately, the doctor has been
going to medical school.

165
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:23,996
It's risky for her to examine
patients here illegally!

166
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:31,865
<i>When you're in darkness,
you just sink deeper into it.</i>

167
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:33,931
<i>Shine some light.</i>

168
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,573
<i>You can do it!</i>

169
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:40,444
<i>You can become
a good doctor.</i>

170
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:42,707
Dr. Tenma...

171
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,321
I'm going to start examining patients!
Whoever's first come in!

172
00:12:57,464 --> 00:12:58,556
Get a lawyer.

173
00:12:58,899 --> 00:12:59,525
Yes.

174
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:05,231
But we still don't know where in
Germany Tenma will be transferred to.

175
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,704
Retain an attorney
from each state.

176
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:14,271
Get the best criminal attorney.

177
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:15,508
Yes!

178
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:16,977
He's the only one...

179
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:24,456
He's the only man who
can erase the monster.

180
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:30,423
First off, we need to
get more allies.

181
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:34,296
Let's call Dr. Tenma's
former patients!

182
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:38,563
We may be weak as individuals,
but if we join together...

183
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:39,598
All right!

184
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:45,106
Let's ask Eisler Memorial Hospital
for help in forming a relief group.

185
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:46,809
It's impossible.

186
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:51,579
Eisler Memorial Hospital won't
help you with something like that.

187
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,388
I was listening to you.
It was quite a touching story.

188
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:01,660
But think hard about it.

189
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,127
How will you prove
Tenma's innocence?

190
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:08,429
Dr. Becker...

191
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:13,136
He has some motive,
but no alibi.

192
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:17,366
They even say that
there's physical evidence.

193
00:14:18,145 --> 00:14:20,842
Even if you gather numbers
and make a lot of noise...

194
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:24,747
No, no matter how brilliant
a lawyer you hire...

195
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:30,055
No matter what, it's impossible
to prove Tenma's innocence.

196
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:37,531
How unfortunate for
such a brilliant doctor.

197
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,360
Truly unfortunate.

198
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:45,469
I'll ask you once more...

199
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:49,438
What's your relationship
to Tenma?

200
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,411
Miss Eva Heinemann...

201
00:14:54,715 --> 00:15:00,176
I don't know who you are,
but I'm going to go save Tenma.

202
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:04,323
I don't want you to come with me
if you're just going to sightsee.

203
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:07,254
Eva... Heinemann...

204
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:09,863
Heinemann!

205
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,421
Heinemann...

206
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:15,627
Could it be that you're the daughter
of Director Heinemann,

207
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:19,138
who was killed at Eisler Hospital
in Düsseldorf?!

208
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:21,202
Dr. Tenma...

209
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:25,674
He's the man that
destroyed my life.

210
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:31,379
But I'm the only one
who can save him.

211
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:33,045
Huh?

212
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:34,988
I saw.

213
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:35,948
Saw what?

214
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:46,459
<i>Kenzo Tenma is being
detained in Prague.</i>

215
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,803
<i>He will be deported to Germany
in a day or two.</i>

216
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,235
<i>He's being moved to Düsseldorf
where it is believed these incidents began.</i>

217
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:58,677
<i>After interrogation...</i>

218
00:15:58,745 --> 00:15:59,371
No way.

219
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,347
That's impossible.

220
00:16:02,282 --> 00:16:04,444
This person is...
This doctor is...

221
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:09,247
<i>This is Dr. Tenma.
Suk, he saved your life.</i>

222
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,386
<i>He applied first aid.</i>

223
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:16,285
<i>He's also been framed for
a crime he didn't commit.</i>

224
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:18,988
<i>He's in the same
situation you are.</i>

225
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:23,996
Saved my life.
Same situation as me...

226
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,365
<i>You're a detective
aren't you?</i>

227
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:31,538
<i>If you're a detective,
you must dissect everything calmly.</i>

228
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:36,678
<i>If you don't want to be
betrayed anymore,</i>

229
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,685
<i>doubt the people you don't
ever want to doubt.</i>

230
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:49,562
I've got to go.

231
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:54,464
Anyway, I've got to go to
Prague station and talk to Tenma!

232
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,438
I've been looking for you, Suk.

233
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:04,769
Detective Bradec,
Detective Stransky...

234
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:06,505
I...

235
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:08,372
You don't have to
run away anymore.

236
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:09,542
Huh?

237
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:11,951
You must have had
a terrible time.

238
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,887
You've been cleared.

239
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:17,716
A letter was sent to the station.

240
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:19,459
Here's a copy.

241
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:21,253
A letter?

242
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:24,092
It's a confession that gives
the details of all the events

243
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,292
that only the culprit
would know.

244
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:29,099
You've been cleared
of all suspicion.

245
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,301
Wh-Who sent this letter?

246
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:33,729
A man who goes
by the name Grimmer.

247
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:35,568
What?

248
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:40,146
Grimmer has been put on
the wanted list as a prime suspect.

249
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:42,148
H-Hold on a second.

250
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:44,382
Relax, Suk.

251
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:49,165
Inspector Zeman's murder,
the chief's poisoning,

252
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:53,990
and the shooting of the special
investigations team have all been solved.

253
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:03,890
<i>Where have you been,
Lunge?!</i>

254
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:05,961
<i>I called you
so many times!</i>

255
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:08,759
Well, Chief,
I was doing some sightseeing.

256
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:11,469
<i>Honestly!
Don't act dumb!</i>

257
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:14,170
Act dumb?
What are you talking about?

258
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:17,475
<i>Cut it out! Don't tell me you
haven't heard the news!</i>

259
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:21,674
Oh. Are you talking about
Dr. Tenma's arrest?

260
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:23,742
<i>Congratulations, Lunge!</i>

261
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:24,677
Huh?

262
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:28,480
<i>You knew that Tenma was
hiding in Prague, didn't you?</i>

263
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:30,754
<i>Good work, Lunge!</i>

264
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:34,023
<i>Your persistent investigation
has paid off.</i>

265
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:40,567
<i>We've finished talking
to the Czech police.</i>

266
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:44,034
<i>Tenma will be transferred to
Düsseldorf tomorrow afternoon.</i>

267
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:48,664
<i>You're in charge of this case.
Come and take direct command!</i>

268
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:53,040
<i>Anyway good work, Lunge!
Congratulations.</i>

269
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:56,181
Dispatch someone
other than me.

270
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:57,009
<i>Huh?</i>

271
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,052
Prague is a nice place.

272
00:19:59,319 --> 00:19:59,979
<i>What?!</i>

273
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:04,089
Besides,
I'm on vacation right now.

274
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,184
<i>Hey Lunge!
What are you talking about?</i>

275
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,986
<i>Hey!</i>

276
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:11,290
Let me see Dr. Tenma!

277
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:14,730
I keep telling you,
you can't see him!

278
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:18,700
Tell me why!
This country is a democracy.

279
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:22,206
Tenma is already going to
be deported to Germany.

280
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:24,705
Just let me see him
for a bit before you do!

281
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:27,446
It looks like it was
all for nothing.

282
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:30,182
We came all this way
to Prague.

283
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,384
Please ! Just once!

284
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:36,155
Get out.

285
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:40,824
Come this way.

286
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:55,371
When we interrogate people,

287
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:58,571
what kind of person do you think
we have the most trouble with?

288
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:02,412
People who don't change their
expression, no matter what we say.

289
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:04,875
People who don't talk.

290
00:21:08,488 --> 00:21:09,887
People like that.

291
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,995
"Love Letter from
the Monster to the Beauty"

292
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:26,105
It's like a draft for a novel.

293
00:21:29,476 --> 00:21:31,376
<i>"I've been watching you."</i>

294
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:34,470
<i>"I've been watching so
I could devour you whole."</i>

295
00:21:35,382 --> 00:21:38,875
<i>"But instead, everything about you
consumed me."</i>

296
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,388
<i>"When I was falling apart,
how did I look to you?"</i>

297
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:49,124
<i>"When I was falling apart,
the object that you gave me..."</i>

298
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:52,632
<i>"You left me
a beautiful jewel."</i>

299
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,169
<i>"The twins who look as if they
were blessed with eternal life."</i>

300
00:21:58,004 --> 00:22:01,770
<i>"The most sinful deed is to
take away a person's name."</i>

301
00:22:02,742 --> 00:22:04,176
<i>"Let's get your name back."</i>

302
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:06,637
<i>"I'll give you your name back."</i>

303
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:09,809
<i>"Your name is.. .Anna."</i>

304
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:12,479
<i>"Right now,
I'm just sad."</i>

305
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,653
<i>"Sad."</i>

306
00:22:15,922 --> 00:22:16,889
<i>"Sad."</i>

307
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:18,991
<i>"Sad."</i>

308
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:23,053
It exists?

309
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:26,196
Many people died
in that room.

310
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:31,262
And an incredible
monster was born.
