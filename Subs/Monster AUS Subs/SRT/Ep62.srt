1
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:27,674
<i>The experiments at Red Rose Mansion are still continuing.</i>

2
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:32,180
<i>The devil now has
an apprentice.</i>

3
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:39,019
<i>The man with glasses...
The su</i>

4
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:42,159
<i>Peter. .. Čapek...</i>

5
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:56,234
<i>He...is trying to
control the devil.</i>

6
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:20,196
Follow that car.

7
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,677
He got away!

8
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,446
Where...

9
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:47,972
Where am I?

10
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:57,414
You're awake.

11
00:03:58,526 --> 00:03:59,516
How do you feel?

12
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:01,191
Oh. Well...

13
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,191
You're lucky.
You just sprained your ankle.

14
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:08,529
From the looks of it,
you didn't hit your head hard.

15
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:11,362
But I'm not an expert like you.

16
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:13,299
You know about me?

17
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:16,702
Dr. Tenma,
a brilliant neurosurgeon.

18
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,905
I saw it in the newspaper.

19
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,447
Who are you?

20
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,815
I'm a dentist here.

21
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:24,480
Milan Kolas.

22
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:30,755
I happened to see you get hit by a car.
The car took off.

23
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:33,926
You should rest more.

24
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:36,763
No. I'm troubling you.

25
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:42,231
Wandering out on those legs and
getting caught around here by the police

26
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:43,532
would trouble me even more.

27
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:45,072
"Around here?"

28
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:51,145
This is Frankfurt's
Turkish neighborhood.

29
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:52,702
Turkish neighborhood?

30
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:56,717
No. I should say that it was
the Turkish neighborhood.

31
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:00,345
Most of this area has been
cleared for redevelopment.

32
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:05,286
Most of the Turks who lived here
have moved away.

33
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,960
A while back, when right-wing
extremists tried to burn it down,

34
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:12,295
we all joined together
to fight them.

35
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:15,727
Is the Café Bahir gone too?

36
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:18,265
Yeah. It's long gone.

37
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,934
Do you know this area?

38
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:22,806
Yeah. A little.

39
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:27,446
By the way, if you can get up, would
you like to have dinner over there?

40
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,977
Meals taste better when
eaten together, don't you think?

41
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:36,689
Today we're having Vietnamese food.
Minh made it.

42
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,052
It's pho ga and cha gio tom.

43
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,133
Minh's Vietnamese food is
exceptional. Don't be shy. Eat.

44
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,329
It's delicious.

45
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:58,370
I love pork,
but the Turks forbid it.

46
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,277
Czech food isn't good.

47
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:05,377
That's because Milan's
terrible at cooking.

48
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,787
Sorry about that.

49
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:10,452
Everyone takes turns to make
the food from his or her homeland.

50
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:14,056
It's pretty extravagant to be eating
food from different countries every day,

51
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:15,186
don't you think?

52
00:06:15,363 --> 00:06:19,163
Dr. Tenma, you're Japanese,
aren't you? How's Japanese food?

53
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,324
Japanese food, huh?

54
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:24,228
That's right.
Make some next time.

55
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:25,666
I'm looking forward to it.

56
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:29,138
Well...katsudon uses pork.

57
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:32,936
And sushi... There are some
people who can't eat raw fish.

58
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:35,983
How about Oyakodon?

59
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:37,676
Oyakodon?

60
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:42,051
Yes. Chicken covered
with eggs and sauce on rice.

61
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:44,323
Why is it called an "oyakodon"?

62
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:46,924
The chicken is the parent
and the egg is the child.

63
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:48,729
And that's why it's called
a "parent-and-child bowl"?

64
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:54,130
Who knew Japanese food
had a sense of humor!

65
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:57,768
How amusing to refer to chicken
and eggs as parent and child.

66
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:02,671
What's wrong, Tenma?

67
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:05,405
It's nothing.

68
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,445
Is the food not to your liking?

69
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:11,141
No. It's delicious.

70
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:13,487
Such delicious food...

71
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:16,147
Such a fun meal...

72
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:19,385
It's really been
such a long time.

73
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:33,868
Good night, Tenma

74
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:34,968
Good night.

75
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:44,975
How long will it take
until I can walk?

76
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,548
I don't have the time to waste.

77
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,197
Peter. ..Čapek.

78
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:09,235
A gun?

79
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:13,771
A report of Peter Čapek's
movements?

80
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:15,578
You knew it was odd,
didn't you?

81
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:21,648
The police didn't gather here
so they could catch you.

82
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:25,449
The police were on
the look out for me.

83
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:31,555
I'm...going to kill.. .
Peter Čapek.

84
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:42,233
It's no good.

85
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:46,909
That's odd. I used to be able to
make ones that flew really well.

86
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:50,417
Milan is good at making
paper airplanes.

87
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:53,847
They fly smoothly over
to that roof there.

88
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:54,848
I see.

89
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:57,148
Milan always says to us...

90
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:59,286
He always promises us...

91
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:04,329
<i>Soon enough, we'll go much further
than those rooftops.</i>

92
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:08,030
<i>We'll go to Turkey, Vietnam,
even to the Czech Republic.</i>

93
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,971
<i>We'll all go and see each other's
homelands together.</i>

94
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,665
Right?

95
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:13,433
Right.

96
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:17,603
There!

97
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:22,078
It wasn't any good.

98
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:23,446
Why won't it fly?

99
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:24,882
That's odd.

100
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,147
I'm...going to kill Peter Čapek.

101
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:35,029
Why? Mr. Milan,
why would you do that?

102
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:36,687
That man...

103
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:41,092
That man Peter Čapek
is a devil.

104
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,909
In 1989, the night before the collapse
of communism in Czechoslovakia,

105
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:51,035
he escaped into this country.

106
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:55,180
Čapek settled here
in Frankfurt

107
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:57,684
and began giving lessons
as a German language teacher.

108
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,487
He was a quiet man.

109
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,787
But after a while, there was a change
in the children who attended his classes.

110
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:11,061
One by one, the children who took
his classes began to commit suicide.

111
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:16,228
Then they began to display
extremely violent behavior.

112
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:19,764
Finally, one day,
there was a massive violent eruption.

113
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,673
It looked like the children
were trying to kill each other.

114
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:26,438
I talked to the boy who was
the ringleader of the incident

115
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:29,074
at the place where
he was being detained.

116
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:35,685
He mumbled, "I want to go back
to the recitals immediately."

117
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,457
Recitals?

118
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:41,528
That night,
the boy killed himself inside his cell.

119
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,990
He was my son.

120
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:52,135
Čapek disappeared from
the town during the riot.

121
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:57,504
The next time he appeared in town,
he was like a different man.

122
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:00,810
He was leading an underground
organization in Frankfurt.

123
00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:02,940
He had allied himself
with right-wing extremists

124
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:08,487
and he began to eject the Turks
and other foreigners from this town.

125
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:14,259
I don't know what
he's trying to do here.

126
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:18,857
But the pinnacle of
his violence was in 1996,

127
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:22,460
when he tried to burn down
the Turkish neighborhood.

128
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:26,038
You know about this incident,
don't you?

129
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:29,032
Yeah. From the news.

130
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:33,204
The people in this town formed
a neighborhood watch group

131
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,406
and tried to fight them.

132
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:38,878
But in just three months,

133
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:45,619
the five leaders of the neighborhood
watch died in strange ways one by one.

134
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:48,384
Who are the five who died?

135
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:53,163
Suleiman's son, Tung's father,
Minh's husband...

136
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:57,165
Mustafa's son,
and Shemel's father...

137
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:00,230
They didn't die.

138
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:05,209
They were murdered
by Peter Čapek.

139
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:11,284
I don't know why
you're watching Čapek.

140
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,448
But I will say this.

141
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:17,456
The one who's going
to kill Čapek...is me.

142
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:27,967
Just hold on, I think this one is
going to work much better.

143
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:29,302
It's hopeless.

144
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:30,893
No. If we try...

145
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:33,802
Even if you try hard,
impossible is still impossible.

146
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:40,275
I know. There's no way that we can
go on a trip to Turkey and Vietnam.

147
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:43,817
We don't have to go on a trip.

148
00:12:44,218 --> 00:12:46,949
We can continue to live
with Milan and Tung.

149
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:52,715
I'm done.

150
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,418
It'll fly this time.

151
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:56,923
There.

152
00:12:58,432 --> 00:12:59,399
See?

153
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:03,526
All right! It's flying!

154
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:04,900
That's amazing!

155
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:07,298
I guess it's impossible
to make one

156
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:09,001
that goes beyond that rooftop
like Mr. Milan can.

157
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:11,044
But it's flying, somewhat.

158
00:13:11,845 --> 00:13:13,210
Aren't you glad
you didn't give up?

159
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:14,307
- Yeah !
- Yeah!

160
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:19,183
You can't give up.

161
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:46,175
Where's my gun?

162
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:49,980
Where did you put the gun
that was in my drawer?

163
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,583
I've got a chance
to shoot Čapek.

164
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:55,288
I'm going now.

165
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:56,856
Give me back my gun.

166
00:13:57,391 --> 00:14:00,019
I can't let you do that.

167
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:05,559
I can't give you back your gun.

168
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:09,793
This is the gun that
was in your coat.

169
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:14,101
I want to do the job with a gun that
I've trained with and that I'm used to.

170
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,306
Give me my gun.

171
00:14:18,145 --> 00:14:22,548
You have a family now.
You shouldn't do that.

172
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,886
I've been following Čapek's
movements for a long time.

173
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:30,357
There is no better chance
to go after him than now.

174
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:34,555
Please stop, Mr. Milan.

175
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,294
I told you not to interfere.

176
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:42,125
Even if you take your revenge now,
the dead won't return.

177
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:45,299
Furthermore...
You have to think about the future.

178
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:47,935
You have no right
to tell me that.

179
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:51,244
Mr. Milan...

180
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:55,811
We're the same, Dr. Tenma.

181
00:14:58,018 --> 00:14:59,349
I looked you up.

182
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:06,726
If what you claim is true,
we're doing the same thing.

183
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:09,856
He wasn't always like this.

184
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:15,559
The man I knew...
wasn't a devil.

185
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,870
Peter Čapek and I are childhood
friends from the same county.

186
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:25,335
I invited him to this country!

187
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:29,973
What do you think
is across the border?

188
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:31,649
You shouldn't go there.

189
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:36,047
I know I shouldn't,
but do you know?

190
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:39,990
I heard it's a wonderful place
beyond the border.

191
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,328
There's a town where
it's bright all night.

192
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:45,627
Is that true, Peter?
Who did you hear that from?

193
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,662
Mr. Gregor.

194
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:49,433
He's an alcoholic.

195
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:51,803
They say that
across the border,

196
00:15:51,872 --> 00:15:55,399
there are things that can ruin a man
just like what happened to Mr. Gregor.

197
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:58,405
Something that
ruins people, huh?

198
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:00,380
I want to see that.

199
00:16:01,014 --> 00:16:02,743
You want to see
something like that?

200
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,276
Go!

201
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,244
It caught the wind!

202
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:08,465
You're really good, Milan!

203
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:09,854
It's flying! It's flying!

204
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,082
Amazing ! That could really
cross the border!

205
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:15,794
Look at what's on
the other side for us!

206
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:21,832
We were raised in a town on the
Czechoslovakian and Austrian border.

207
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,437
I was the son of a laborer.
He was the son of a bureaucrat.

208
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:29,435
But, oddly, we got along.

209
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:36,711
In 1989, when the Czechoslovakian
Communist regime collapsed,

210
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:39,480
the one who helped him defect. ..
was me.

211
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:46,551
The one that brought that devil
to this land was me.

212
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:01,063
I was worried about you during
the Soviet invasion last year.

213
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:04,536
Many people I knew were
dragged off, though.

214
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:07,074
But I'm here safe and sound.

215
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:08,641
How about you?

216
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:14,755
Me? I'm scraping by here and
there as a rookie dentist.

217
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:19,385
Milan's a dentist, huh? You were always
skillful with your hands, weren't you?

218
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:23,486
I want the kind of skills that get you
ahead in the world, like you.

219
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:28,595
Indeed, the reason I kept my position
even after the Soviets came in,

220
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,728
was probably because
I'm good at getting ahead.

221
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:35,367
I even had a lot of fun
during the "Prague Spring."

222
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,241
I even got to go to the West.

223
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:40,446
We talked about that when
we were young, didn't we?

224
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:42,746
We wondered what it was like
on the other side.

225
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,779
Did you get your answer?

226
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,045
Yes.

227
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,280
And?

228
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:51,087
There was nothing.
On this side or that side.

229
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:56,259
This country is wrong. But that doesn't
mean that the other side is right.

230
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,797
I see.

231
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:00,430
You said that I'm good at
getting ahead in the world.

232
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:04,062
But actually, there's someone
who saw something in me.

233
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:04,964
Oh?

234
00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:07,405
When you meet him,

235
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:12,105
he's so wonderful that you stop
caring about your present situation.

236
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:18,448
Just when I had concluded that
there was nothing in either country.

237
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,447
He showed me a light
I never knew existed.

238
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:24,883
He will bring forth
something entirely new.

239
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:29,493
And? What's he
going to bring forth?

240
00:18:30,097 --> 00:18:32,429
He'll bring forth? Well...

241
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:39,029
It could be something frightening.

242
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:47,576
Thinking back on it, something inside
of him might have started coming apart.

243
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:51,446
Give me back my gun.

244
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,781
Here. I'll give you
back your gun.

245
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,190
No. Mr. Milan...
you can't do this.

246
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:07,863
You can't stop me.
I'm going to kill him.

247
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:11,335
You have a family you're with,
right now!

248
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,736
And he's killed several members
from this family.

249
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:20,007
They were killed because
I brought him to this country.

250
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:23,443
Even my son...

251
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,666
After that attempt
to burn down this town...

252
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,320
there was one person the Turks
speak highly of, even to this day.

253
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:37,558
There was a Japanese man who
desperately tended to the wounded...

254
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:39,622
and tried his best
to put out the fires.

255
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:42,862
It's you isn't it, Dr. Tenma?

256
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,172
I believe in you.

257
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:49,271
I know what you're trying to do.

258
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:51,567
You're the same as me.

259
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:56,305
I'm going. It's time.

260
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:02,546
If I let this opportunity go,
I might never get another chance.

261
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,357
Mr. Milan!

262
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:10,028
Thank you for trying to stop me.

263
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:18,530
If I was in your shoes...
I doubt I could stop you.

264
00:20:45,832 --> 00:20:46,458
What's this?!

265
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,365
This is delicious!

266
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:59,676
Yeah. This is really good.

267
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:02,440
Japanese Oyakodon
is really delicious!

268
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:09,385
Is your leg all right?
Shall I help you, Dr. Tenma?

269
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,782
No. I'll be finished with
your portion soon, Mrs. Minh.

270
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,924
Milan sure is late.
I think he should be home soon.

271
00:21:17,764 --> 00:21:20,825
Oh. It's best to eat it
as soon as it's done.

272
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:24,028
- I'll make Mr. Milan's portion later.
<i>- Next in the news...</i>

273
00:21:24,104 --> 00:21:26,334
- Really? Then I'll leave you to it.
<i>- At about 11 A.M.</i>

274
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:29,341
<i>at the Roedelheim Convention Center
in Frankfurt,</i>

275
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:31,935
<i>there was an incident where a man
with a handgun, opened fire.</i>

276
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:36,847
<i>Police who were providing security for
the convention shot and killed the gunman.</i>

277
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:39,577
<i>There were
no other casualties.</i>

278
00:21:40,086 --> 00:21:42,851
<i>But due to the large number of important
figures present at the convention center,</i>

279
00:21:42,923 --> 00:21:44,982
<i>there was significant cause for
concern among the attendees.</i>

280
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:50,327
<i>The gunman's identity and
motives are still unknown.</i>

281
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:55,092
<i>We now turn to a clip of the incident
that happened to be caught on tape.</i>

282
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:59,696
Everyone says it's delicious.
It's a hit!

283
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:02,865
I wish Milan would
come home soon.

284
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:10,842
<i>And now the footage
of the incident.</i>

285
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:21,294
That man...

286
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:25,965
He's Red Rose Mansion's...
That's...

287
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:31,328
<i>Don't keep secrets from him.</i>
