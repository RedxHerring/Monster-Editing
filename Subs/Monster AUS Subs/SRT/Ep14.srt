1
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:09,763
My answer will be the same,
no matter how many times you come!

2
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:13,793
Mr. Boltzmann would never have
relations with a prostitute!

3
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:17,994
Nor did he murder one.
He's not involved!

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,499
Please leave. I'll have to take action
if you're persistent.

5
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:26,205
Take action? Are you going to
sue for defamation?

6
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:29,576
No... You're his secretary.
You wouldn't do that.

7
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:31,708
It would be bad if
Mr. Boltzmann's name

8
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:33,116
came up in this case,
wouldn't it?

9
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:36,721
Is that a threat?

10
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:38,125
Not at all.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,119
I just want to know the truth.

12
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:11,952
He's pretty tough.

13
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,489
It's what I'd expect of a big politician's
number one secretary.

14
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:16,682
No, I just need to pressure him
a little more.

15
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:19,751
But do you think that
a big-shot like Boltzmann

16
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:22,159
would lay his hands on that prostitute?

17
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,792
That victim was no ordinary prostitute.

18
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:28,312
The names of countless politicians
and businessmen

19
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:30,065
were traced back to her.

20
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:34,118
But there's only one person
who saw her at the hotel

21
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:35,667
that Boltzmann was staying at.

22
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:38,073
We can't be sure that there is
a relationship between the two

23
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:39,511
based on such
questionable information...

24
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:42,107
Has her client list been deciphered?

25
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,717
Well... The code is enumerated
in the floppy, so we haven't really...

26
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:49,685
I'll do it. Give me the floppy.

27
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:54,818
Oh...but inspector, aren't you
busy with other cases?

28
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:56,430
It doesn't matter. Give it to me.

29
00:02:57,365 --> 00:02:58,332
Umm...

30
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:01,167
I wanted to ask you earlier, but...

31
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:02,936
What is it?

32
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,529
When...do you sleep?

33
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,239
What does that have to do
with the case?

34
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,877
Huh?

35
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:11,477
It's an irrational question.

36
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:18,550
When are you going to
talk to him about that?

37
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,549
It doesn't matter when we tell him.

38
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:23,951
He never listens to us.

39
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:26,687
But you should do it
as soon as possible.

40
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,792
Hold on, you're talking too loud.

41
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,091
He's in his room.

42
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,198
Oh my, how unusual.

43
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:45,622
Lunge!

44
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:48,926
It seems that you're still investigating
Councilman Boltzmann's link

45
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,111
with the prostitute murder.

46
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:51,985
Is there a problem with that?

47
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,981
Yes, there's a big problem!

48
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:56,614
I'm being pressured by officials
from the Ministry of the interior!

49
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:59,718
Take care of it like
you usually do, Chief.

50
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:03,461
No. I can't back you up in this case.

51
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:05,562
Do something about it.

52
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:07,259
H-Hey, Lunge!

53
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:10,464
What'll happen if this investigation
was a mistake?!

54
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:15,176
You've had a wonderful career
until now.

55
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,077
There's no need to be
eager for success now.

56
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:19,671
Or is it something else?

57
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:22,483
Are you doing this...
in the name of justice?!

58
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:27,281
Eagerness for success...justice...
I have no interest in either.

59
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:34,892
A woman was killed.
I'm only interested in the culprit.

60
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,297
Lunge!

61
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:48,208
Umm, inspector Lunge,
you have a visitor.

62
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:50,521
I did it.

63
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:51,512
Huh?

64
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:53,780
I deciphered the client list.

65
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:56,711
I can convert all the names.

66
00:04:57,151 --> 00:05:00,121
O-Oh... Umm...
That woman is here again...

67
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:03,454
That woman...
Eva Heinemann...

68
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:07,052
Oh! Y-You can't come in here...

69
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:12,730
When will Tenma be arrested!

70
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,836
It seems like you've been
drinking quite a bit.

71
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,528
How could I not be drinking?!

72
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:22,068
I've already solved Dr. Tenma's case.

73
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:27,145
He says that it is all the work
of a man called Johan,

74
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:30,583
but Johan is one of his personalities.

75
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:33,754
If you think about it that way,
everything about

76
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:36,188
that seemingly illogical case
is explained logically.

77
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:40,953
All that's left is for the police
to capture him.

78
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:44,995
Does that mean that your job is over
once you've got a warrant?

79
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,700
There are a lot of things I'd like
to talk to him about in person.

80
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:52,896
Dr. Tenma...
he's a very interesting person.

81
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:58,501
But...the cases I need to tend to
are piling up on my desk.

82
00:05:59,947 --> 00:06:00,914
Excuse me.

83
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,345
You sure are persistent!

84
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:11,355
I keep telling you, that night
Mr. Boltzmann had an alibi...

85
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:15,560
An alibi? Of course.
That was the work of a pro.

86
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:18,623
Then what? Are you trying to say that

87
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:21,134
Mr. Boltzmann hired
a professional hit man?

88
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,360
How stupid!

89
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:25,971
I've deciphered the client list
of the woman who was killed.

90
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:29,940
The councilman's name was listed...

91
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:34,778
Even if his name was listed...
What would his motive be for murder?

92
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:40,183
Well... come to think if it,
that's about it.

93
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:43,147
I don't have time for this! Leave!

94
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:47,688
It really wasn't
satisfactory proof, was it?

95
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:51,187
Do you know of a publishing company
called Shellhourne?

96
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,113
They're a publishing company
that stays in business

97
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:59,004
by frequently publishing tell-all books
about famous people.

98
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:01,942
That company plays dirty.

99
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:05,303
They hire deceitful women
to form relationships

100
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:09,009
with famous people and have them
write about their arrangements...

101
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:12,919
You should be careful...

102
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:37,173
It was like a checkmate!

103
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:40,873
That secretary couldn't even respond.

104
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:42,774
I'm really surprised...

105
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:44,982
He never rests his mind or body
for an instant...

106
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,279
He really is superhuman.

107
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:51,281
Superhuman, huh?
He really might not be human.

108
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:52,459
Oh!

109
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:56,292
Ah, I see! It's checkmate
if I move there.

110
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,600
Hey, don't interrupt our game...
Oh!

111
00:08:00,468 --> 00:08:02,698
Don't waste your minds
on silly games.

112
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:05,749
The publishing company's president

113
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:08,037
simply confessed after
I startled him a little.

114
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:09,643
Get the report.

115
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:10,711
Y-Yes!
- Y-Yes!

116
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:17,713
WHAT...do you think this is?

117
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:20,721
It's that prostitute's notebook.

118
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,255
Her secret meetings
with a certain man

119
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:24,756
are written here in detail...

120
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:27,561
I don't know the man's name.

121
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:30,421
Aside from the fact that
his initial is "B"...

122
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:33,777
Also, Shellhourne Publishing

123
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,931
had a contract with the woman
to publish her life story.

124
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:42,786
Oh...yes, have you ever
been in contact

125
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,244
with a man named Yanker?

126
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:47,779
He's a professional hitman...

127
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:52,276
Leave...

128
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,189
Leave already!

129
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:08,925
We're leaving...

130
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:15,004
Father, you didn't notice that
I was pregnant, did you?

131
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:17,611
Are you going to the father
of your baby?

132
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:18,935
I'm going with her.

133
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:23,641
You didn't notice that I was
having an affair, did you?

134
00:09:31,592 --> 00:09:32,559
Yes?

135
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,960
Detective, it's me,
Boltzmann's secretary, Mintag.

136
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:38,764
I'll tell you everything. Please come!

137
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,062
Ah, I see. Thank you...

138
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:45,238
I'm going out.

139
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:47,670
Tell me the details later.

140
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,283
L-inspector!

141
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:06,652
What is this ruckus?

142
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,358
The secretary...he killed himself!

143
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,914
Mr. Boltzmann is innocent..."

144
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:40,919
This is the message
the secretary left behind.

145
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:46,600
Lunge...I'm passing this case over
to inspector Kaminski.

146
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:51,933
The Reichner Park and
President Galland Murder, as well...

147
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,106
Then what do I have?

148
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:04,946
I no longer...have anything for you.

149
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:35,309
It seems that you are
all that I have now...

150
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:44,023
U-Umm, inspector...
You have a visitor...

151
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:47,328
It's that woman again...
Eva Heinemann...

152
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,922
Let her in!

153
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:12,052
I had a great time, Eva.

154
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,656
When...can we meet again?

155
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:22,188
Well...I'll come after
my next business trip...

156
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,895
Aww, I don't want to return you
to your wife.

157
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:29,767
At any rate, I'll give you a call.

158
00:12:35,142 --> 00:12:36,906
You won't come back again.

159
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:41,911
I placed a handkerchief drenched with
perfume in your bag...

160
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:43,712
What a superficial man...

161
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,912
You were looking at me again,
weren't you?

162
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,136
Are you disturbed by the fact that

163
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,924
I'm always coming back
with a different man?

164
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:56,596
No...

165
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:58,928
You'd like to be invited as well,
wouldn't you?

166
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:00,427
N-No way...

167
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:01,768
How disgusting.

168
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:02,836
No way!

169
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:03,927
I just...

170
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:06,269
Oh my, it's become beautiful.

171
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,772
I love this garden...

172
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:15,879
I forget about the things I hate
when I gaze at my garden...

173
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:18,178
I'm glad you like it!

174
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:20,447
I'm going to plant mimosas here.

175
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:23,854
And over there, I'm going to make
a rose arch.

176
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:26,450
It'll be beautiful
once summer comes...

177
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:29,790
Someone like you
might be able to do it.

178
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:31,998
Huh?

179
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,098
Do you have the confidence
to make me happy?

180
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:39,806
Dad?

181
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:42,273
Hey, are you listening, Dad?

182
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:43,972
Hey, Dad!

183
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:45,211
Huh?

184
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:48,677
Oh... How is my cooking today?

185
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:51,880
You haven't heard anything I said...

186
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:56,285
That's why Mom went off
with another man...

187
00:13:56,757 --> 00:13:59,419
Oh! Sorry.

188
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:02,019
No... It's all right...

189
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:10,470
Actually...Colletta...

190
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:17,070
If...I had...umm...s-someone I liked...

191
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:20,437
Oh, no...n-nothing at all!

192
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:23,574
My cooking really isn't
any good today, either.

193
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:25,085
It's not bad.

194
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:27,087
I see, not bad, huh?

195
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:30,684
Sorry.

196
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,594
You're a gardener,
but I'm having you do this...

197
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:34,794
No, this is nothing.

198
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:38,191
My handyman kept asking
for time off and then quit.

199
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:40,796
I'll do anything I can...

200
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:46,966
How about dinner tonight?

201
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:50,005
Oh...well, o-okay...

202
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:02,847
Why are you nervous?

203
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:06,422
W-Well... I'm not used to
expensive restaurants like this...

204
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:09,326
If you want to be a man worthy of me,

205
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:11,262
you must be confident
wherever you go.

206
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:14,027
Just like when you're
working in the garden.

207
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:17,129
A-Ah...Th-That's right.

208
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:20,736
I really have confidence in myself
when I'm in the garden.

209
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:24,973
I feel so happy when I complete
a garden that I envisioned...

210
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:27,742
I like it best when I'm in the garden.

211
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,148
People who like gardens
can't be bad people.

212
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,976
You said that you liked that garden...

213
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:35,682
Are you trying to say that
I'm a good person?

214
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:37,190
Yes, of course.

215
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:40,293
But...

216
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:41,594
What is it?

217
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:45,062
No, umm... You...seem sad...

218
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:49,960
You, too.

219
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:51,271
Huh?

220
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,303
You're lonely, too, aren't you?

221
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:20,866
Oh... Sorry. My daughter's
probably worried...

222
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,937
Kenzo...

223
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:27,268
Kenzo...

224
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:42,385
It's almost Christmas, isn't it, Colletta?

225
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:45,283
Santa doesn't have to
push himself this year.

226
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:48,596
Hey, you don't have to
worry about that...

227
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:51,899
It's just lonely having a Christmas party
with just the two of us.

228
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:53,892
We don't have to do anything!

229
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:57,895
No, it may not be
just the two of us this year.

230
00:16:58,238 --> 00:16:59,205
Huh?

231
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:12,719
That man ruined my life.

232
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:15,312
S-Sorry...I was just
cleaning up a bit...

233
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,353
His name is Kenzo Tenma...

234
00:17:17,491 --> 00:17:19,152
He's my ex-fiancé...

235
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:21,755
Y-You're drinking again,
at this time of day...?

236
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:23,761
How can I not drink?!

237
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:26,429
I just went to the BKA

238
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,559
to see an investigator
by the name of Lunge!

239
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:32,067
That man sent me away.
How useless!

240
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:35,265
When are they going
to arrest Tenma?!

241
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:38,141
BKA? Arrest?

242
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:41,247
He killed my father and ran away!

243
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:44,284
He says that he was framed,
but who is he trying to fool?!

244
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,596
I was promised a good future as

245
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,384
the daughter of the director
of a large hospital!

246
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:51,383
My three failed marriages
are also his fault!

247
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,957
How can he say that
it's Johan's doing?!

248
00:17:54,628 --> 00:17:55,652
Take a look at this!

249
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:58,088
The kid with my father is Johan!

250
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:00,796
Do you think that this child
could kill my father?!

251
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,227
Is that what Tenma says?

252
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,995
It's a stupid excuse!

253
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
Did you show this photo to the police?

254
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:09,840
Of course not!

255
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:12,544
It might be important evidence!

256
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:14,245
Tenma's the one who did it!

257
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:17,946
Tenma has a split personality,
as investigator Lunge says!

258
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:25,554
Then...why do you still have
his pictures framed like this–?

259
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:31,058
In the depths of your heart,
you think that Tenma is innocent...

260
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:35,165
And you still...have feelings for him...

261
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:39,837
You watch too many soap operas.

262
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:41,240
Huh?

263
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:45,738
This man was the only man I've met
who was worthy of me.

264
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:48,545
He was an elite brain surgeon
who was called a genius...

265
00:18:48,815 --> 00:18:50,579
His position was good enough.

266
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:54,084
Best of all, this man never defied me!

267
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:58,788
He listened to my every request!
Yes, yes, yes!

268
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:00,994
He was a man who always said "yes"!

269
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:05,398
This man was supposed to make me
the happiest person in the world!

270
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:10,337
Could I...take his place?

271
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:15,908
I'll build gardens for you
for my entire life

272
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:17,808
if it would set your heart at ease...

273
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,269
Don't get optimistic just because
I slept with you once!

274
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:36,160
You were just something
to pass the time!

275
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,461
I was just teasing you.

276
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:40,064
You got carried away!

277
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,362
You fool. Who do you think you are?!

278
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:49,464
You...You really are a lonely person...

279
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:51,678
You too!

280
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:59,881
I'm having a party at my house
with my daughter on Christmas day.

281
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:01,882
You can come if you like.

282
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:14,560
This food is amazing!

283
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:16,462
Did you make all of this?

284
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:19,304
Yeah. I can't guarantee it'll taste good.

285
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:22,107
But isn't this a little too much
for the two of us?

286
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:23,506
Y-You think so?

287
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:24,811
Oh!

288
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:28,408
Mom's coming home!

289
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:32,586
That's it! Right?! isn't it?!

290
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:34,120
Colletta...

291
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,019
Mom came home!

292
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,943
Ch-Charlotte...

293
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:59,007
Mom...

294
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:01,672
I'm sorry, dear... I'm sorry...

295
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:50,389
Who cares about mimosas?!
Who cares about roses?!

296
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:52,132
Who cares about beautiful gardens?!

297
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:54,833
Who cares about the residence
of the ex-director of a large hospital?!

298
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:57,200
Let everything burn!

299
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,631
Everything!

300
00:22:16,623 --> 00:22:17,590
Welcome.

301
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:22,250
It seems like you finally want to
listen to me, inspector Lunge.

302
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:24,593
I just happened to have
my hands free.

303
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:27,296
This is the only man for me.

304
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:30,893
If I don't kill him...

305
00:22:31,004 --> 00:22:33,166
I can never be happy!
