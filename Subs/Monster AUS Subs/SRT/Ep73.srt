1
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:14,793
Everyone's dead.

2
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:21,934
The devil...

3
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:30,777
The devil has
come to this town!

4
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:39,626
Listen. I'm going in first.
You back me up from behind.

5
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:44,728
Our first priority is to
save Inspector Lunge.

6
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:45,892
Okay.

7
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:50,838
Dr. Tenma...

8
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:54,433
Wim ! Why did
you come here?!

9
00:00:57,145 --> 00:01:00,137
A woman came to see you.

10
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:01,682
A woman?

11
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:03,773
She went to
the Vampire's house.

12
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:07,084
She looked like the twins
in the pictures there.

13
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:10,152
Twins in the pictures?
Nina?!

14
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:16,722
So she's called Nina...

15
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:22,525
She's called Nina now, huh?

16
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:26,639
Yes. Nina Fortner.

17
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:34,847
Such a good name.

18
00:01:36,317 --> 00:01:38,081
Cherish your name.

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,779
That's what you always told me,
Mr. Poppe.

20
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:51,928
Say, have you seen my dad?

21
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:54,532
I've looked everywhere,
but I can't find him.

22
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:58,596
All right. Right now, I have important
business to attend to here.

23
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,075
Once I'm finished,
let's look for your father.

24
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,038
Dad hasn't killed anyone,
has he?

25
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:09,050
No, Wim. Your father
isn't that sort of person.

26
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:14,456
All right. Now hide in
that grocer's over there.

27
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:43,448
Take Wim and hide, quickly!

28
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:48,152
We finally meet, Dr. Tenma.

29
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:09,169
Let's die.

30
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:21,753
You and me together.

31
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:27,194
Let's die.

32
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:37,682
Wait, Nina!

33
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:41,654
I'm going to look for him...
Franz Bonaparta!

34
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,366
That time at Red Rose Mansion. ..
He told me...

35
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,906
<i>All right? Listen carefully.</i>

36
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:01,808
<i>Forget everything
you've just seen.</i>

37
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:08,046
<i>Run far away.</i>

38
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:10,057
<i>As far as you can...</i>

39
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:17,659
<i>People. .. can become
whatever they want to be.</i>

40
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:27,734
<i>You two are beautiful jewels.</i>

41
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,610
<i>And that's why you
mustn't become monsters.</i>

42
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:46,253
That's what he told me!

43
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:48,320
That's why I'm...

44
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:49,622
That's why...

45
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:00,799
Mr. Poppe!

46
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:04,509
Mr. Poppe?! Mr. Poppe?!

47
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:07,137
Franz.. .Bonaparta...

48
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,527
Roberto!

49
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:32,264
Wim! Run away!

50
00:07:58,466 --> 00:07:59,695
Show it to me.

51
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:05,002
The "scenery for
a doomsday."

52
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:08,408
You...

53
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,646
can't see it.

54
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:23,149
Wim...

55
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:24,884
Step back.

56
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,800
Dr. Tenma...

57
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:43,842
For you, all lives are equal.

58
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,843
That's why I
came back to life.

59
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:50,417
But you've realized it,
haven't you?

60
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:55,348
The only thing equal
for everyone...

61
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:57,985
is death.

62
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:13,503
You can see it.

63
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,378
My scenery for a doomsday.

64
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,086
No!

65
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,595
Dr. Tenma,
you mustn't shoot him!

66
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:17,304
Don't shoot.

67
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:27,981
I...

68
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,175
I forgive you.

69
00:10:34,622 --> 00:10:37,057
Even if we're the last
two people in the world.

70
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:39,951
I forgive you.

71
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:45,194
That's my...
From me to you...

72
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:46,433
No.

73
00:10:48,903 --> 00:10:50,871
There are things that
can't be taken back.

74
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,468
There's no going back.

75
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:57,941
Dr. Tenma is
going to shoot me.

76
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,275
Isn't that right, Dr. Tenma?

77
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,256
Isn't that right?

78
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:25,598
Stop!

79
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:27,073
Isn't that right?

80
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:31,708
Stop!

81
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:21,094
The devil...

82
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:26,900
The devil has come to this town
and killed everyone in it.

83
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,706
Wim...

84
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:53,122
S-Stop. My son... Sto...

85
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,770
W-What is that?!

86
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:11,510
A-A monster...

87
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,376
What is this?!

88
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:24,389
Stop! Get away!
Get away from my Wim!

89
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,308
<i>This is D-KMIF!</i>

90
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:43,574
<i>We've landed in
the west side of Ruhenheim!</i>

91
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:50,842
We've confirmed that
the east side is safe!

92
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:54,151
Assist the residents
immediately!

93
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:57,684
This is terrible.

94
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:00,217
Are there any survivors?

95
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:03,393
Our DNN reporting team,

96
00:14:03,464 --> 00:14:07,401
have finally entered the town through
the southern hills after much difficulty.

97
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:09,436
We have never heard
of such an event!

98
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,902
It appears that a massacre
nearly wiped out a whole town!

99
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:19,002
What happened in this quiet town
in Southern Germany?

100
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:26,178
Yes. Right now, we are holding
only one person as a suspect.

101
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:30,346
Herbert Knaup, 38 years old,
unemployed.

102
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:32,325
Dad...

103
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:37,090
Yes. He's confessed to a crime.
The shooting of a young man...

104
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:39,929
Dad shot him to save me!

105
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:45,136
It seems he is
a severe alcoholic.

106
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:48,470
He claims he shot because

107
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:54,072
there was a seven-headed monster
with many horns attacking his son.

108
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:57,046
- He was talking nonsense.
- Dad...

109
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:00,150
Dad...

110
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,153
Could you respond?

111
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:05,217
Damn it. I got cut off again.

112
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:10,156
It's as we told you.

113
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,930
Well... It doesn't make sense.

114
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:18,005
A young man named Johan
tried to annihilate this town

115
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:20,699
so that he could
commit suicide.

116
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:25,705
Dr. Gillen. ..could you explain it to us
in a way that we can understand?

117
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:28,973
It'll take a while
to tell you everything.

118
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:33,275
No, even if I did,
you still may not understand.

119
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:47,601
We've taken in an injured
police officer at the Hotel Versteck!

120
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:48,861
How is he?

121
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:54,206
His life is not in danger,
but he's only half conscious...

122
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:58,972
Crap! Isn't there a single officer
who can explain the situation to us?!

123
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,505
Right here.

124
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:04,377
I know everything.

125
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:05,977
Who are you?

126
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,945
Inspector Lunge of the BKA...

127
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:14,051
I don't have any identification on me
right now, but contact the BKA.

128
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:20,656
Roberto... He died huh?

129
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:25,603
He's the perpetrator who's
responsible for this incident.

130
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,505
I tried to stop him,
but he lost consciousness.

131
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:35,505
I moved away from him and
headed towards the stairs.

132
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,148
When I did, I heard his voice.

133
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:43,753
In the next instant, I took a blow to
the back of my head and passed out.

134
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:47,192
He said then...

135
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:51,991
"I still can't see
the end of the world."

136
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:57,328
Anyway, we'll discuss the details
after you get treated.

137
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:03,743
Don't cry.

138
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,408
It's all right now.

139
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,879
Excuse me.
I need to confirm your identity.

140
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,950
Henich of Erft Street.

141
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:14,081
This is my wife, Franca.

142
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:16,356
Do you have anything that
can prove your identities?

143
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,382
Yeah.

144
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:20,886
Huh?

145
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:25,297
What? What's wrong?

146
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:26,258
Well...

147
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:30,234
The lottery ticket's gone.

148
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:31,797
Huh?

149
00:17:32,472 --> 00:17:34,770
I-I'm sure I left it
in my pocket.

150
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,604
I'm going to look for it!

151
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,036
D-Dear...

152
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,574
I dropped it somewhere !
Somewhere!

153
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:42,380
Its all right, dear!

154
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:48,250
We don't need it.

155
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:53,425
It's more than enough
that we're still alive.

156
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,769
Umm... Your identification.

157
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,511
You can present it
to me afterwards.

158
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:23,655
Umm.. .
The remaining survivors...

159
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:27,087
Oh... There they are.

160
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,258
Excuse me...
I need to confirm your identity.

161
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:42,503
Go around to each house!

162
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:44,771
There still may be
survivors inside!

163
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:46,980
U-Umm...

164
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:48,207
What is it?

165
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:50,743
Actually...

166
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,987
What?!

167
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:12,027
Johan... He's still alive.

168
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:15,800
Well. ..
with that head wound...

169
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:19,169
Even if he had
the best neurosurgeon...

170
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:26,483
No. There is one.

171
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:30,990
Call him.

172
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:36,659
There's something
I'd like to ask you.

173
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:40,327
Could it be that you're...

174
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:46,034
There's no mistake.
You're the wanted–

175
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,803
Dr. Tenma!

176
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:53,243
You're Dr. Tenma,
aren't you?

177
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:55,780
Could you come with us?

178
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:57,873
Hey, wait a second!

179
00:19:58,185 --> 00:20:00,483
Inspector Lunge of the BKA
is asking for you.

180
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:01,447
Huh?!

181
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:08,156
He wanted us to tell you that
there's a patient who needs your help.

182
00:20:21,508 --> 00:20:23,602
My dad isn't a murderer!

183
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:28,179
Listen little boy, we need to
ask your father a few questions.

184
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:32,084
Dad... Dad tried to save me!

185
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:32,777
All right, c'mon.

186
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:36,885
Dad!

187
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:43,020
I want to forgive him.

188
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:46,827
I want to forgive.

189
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:52,496
Tenma, you aren't wrong.

190
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:54,941
What you did then...

191
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,305
and what you're going to do...

192
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:14,452
My dad isn't...

193
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:17,291
My dad isn't a murderer!

194
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:30,969
Let's begin the operation.
