1
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:12,158
Petra, open up.

2
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:13,501
Petra!

3
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:15,763
Today's the day I'm going to
take you in for a check up!

4
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:18,404
I keep telling you that it's
pointless to come here!

5
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:21,877
Who do you think
I'm coming here for?!

6
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:23,907
Nobody called you!

7
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:26,209
You stubborn, narrow-minded woman!

8
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:28,915
You're one to talk, you quack doctor!

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,318
I've never been to a doctor
since I was born, but I'm still healthy.

10
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:35,819
Now go away!

11
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:36,914
You stubborn...

12
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:38,922
Doctor!
Bad news–!

13
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:41,526
Dr. Schumann!

14
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:43,230
What's wrong?

15
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:46,930
Fink, the drunkard was hit
by a car on the highway!

16
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,040
So is he still conscious?

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,841
The man who brought him in
is treating him!

18
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,110
Huh?

19
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:59,111
It seems that some man who happened
to be passing by is examining him.

20
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:00,442
What?

21
00:01:08,423 --> 00:01:09,754
What is the meaning of this?

22
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:13,256
You were visiting homes,
so that man...

23
00:01:13,494 --> 00:01:14,757
You let him treat him?

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,662
Sorry. I tried to stop him,

25
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,564
but he said that he needed to
apply first aid

26
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:21,602
because there was a chance that
the patient would choke...

27
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:24,601
Who is he?!

28
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:28,000
Who knows?
He left without saying his name.

29
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:31,212
Oh...he wrote something
on the medical chart...

30
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,929
"The patient has no money."

31
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:43,083
"He kept repeating not to
take him to a doctor."

32
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,223
"Please take this money
as his doctor's fee"?

33
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:48,095
Damn!

34
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:49,320
Who does he think he is?

35
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:52,028
Doctor, where are you going?

36
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:53,928
What does he look like?!

37
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:57,931
He was an Asian man with a boy...

38
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:03,576
Umm, what about Fink's treatment?

39
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:05,780
Just keep him in bed!

40
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,439
B-But...the man only
applied first aid...

41
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:11,795
That was not first aid...

42
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:12,786
Huh?

43
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,850
His treatment was complete.

44
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,617
Say, Dieter...

45
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:55,123
It's really a problem if you follow me.

46
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,418
I can't stay in one place.

47
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:03,462
You can't go to school.
You can't make any friends.

48
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:05,160
I have a friend.

49
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:06,734
Who?

50
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:07,868
Tenma.

51
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:11,033
Listen, Dieter.

52
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,175
Was it you?

53
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:17,467
You're the one who
came to my clinic

54
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:18,875
and did unnecessary things,
aren't you?

55
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:20,180
Huh?

56
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:21,839
Don't underestimate me!

57
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,950
I know that Fink is a broke alcoholic.

58
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,779
I had no intention of
charging him for treatment.

59
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,386
Oh...well...

60
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:34,404
You're probably some elite
from a first-rate hospital

61
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:36,590
trying to show some compassion
while on vacation.

62
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:38,590
You're probably full of yourself.

63
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,167
Hey.
- Welcome.

64
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:42,464
Let's go, Dieter!
- Are you busy?

65
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:44,471
Yeah.
- Hey!

66
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,866
Listen to what I have to say!

67
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:48,408
I'm very sorry.

68
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:50,809
We're in a hurry...

69
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:54,277
Fink got into a hit-and-run.

70
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:56,210
Fink, the drunkard?

71
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,384
Yeah.

72
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:59,213
We're looking for witnesses.

73
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,748
Ah... That's a tough task.

74
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,460
Hey, Dr. Schumann.

75
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:09,755
How is Fink's condition?

76
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:13,732
His life's not in danger. I'm more
worried about his alcoholism.

77
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:16,470
And you are?

78
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:17,834
Well, I'm...

79
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:22,442
Dr. Chan.

80
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,370
An underclassman from college.

81
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:28,177
He's visiting this village
during his vacation.

82
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:31,846
Dr. Chan? Have we met somewhere?

83
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,185
He treated Fink for me
while I was visiting homes...

84
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:40,184
That aside, where do you think I was?

85
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:43,995
At Petra's house...
your mother, Heinz.

86
00:05:44,232 --> 00:05:45,199
Mom?

87
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,900
Tell her to come to the clinic.

88
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:50,698
We may need to treat her
as soon as possible.

89
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:52,372
That's impossible.

90
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:55,401
That stubborn woman
won't listen to anyone.

91
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:57,871
Don't act as if it's not your problem.

92
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:01,905
It's all right. Mom won't die that easily.

93
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,960
Wha–?!

94
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:08,548
Besides, she raised me this far.
I don't think she has any regrets.

95
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:09,823
What?!

96
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:10,924
Hey, wait!

97
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,453
Petra's life has just begun!

98
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:21,767
Why did you lie?

99
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:25,666
That was for saving Fink.

100
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:29,474
He would have died if it wasn't
for your swift treatment.

101
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,437
Thank you very much.

102
00:06:33,814 --> 00:06:36,078
You turned so pale
when you saw the police...

103
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:37,584
You...

104
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:40,297
Oh well,

105
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:43,484
at least it's obvious that you're not
an elite doctor from a first-rate hospital.

106
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:48,484
Thank you very much.
I don't know how to repay you.

107
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,197
Repay me, huh?

108
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,688
Then help me out a bit.

109
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:54,201
Huh?

110
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:57,395
Ow ow ow...

111
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,337
Your splint is misaligned.

112
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,640
This may hurt a bit,
but please be patient.

113
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:05,436
Ow...

114
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:10,913
Now it should be all right.

115
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:15,852
You can probably take it off
after two more weeks.

116
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,657
Doctor, I made some good cider.

117
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:20,652
Want a drink?

118
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:22,827
What are you talking about?
You're hurt.

119
00:07:23,397 --> 00:07:25,866
I'll drink with you all night
once you've healed.

120
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:32,731
Progress is good. Five days
and you can go back to the fields.

121
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:34,738
Aren't you glad, Schone?

122
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:38,875
Doctor, take some potatoes.
This year's crop is good.

123
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:42,178
Next time, I'll come with a truck
and take a whole mountain of them.

124
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,353
Thank you.
My specialty is internal medicine.

125
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:52,887
I do what I can outside my specialty...

126
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:56,093
But things don't go very well
when I'm by myself.

127
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,656
This is wonderful.

128
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:01,333
Yeah. There's nothing here,
but it's a peaceful village.

129
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:03,298
No, I didn't mean that...

130
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:07,436
You're loved by the people here...

131
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:11,042
And you really love them too...

132
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:17,345
Love, huh?
I lost feelings like that a long time ago.

133
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:20,543
I'm just doing my job.

134
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,924
Now, come with me
to just one more house.

135
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:26,858
This one is difficult.

136
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:31,658
You really are persistent, aren't you?!

137
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,763
Yeah! I'll keep coming back!

138
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:36,680
It'll be the same no matter
how many times you come!

139
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:37,781
Just leave!

140
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:38,863
You quack doctor!

141
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:43,076
See?

142
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:46,242
She's the mother
of that police officer earlier...

143
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:49,346
She fell sick while farming.

144
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:52,649
I tried to get her to my clinic,
but on the way there

145
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,951
she said that she's fine
and went back home.

146
00:08:56,323 --> 00:08:57,449
That's worrisome.

147
00:08:58,426 --> 00:08:59,393
Yeah...

148
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:01,822
Shall I try to reason with her?

149
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,192
It'll probably be the same.

150
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:06,791
Are you still loitering there?!

151
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:09,334
I can loiter wherever I want!

152
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,103
Calm down. She'll never come out
if you yell like that.

153
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:18,942
I'm going to get you out. I'm not going
to lose my reason for living!

154
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:20,313
Huh?!

155
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:27,011
N-No, I just meant that I wouldn't
have anyone to fight with anymore.

156
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:31,257
A-Also, I wouldn't be able to eat
her goulash anymore...

157
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,859
Mister, your face is red.

158
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:35,726
What did you say?! You brat!

159
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:42,458
Open up, Mrs. Petra.

160
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:45,338
What's this? A different doctor now?

161
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:47,672
It's useless to talk to
that stubborn woman.

162
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,075
Why do you hate doctors?

163
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:52,575
Why? Well, humph!

164
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:54,773
They fiddle around
with peoples' bodies

165
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:57,579
and think that they're gods
or something!

166
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:04,388
God, huh? Sometimes I think that
it would be great if we were.

167
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:09,292
We try our best, but no matter what,
we make mistakes.

168
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:14,000
I wish that I could heal people
perfectly like God.

169
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:21,365
I'm always trembling inside
whenever I see my patients.

170
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,703
Please. At least let me see your face.

171
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:45,498
This smell... You're making goulash,
aren't you?

172
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:48,599
Who are you? Do you like goulash?

173
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:54,697
Yes. But it seems that Dr. Schumann
especially loves your goulash.

174
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:59,936
That's news to me. He always eats it
without a word whenever I make it...

175
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,138
He's self-conscious.

176
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:03,681
This looks really delicious!

177
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:06,853
Jeez...
My shoulders are stiff,

178
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:09,390
but it looks like
I have to prepare dinner...

179
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,057
Stiff shoulders?

180
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:14,486
Mrs. Petra, can you put
your chin to your chest?

181
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:17,991
Of course I can.

182
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,868
See? Ow ow ow...

183
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:22,369
Excuse me...

184
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:27,200
<i>Four fingers fit...</i>

185
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,510
What's that? Some kind of prayer?

186
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,672
No...nothing...

187
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:35,982
How is she?

188
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,412
It's probably...
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

189
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,087
What?!

190
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:43,924
Petra!

191
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,185
Here's the fax of the arrest warrant
for the murder suspect.

192
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:49,329
Make copies of it.

193
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:51,295
Is your mom okay?

194
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:52,931
I heard that she collapsed
three days ago.

195
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,933
She's all right. She wouldn't die
even if you killed her.

196
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,479
It's been 72 hours
since the first stroke...

197
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:09,073
We can make it.
We've got to operate immediately!

198
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:11,280
I don't know if a helicopter
can make it if we call for one.

199
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,280
Can you do it?

200
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:15,653
Huh?
- Please,

201
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:20,285
perform the operation
if you can... If not...I...

202
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:25,165
It'll be my fault again for
losing another person I love.

203
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:35,098
You're sure that it's Kenzo Tenma?!

204
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:36,504
Yes.
- All right.

205
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,303
He might not have gone far!

206
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:39,504
Set up a barrier along the highway!

207
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:42,214
It'll be great if we catch him, Heinz.

208
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:43,683
Y-Yes!

209
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,412
Everyone, emergency deployment!

210
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:50,020
I did it! I can get a promotion
if things go well...

211
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:52,221
Hey, Heinz, you have a call!

212
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:59,729
Yes! This is Heinz...
Oh, hello, Nurse...

213
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,032
Mom collapsed again?!

214
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:08,965
If only I had forced her to
get a check up at a national hospital

215
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:10,441
after the first stroke...

216
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:14,877
You're the only one
I can count on, Dr. Tenma!

217
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:21,584
It's as I thought. It's an aneurysm
of the middle cerebral artery.

218
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:24,801
Damn it!
We don't have a surgical microscope

219
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,156
or a craniotome here...

220
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:29,694
I can try open surgery as long as
I have an aneurysm clip.

221
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:32,857
But it's too difficult even for you.

222
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,897
We've got to try.

223
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:39,769
She may not live the next time
the cranial aneurysm ruptures...

224
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:44,105
It's my fault that
this happened again...

225
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:46,476
What's wrong, Dr. Schumann?

226
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:49,278
You single-handedly took care of
the patients of this village.

227
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,408
It's not like you.

228
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:54,016
I don't know what happened
in the past, but...

229
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:56,822
We have to try our best
for the patient before us...

230
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:59,026
That is all we can do as doctors.

231
00:14:00,594 --> 00:14:01,561
Yeah...

232
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:12,534
Hey, boy, is Dr. Schumann inside?

233
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,465
Yes, he's operating.

234
00:14:14,908 --> 00:14:16,433
Operating on my mom?

235
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,742
They're operating at this clinic
rather than taking her

236
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:19,870
to a hospital in town?

237
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:22,549
It's all right, Tenma is here.

238
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:24,084
Tenma, you say?!

239
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:26,545
How's her blood pressure and pulse?

240
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:29,984
Blood pressure 126/84.

241
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:32,153
Pulse 88.

242
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:38,855
Amazing... He opened her head
so fast with just a wire saw.

243
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:41,196
He doesn't even have a craniotome.

244
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:44,995
What are you doing?!

245
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,903
As you can see, we are
operating on your mother!

246
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:49,505
What are you doing with that gun?!

247
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:51,169
Raise your hands, Tenma!

248
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:52,879
Tenma!

249
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:55,907
We're in the middle of an operation!
Are you trying to kill your mother?!

250
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,781
He's trying to kill her!

251
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:01,611
Tenma is a murder suspect
that's been on the run!

252
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:02,956
What?!

253
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:06,469
He killed a man in Heidelberg.
He's even suspected of

254
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:08,552
the serial killing of
middle-aged couples.

255
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:11,863
I never thought that I'd find him here.

256
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:15,964
Leave it to Mom.
She saw an opportunity for me.

257
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:18,067
Now, raise your hands.

258
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:19,339
If you don't, I'll shoot!

259
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:20,563
Get out of here!

260
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:24,173
This is a sterile operating room!

261
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:26,070
You're bringing in germs!

262
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,483
Your mother could die
from meningitis if you spread it!

263
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:32,882
Then quickly stop the operation!

264
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,854
Do you really want your mom to die?

265
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:39,556
Your mother has
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

266
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:41,887
She first collapsed three days ago.

267
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,591
If we don't deal with it now
it'll be too late.

268
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:49,391
Now, get out!

269
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:51,502
You think you've got a hostage?!

270
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:55,106
You're planning to use my mom
as a hostage and run away from here!

271
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:57,572
Aneurysm clip and forceps...

272
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,437
Aneurysm clip and forceps!

273
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:03,049
Yes.

274
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:04,851
That's my mom!

275
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:07,050
I won't let anyone touch her!

276
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:09,855
That's right. Petra is your mother.

277
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,956
But what have you done for her
in the past five years?

278
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:17,362
Have you visited her even once
since you left the town?

279
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:20,260
What have you ever done
for your mother

280
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,358
after she raised you this far?

281
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:26,565
Listen, people who are dear to us
will pass away some day.

282
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:31,368
Do you remember the taste of
your mother's goulash?

283
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:35,475
Even now, Petra makes portions
for you out of habit.

284
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:41,378
I eat what's left over. It's delicious!
That taste is superb!

285
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:46,490
Dr. Tenma is desperately fighting
to save your mom.

286
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:48,588
If you want to eat that goulash again...

287
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:50,192
Get out!

288
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:56,996
See? Tenma is here, so it's all right.

289
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:06,742
Blood pressure 140/86. Pulse 82.

290
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:08,806
Vital signs are stable.

291
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:11,344
Pionier, you should get some rest.

292
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:13,344
But Doctor...

293
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:16,013
I'm all right. Get some rest.

294
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:17,854
Yes, then...

295
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:19,325
Good work.

296
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:21,953
Dr. Tenma, you get some rest, too.

297
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:24,124
I'm all right, too.

298
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:27,824
You performed a difficult operation
that lasted three hours.

299
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,968
I want to stay alert and watch her...

300
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:35,372
So that you can propose to Mrs. Petra
when she gets better.

301
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,535
What do you mean by "propose"?

302
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:42,744
You weren't sleeping?

303
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:46,079
I can't sleep.
Not until I take him away!

304
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:48,852
Besides that, what do you mean?

305
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:50,900
You're not going to propose
to my mom, are you?

306
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:54,360
Don't be foolish! Don't be foolish...

307
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:01,729
I'm...not someone who can
propose to anyone...

308
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:05,728
When I was
at the university hospital...

309
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,936
I never cared about talking
to my patients.

310
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:12,343
I only thought of how I could
raise my position in the hospital...

311
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,914
I got into the director's faction
and wrote papers for the director.

312
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:18,351
Finally...

313
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:21,046
I even married the director's daughter.

314
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:23,950
I pushed forward along
the path of success even after that.

315
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:26,349
I never paid any attention to my wife.

316
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:30,173
Yes. If I was a real doctor,

317
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:33,861
I would have noticed
when I had seen her face.

318
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:37,434
For a long time,
my wife had symptoms

319
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:39,063
which mimicked the common cold.

320
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:42,769
I would have noticed
if I were watching closely...

321
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,439
It was liver failure...

322
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,945
When she took her last breath...

323
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:52,686
<i>You finally... paid attention to me...</i>

324
00:18:56,323 --> 00:18:59,588
I have no right to love anyone.

325
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:03,020
That's not true.

326
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:05,998
You've been paying attention.

327
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,699
You've been paying attention
to the people of this town.

328
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:12,428
Petra was saved because
you were paying attention.

329
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:30,751
Do you still plan on taking
this man away?

330
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:34,760
He's the man who struggled
to save your mother.

331
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:36,926
Do you still think he's a murderer?

332
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:43,469
Heinz!

333
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:46,066
This is Heinz. Get me the chief.

334
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:51,369
Chief, I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

335
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:54,338
Cancel the barrier.

336
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:59,252
The man I saw wasn't Tenma.
He was Dr. Chan.

337
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,984
I made the mistake
because he was Asian...

338
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:05,155
I'm very sorry.

339
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:14,197
The doctor of the national hospital
was sure surprised.

340
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,696
He probably never thought that

341
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:20,262
he would see such amazing treatment
from a clinic in the countryside.

342
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,705
Doctor!

343
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,304
Are you going to let
that young doctor go?

344
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:29,710
I was going to make him
something to eat, but he went off.

345
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:36,122
Tenma!

346
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:41,192
Don't go, this village is safe.

347
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:42,522
There's no need to run away!

348
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:45,390
Dr. Schumann.

349
00:20:45,832 --> 00:20:48,597
Dieter, you like it here, don't you?

350
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:53,130
I see.
This village may be good for Dieter.

351
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:58,302
Not only for Dieter. This village
can protect you from the police.

352
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:03,646
Take care of the people here with me.

353
00:21:04,184 --> 00:21:06,152
This village needs you.

354
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:10,588
But I have to go.

355
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:11,991
Why?!

356
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:14,958
Please take care of Dieter.

357
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:17,688
Tenma, I'm going with you!

358
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,763
If you stay here,
you can save the lives

359
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,268
of countless people in this area!

360
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:24,493
Let's do this together!

361
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,006
Save countless lives...

362
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,906
I...have to kill a man.

363
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:36,182
What?

364
00:21:39,252 --> 00:21:40,219
Tenma!

365
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:42,019
What do you mean, Tenma?!

366
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:44,221
There's no way you can do
such a thing!

367
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:47,921
You try so desperately to save
peoples' lives!

368
00:21:49,062 --> 00:21:50,086
He's going...

369
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:53,723
Tenma's going no matter
what you say...

370
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:01,970
Go, Dieter.

371
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:03,543
Huh?

372
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,873
Tenma won't lose his way
if you're with him.

373
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:09,573
Watch Tenma carefully.
