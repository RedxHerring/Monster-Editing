1
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:14,165
Barbara...would you like
a Moscow Mule?

2
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,026
Thank you, Michael.

3
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:16,963
Okay.

4
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:20,135
Fritz, I have juice for you.

5
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:26,510
Fritz, thank your father.

6
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:29,146
Thank you, old man.

7
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:30,641
Fritz!!

8
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,647
It can't be helped.
He'll get used to me eventually.

9
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:38,355
The antique business I just started
will also take off eventually.

10
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:41,760
But it was just so sudden for me.

11
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:42,622
Huh?

12
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,366
I suddenly get to live in
such a wonderful home,

13
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:50,599
and my sweet husband
makes delicious cocktails for me.

14
00:00:57,245 --> 00:01:00,044
Say, did you see something?

15
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:00,907
Huh?

16
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,474
The house next door.

17
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:05,076
Sometimes I get the feeling
that someone is watching us

18
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:06,676
from the window of the second floor...

19
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:09,789
No. That house is empty, isn't it?

20
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:11,917
I know, but...

21
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:14,992
Well, Mrs. Daughtry,
from across the street,

22
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:16,758
told me something...

23
00:01:17,198 --> 00:01:17,824
What did she tell you?

24
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:23,195
Twenty years ago, a couple
was brutally murdered next door.

25
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:27,668
She said that ghosts have
been seen in that house.

26
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:32,638
What's wrong, Michael?

27
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:33,573
Huh?

28
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:37,878
Don't tell me that
you believe that story.

29
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:40,755
O-Of course not.

30
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:45,292
Going out?

31
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:46,019
Yeah.

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,227
I'll get the car.

33
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:48,456
Oh... No, that's all right.

34
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,091
I think it would be good for
just the three of us to go out together.

35
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,692
We probably don't need a bodyguard.

36
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:55,869
I see...

37
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:59,664
Well, Fritz will probably warm up
to you faster that way.

38
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:02,002
Exactly. That's the plan.

39
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:04,906
Good luck, Dad.

40
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,384
Well, shall we get going?

41
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,208
Detective, what are the results
of the investigation?

42
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:48,342
First off, regarding Dr. Tenma...

43
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:53,944
The police are chasing him as
a suspect in the Fortner murder case.

44
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:56,650
But they couldn't find out
anything about him.

45
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,421
When Dr. Tenma was
summoned by the police,

46
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:06,161
he said that a boy whose life
he saved ten years ago

47
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,760
had murdered the director of
Eisler Memorial Hospital

48
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:10,998
and three others, and had run away...

49
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:12,940
The boy's name is Johan.

50
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:19,547
Later, the adult Johan murdered
someone right in front of Dr. Tenma.

51
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:22,881
Next is Nina Fortner...

52
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,376
She was the daughter of
the murdered couple.

53
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,188
Her whereabouts are also unknown.

54
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:32,622
Now, as for Mr. Mesner...

55
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:36,159
I followed him to Frankfurt.

56
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,360
What is he doing now?

57
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,191
He's dead.

58
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:44,031
He was brutally stabbed
two months ago.

59
00:04:44,438 --> 00:04:48,272
The official line is that
he was killed in a drug dispute.

60
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:54,941
Mesner was my partner
when I was a police officer.

61
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,081
I see...

62
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:02,550
Mr. Mesner was dismissed from
the police for narcotics possession.

63
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,018
A man called "The Baby" saved him.

64
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:10,424
He's the boss of
an extreme right-wing organization.

65
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:11,823
What does that
have to do with anything?

66
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,558
Last winter, a group of people tried to
set fire to Frankfurt's Turkish district.

67
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:16,831
Remember?

68
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:20,469
There are rumors that
"The Baby" was the ringleader.

69
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:24,703
An Asian man stopped the fire.

70
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,411
His name was Tenma.

71
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:30,945
He might be Dr. Tenma...

72
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:35,265
One more thing. Rumor has it that
"The Baby" started the fires

73
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:42,093
to welcome a certain young man
to his organization as it's leader.

74
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:43,354
A certain young man?

75
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:48,333
What was the name of the boy
who Tenma saved ten years ago?

76
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:52,732
Johan...

77
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:56,200
The youth who "The Baby" tried to

78
00:05:56,277 --> 00:06:00,976
install as his organization's leader
is also called Johan.

79
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:56,329
Ah...

80
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,731
So you're coming at me that way...

81
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:05,677
Say, Roberto, my life is like
this chess piece, don't you think?

82
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,109
Is something bothering you?

83
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:11,384
Back then...

84
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,985
I was always a loser in life.
Until I got that phone call.

85
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:22,155
I was a detective who sold
confiscated drugs on the black market

86
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:23,993
with my partner Mesner.

87
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:27,299
The caller knew everything...

88
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:31,800
We just had to kill a certain couple
if we wanted him to keep quiet.

89
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:37,000
We'd be saved if we killed
the Fortners in Heidelberg!

90
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,378
There was one more person
that night...

91
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,981
A newspaper journalist, or something,
was also in the house.

92
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,552
Mesner and I
killed all three of them.

93
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,686
After that, we were given
a large sum of money.

94
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:58,755
When I left the police force,
I was picked up by the Syndicate.

95
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:02,029
I was even given a good post.

96
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:05,263
The money I made
was easily laundered...

97
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:09,367
Then you met your wife
and went straight.

98
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:14,042
How did I get out of
that organization so easily?

99
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:17,279
Who made that phone call?

100
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:20,986
Who gave me
that large sum of money?

101
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:24,417
Who's controlling my life?

102
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:32,163
Roberto, I'm grateful to you
for protecting me all this time...

103
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,666
Then could you take back
that last move?

104
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:36,629
Huh?

105
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:44,337
That's something that I can't do.

106
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:45,846
That's harsh.

107
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:52,284
I'll be off now.

108
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,654
Okay. Be careful.

109
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,148
Buy me a toy!!

110
00:08:57,658 --> 00:08:59,854
Say goodbye to your father, Fritz.

111
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:01,561
It's pointless.

112
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:03,726
All he can think about are toys...

113
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:05,496
Goodbye, Dad...

114
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:09,403
Goodbye!

115
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:27,654
Roberto, were there any calls
from the detective?

116
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:29,547
He should have come by now...

117
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:31,158
Roberto!

118
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:41,429
Roberto, it's the detective!!

119
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:43,194
Come quickly!

120
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:44,438
Roberto!

121
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:48,974
Y-Y-You're...

122
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:52,870
I'm the daughter of the Fortners,
the couple you killed.

123
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:54,671
Did you kill him?

124
00:09:55,516 --> 00:09:56,483
Roberto!

125
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:59,980
Your bodyguard, Roberto,
was the one who killed that man!

126
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:02,489
Roberto did this?

127
00:10:02,723 --> 00:10:04,987
I saw everything from
the house next door!

128
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,317
That's impossible!

129
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,990
Roberto is a friend I can trust.

130
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,123
W-What about you?

131
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:14,824
You came to get revenge on me!

132
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:16,599
R-Roberto!

133
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:17,938
Roberto...

134
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,278
I'm taking this bag.

135
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:30,047
You can stay here if you want to.

136
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:33,576
You have someone you can trust.

137
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:44,665
What's wrong, Mr. Muller?

138
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:56,938
Mr. Muller?

139
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:20,559
Drive out of here, quickly!
Now!!

140
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:37,649
You've been watching me
all this time from

141
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,083
the house next door, haven't you?

142
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:41,455
What were you planning to
do with me?

143
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:44,321
I hate you from
the bottom of my heart.

144
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:46,523
I want to kill you!

145
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,729
I-I was forced to do it.

146
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,000
He said that he'd reveal that I was
selling narcotics on the black market

147
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,538
if I didn't kill your parents...

148
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:01,766
So...I had to team up with Mesner...

149
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,700
We had to do it!

150
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:09,780
You had to...?

151
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:12,985
You...had to?!

152
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:16,148
Stop!

153
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,687
Stop the car!!

154
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,323
They were wonderful people...

155
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:29,932
They were really wonderful...

156
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:39,204
My mother and father loved me
from the bottom of their hearts.

157
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:41,172
W-Wait!

158
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,908
I'm not even their real daughter.

159
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:51,046
My mother and father...
really...really...

160
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:52,621
S-Stop...

161
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:54,054
Please stop–!!

162
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:57,956
But they were killed by
a scoundrel like you!!

163
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:07,841
Barbara... Fritz...

164
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:13,138
Barbara... Fritz...

165
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:28,754
<i>Come here.</i>

166
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,194
Barbara... Fritz...

167
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:35,869
What?

168
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:37,397
What are you talking about?

169
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:39,172
What the hell?!

170
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:49,449
So this is what it's like to be killed...

171
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:57,580
Fritz called me Dad for the first time...

172
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,555
I don't want to lose them.

173
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,861
I've got things I don't want to lose...

174
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,600
Barbara... Fritz...

175
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:13,971
Düsseldorf...every morning
at 8:30 at that cafe.

176
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:18,242
When I joined the Syndicate,

177
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:22,306
my boss ordered me to pose as
a businessman each morning.

178
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,751
Every morning, a mother
passed by with her child.

179
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:31,449
It was my only connection
with normal life.

180
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,124
<i>H-Hey 'morning.</i>

181
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:38,126
<i>Good morning.</i>

182
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,861
What did you ask
your detective to do?

183
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:47,340
Find you and Tenma...

184
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:51,836
And find information about Mesner,
my former police partner.

185
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:53,880
But Mesner is dead.

186
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:54,840
Huh?

187
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:56,275
He was murdered.

188
00:14:57,084 --> 00:15:00,145
I hired an investigator
who was familiar with the case.

189
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:02,949
I had a call from
the detective last night...

190
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:06,087
<i>Things are getting strange.</i>

191
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:07,691
- Strange?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

192
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:10,355
<i>Mr. Mesner was
already a junkie.</i>

193
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:13,833
<i>He wasn't someone who would get
in a dispute with the Syndicate.</i>

194
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:19,033
<i>One more thing. The culprit wasn't
from Frankfurt's organization,</i>

195
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:20,232
<i>but from Düsseldorf...</i>

196
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:21,297
Düsseldorf?

197
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,572
<i>Well...I'll tell you
the rest of the details in person.</i>

198
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:25,604
Here it is.

199
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:27,609
A draft of the report...

200
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,580
"The culprit of...the Mesner case."

201
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:32,882
"Who is...Roberto?"

202
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:36,453
Do you know what this means?

203
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:46,392
Hello?

204
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,533
<i>I want you to return my bag.</i>

205
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:49,965
R-Roberto?!

206
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:54,437
<i>Your wife and Fritz
are with me right now.</i>

207
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,440
W-What did you say? Hey!

208
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:58,740
Put my wife on the phone!

209
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:03,574
<i>You should come back quickly
to your "happy home"...</i>

210
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:18,891
A gun...

211
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:20,092
Huh?

212
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:22,630
Could you lend me a gun?

213
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,074
You can only use
that gun at short range.

214
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,275
There are only four shots...

215
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:33,739
That's good enough.
I was once a police officer.

216
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:34,740
Be careful!

217
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:40,283
If I die, I can't tell
the police the truth...right?

218
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,880
That's right. You can't die.

219
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:46,016
I'll cover you from
the empty house next door!

220
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:05,311
Dad!!

221
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:07,213
F-Fritz...

222
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:09,739
Dad, look, it's a fishing pole!

223
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:14,884
He absolutely insisted on
going fishing with his father.

224
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:16,389
Barbara...

225
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,056
W-Where's Roberto?

226
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:21,524
Uh...Oh yeah.

227
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:24,830
Some of his friends from
the security company have come by.

228
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:27,091
It seems like something happened
while we were out.

229
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:28,127
Friends?

230
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:32,103
Don't worry. Nobody was hurt.

231
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,669
Oh, Roberto, Michael's come home.

232
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:41,307
Don't worry. A window was broken.

233
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:43,943
One of the neighborhood kids
was probably causing trouble.

234
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:46,352
There's nothing to worry about.

235
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:56,392
W-Where's the body?!

236
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,964
What happened to
the detective's body?

237
00:17:59,032 --> 00:17:59,055
It was right here!

238
00:17:59,132 --> 00:18:01,157
There wasn't anything here.

239
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:06,535
Roberto! Who...Who are you?

240
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,299
Your wife and Fritz are coming.

241
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,236
Now then, don't
make things complicated.

242
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:13,572
Come on...

243
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:21,982
Good. Nothing happened today.

244
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:25,082
Today was a peaceful day.

245
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:26,887
It will continue to be peaceful.

246
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:31,991
Nina...

247
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:36,528
Nina!

248
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:39,606
Nina...

249
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:43,642
She was a beautiful girl, wasn't she?

250
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:46,741
Nina... What did you do to Nina?

251
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,139
We are treating her well.

252
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:52,578
She is an important guest
to a certain individual.

253
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,987
A certain individual?

254
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:57,751
<i>The name of that young man
is also Johan.</i>

255
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,721
Johan! Johan! Johan!

256
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:02,618
Who is Johan?!

257
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,255
Who are you guys?!

258
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:09,231
You want to live a happy life
with your wife and Fritz...

259
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:11,469
Isn't that good enough?

260
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:14,467
That's good enough.

261
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:17,367
Thank you for your assistance.

262
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:19,412
We go our separate ways today.

263
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,184
What are you going to do to Nina?!

264
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,587
Are you going to kill her?

265
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:31,148
Be happy...

266
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:41,793
When are you going to
take me fishing?

267
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:43,468
Hm? Yeah...

268
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:46,636
Tomorrow, if the weather's good...

269
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:48,274
All right!

270
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:54,580
I no longer see ghosts...

271
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,020
That's a good look.

272
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:09,992
You look a lot like Johan.

273
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:11,894
When can I meet Johan?

274
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:15,958
I'm cooperating because you said
that you would let me meet Johan.

275
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:19,398
Indeed, he wants to
meet you as well...

276
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,572
Where is he right now?

277
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,434
He's living happily in Munich.

278
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:25,804
Munich?

279
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:28,578
That's a very good look.

280
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:30,481
It's truly a shame...

281
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,625
Now then... All that's left is...

282
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:47,428
Dr. Tenma, huh?

283
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,367
Why...Why did you come?

284
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:28,441
I told you.

285
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:31,440
I'm an ex-detective.

286
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:55,257
We're almost at your house.

287
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:57,270
Yeah...

288
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:03,905
Tomorrow...I promised Fritz
that I would go fishing with him.

289
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:06,905
I see...

290
00:22:08,248 --> 00:22:09,943
I hope the weather's good...

291
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:28,501
I'm sure it will be...
