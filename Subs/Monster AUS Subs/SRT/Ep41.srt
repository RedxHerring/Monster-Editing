1
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:09,363
Mr. Pedrov...

2
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:13,331
No, your real name
is Reinhart Biermann.

3
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:19,135
There was a special orphanage
in East Berlin, wasn't there?

4
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:22,540
It was an experiment lab where
scientific personality corrections

5
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,510
were performed on children.

6
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:30,046
511 Kinderheim.
You were the director there.

7
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:36,352
You should know everything,
since you were the director.

8
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:41,755
What were you trying to
achieve in East Berlin?

9
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:46,226
At 511 Kinderheim...

10
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:35,438
Wait!

11
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:37,934
Wait a moment, Mr. Pedrov.

12
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,946
You were a psychologist
and a psychiatrist.

13
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:45,896
When you were with
the Internal Affairs Ministry,

14
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,752
you specialized in scientific
personality programming.

15
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:49,788
In other words, brainwashing.

16
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:54,391
That doesn't sit right with me.

17
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,220
Why would
a brainwashing specialist

18
00:02:57,298 --> 00:03:00,290
be appointed director of
an ordinary orphanage?

19
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:03,270
If they wanted to raise children,

20
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:06,967
there were people who
were more suitable, right?

21
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:09,102
Leave.

22
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:11,672
I don't know what you're
talking about.

23
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:13,614
Leave.

24
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:19,650
Where did you hide the results of
the 511 Kinderheim experiments?

25
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,785
I've heard rumors.

26
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:26,452
When the Berlin Wall
was destroyed,

27
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:29,224
a countless number of
secret documents disappeared.

28
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:34,867
There's a theory that they were sent to
the Soviet Union via rail to Romania.

29
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:38,630
Unfortunately, there was a revolution
and the Ceaușescu government fell.

30
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:40,939
Supposedly,
the documents were lost.

31
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:46,781
But I don't think that the data
concerning 511 was lost.

32
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:49,108
Why?

33
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:52,783
Because you're a scholar.

34
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:04,097
A scholar's research reports and data
are more important to him than his life.

35
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:07,697
You wouldn't easily let go of
something that important, would you?

36
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:12,597
I'd like to see that data.

37
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,675
I know nothing.

38
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:19,213
What were you trying to do
at 511 Kinderheim?

39
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:20,540
I know nothing!

40
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,906
Was your experiment
a success?

41
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:36,455
Did you enjoy using humans
as your guinea pigs?

42
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:54,608
Your experiment failed,
didn't it?

43
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,756
In 1985, 511 Kinderheim
burned down.

44
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:07,752
According to rumors, the children of
the orphanage killed each other.

45
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:13,157
I was no longer
director at that time.

46
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:15,600
It doesn't involve me.

47
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,131
I see... You escaped death.

48
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,075
The director who succeeded you
was killed first in the riot.

49
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,681
That wouldn't have happened
if I had been there.

50
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,384
My experiment was a success.

51
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,187
Oh?

52
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:39,051
So are you saying that the experiment
was going well while you were director?

53
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,090
Ah...

54
00:05:42,363 --> 00:05:46,630
That means that even though
all the 511 Kinderheim data

55
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:49,534
was lost during the riot,

56
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:54,872
the experiment data from your time
as director still remains.

57
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,111
You're treading on
dangerous territory.

58
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,212
Who knows what'll
happen to you?

59
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:08,647
Was that a threat?
I'm not afraid.

60
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,682
Go away.

61
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:14,691
No. I'll follow you
until I get the truth.

62
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:16,230
Go away!

63
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:18,564
Don't come near me again!

64
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:19,859
Disappear!

65
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:24,166
Grandpa!

66
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,845
We came for you because you
were taking so long to come home.

67
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:34,206
Who is that man?

68
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:37,076
O-Oh, it's nothing.

69
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:38,979
Let's go home.

70
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:43,249
Leave this case alone.

71
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:56,099
A man who has committed
atrocities against children

72
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,800
is enjoying the remainder of his years
surrounded by his grandchildren.

73
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:17,150
Yes?

74
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,185
Who is it?

75
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:26,564
You have a package
from Mr. Pedrov.

76
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:30,769
Pedrov?
Hold on a second.

77
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:01,095
Corner rooms with bad views like
this one are convenient at times like this.

78
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:20,082
Well... I had a close call
this morning.

79
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:23,248
Strange men came to my hotel.

80
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:28,690
Are those your grandchildren?

81
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,322
A life free of worldly cares
is wonderful, isn't it?

82
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,628
Back in those days, when I was working
for a newspaper in East Germany,

83
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:40,766
I never would have dreamt that
I'd be living like I am now.

84
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:45,307
I'm a freelance journalist.
Free!

85
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:49,972
That was unimaginable
in a socialist country.

86
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:52,283
Freedom is good.

87
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:56,090
I've been following you.

88
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:04,030
I've been following you
since you left your house.

89
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:08,401
You have a nice house.
I bet it's got big rooms.

90
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,299
Rent is expensive, isn't it?

91
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,463
When it's cloudy,
you spend your time at cafés

92
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,066
and take walks with
your grandchildren.

93
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:18,436
You can maintain this
lifestyle without working.

94
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,779
Where are you
getting the money?

95
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,252
What did you sell? Did you sell
the data of your failed experiment?

96
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:31,621
For a high price?

97
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:34,183
It was a success.

98
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:37,356
All the more reason why
it would fetch a high price.

99
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:39,122
Leave me alone.

100
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:43,061
Leave me alone already.

101
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:04,691
My, my...

102
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,255
He's taking his grandchildren to movies
and eating chocolate parfaits at cafés.

103
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,238
Different children again.

104
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:24,807
One... Two...

105
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:27,136
Three... Four...

106
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:29,249
Five... Six...

107
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:46,092
It can't be...

108
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:39,950
Hi... This is Mr. Pedrov's house, isn't it?
May I come in?

109
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,087
Hi!

110
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:22,824
This is terrible.

111
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:32,064
He's doing it again.

112
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:39,080
He's trying to repeat
the same experiment.

113
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,989
This is terrible.

114
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:06,967
This is terrible.
He's trying to repeat the experiment.

115
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,003
There's a red light district
on the German border.

116
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:14,979
These children were born there.

117
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:19,195
Some on them were abandoned
because of the poverty

118
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:21,847
that stemmed from
the Berlin Wall falling.

119
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:27,052
You gathered these children

120
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:31,121
and are continuing
your 511 Kinderheim experiment.

121
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,166
Oh? Mr. Pedrov,
do you have a guest?

122
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:39,764
Yes. Don't mind him.
He's going home now.

123
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:43,768
Will knedlíky be fine
for tonight's dinner?

124
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:48,979
Yeah. Everyone loves
your knedlíky Mrs. Anna.

125
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,851
The continuation of
the 511 Kinderheim experiment, huh?

126
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,928
I tell you again,
that experiment was a success.

127
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:05,765
There's no need to continue it.

128
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,468
What do you mean
it was a success?

129
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,701
It means that the educational
program I created

130
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:17,040
produced wonderful
personalities.

131
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:19,179
Education?

132
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:22,142
What part of that
was education?!

133
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,648
That was human
experimentation!

134
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:29,386
Think hard.
What is education?

135
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:35,324
Isn't education supposed to create
people who are needed in society?

136
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:41,059
What kind of education is needed
to create such a person?

137
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:44,900
Education is an experiment.

138
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:49,307
511 Kinderheim...

139
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:54,806
An advanced educational system
was established there.

140
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:56,839
You did such horrible things.

141
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:58,745
How can you say that?

142
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,578
Horrible things?

143
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:03,284
Yeah! Think about what
you did to those children!

144
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,619
Think about what horrible
things you've done!

145
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:06,587
You're just a freelancer.

146
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:10,791
Don't act as if you know anything
with your surface data!

147
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:15,827
What's with that look?

148
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:23,832
The incident that happened
at that orphanage...

149
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:28,246
Are you saying that your experiment
led the children to kill each other?

150
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:34,352
I told you! That happened after I was
removed from my position as director.

151
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:40,551
The program went awry when
an unexpected factor arose.

152
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:43,960
Unexpected factor?

153
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:49,169
Darkness.

154
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:55,140
Hate... Nihilism...
Destructive urges...

155
00:15:56,176 --> 00:15:59,202
Those are factors that
people easily succumb to.

156
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:07,980
They possessed 511 Kinderheim
when a certain boy appeared.

157
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,382
Are you saying that
that's also not your doing?

158
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:17,758
As I'll keep on telling you...
the experiment was a success.

159
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:24,070
That's a lie. Those from 511 Kinderheim
are all missing something in common.

160
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:28,366
They can't love.

161
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,674
That's a very interesting observation.

162
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:37,212
Now, this is the end of our chat.
I ask you to leave.

163
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:39,885
Don't bother me anymore.

164
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:43,379
No. The Czech Republic
is a democratic country now.

165
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:45,556
I'm going to report this
to the police.

166
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:50,521
You don't have the right to run
an orphanage in this country.

167
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:52,664
This place is unauthorized.

168
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:56,528
If I report you,
you'll be arrested.

169
00:16:57,704 --> 00:16:58,728
Are you trying to make a deal?

170
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:08,373
Are you offering to not report me in return
for handing over my experiment data?

171
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,679
Everyone...let's go!

172
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,120
What are you going to do?

173
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:21,760
That's it! Let's play soccer.

174
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:23,960
Soccer!
- I wanna play soccer.

175
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:26,165
All right, let's go!

176
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,201
Let's go! Let's go!
- What are you thinking?!

177
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:32,995
As you heard...
we're going to play soccer.

178
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,348
Say, everyone!

179
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:56,386
Mr. Pedrov made me a deal.

180
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:01,627
But for your sake,
that deal doesn't matter.

181
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:07,035
If I report him to the police,
you'll be free.

182
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:09,841
You all want to leave that house,
don't you?

183
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:14,948
No!
- No!

184
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:21,044
You'll be freer outside!

185
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:22,449
Listen to me.

186
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:30,388
Old Man, that ball's coming to you!

187
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,764
You suck!

188
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:42,268
Ow...

189
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,639
They're...laughing...

190
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:59,315
How can they laugh with
such genuine happiness?

191
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:04,857
It can't be...

192
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:08,595
Oh, Sir!

193
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:18,804
Wait, Sir!

194
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,594
What a beautiful woman.

195
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:39,725
Yeah.

196
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:43,865
Mr. Pedrov,
could it be that you...

197
00:19:54,147 --> 00:19:54,773
What the–?

198
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:57,409
Mr. Pedrov!

199
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,351
Mrs. Anna!
- What's wrong, Mrs. Anna!

200
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,193
Mr. Pedrov!

201
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:09,729
Get a hold of yourself!

202
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:13,658
G-Grandpa?

203
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:15,401
Grandpa.

204
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:18,694
Who shot you, Mr. Pedrov!
- Grandpa, what's wrong?

205
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,206
Grandpa.

206
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,198
That woman.

207
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:23,910
Woman?

208
00:20:24,277 --> 00:20:25,767
Grandpa!

209
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:27,714
Grandpa!

210
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:29,940
What's wrong, Grandpa?!

211
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:32,542
You're bleeding, Grandpa!

212
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,023
Mr. Pedrov,
could it be that you...

213
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:39,885
The key...

214
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:40,719
Huh?

215
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:46,496
The key...the card...
the pin number...

216
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:51,736
They're behind
my third drawer.

217
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:57,437
I have my experiment data
and the tape in a safe box.

218
00:20:58,545 --> 00:20:59,171
Tape?

219
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,080
A tape of an interview...
with a certain boy.

220
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:11,984
He retells his past through
the use of hypnosis and drugs.

221
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:19,456
He's the monster that led
511 Kinderheim to destruction.

222
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:23,269
Grandpa!

223
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:25,530
Don't die, Grandpa!

224
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:29,437
What do you think
of these children?

225
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:33,440
Are they lacking anything?

226
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:39,847
Mr. Pedrov, you educated
these children in a different way

227
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,252
from those in 511 Kinderheim.

228
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:47,319
Hate... Nihilism...
Destructive urges...

229
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:52,298
I wanted to make a person who
wouldn't succumb to darkness.

230
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:55,693
How do you think that's done?

231
00:21:57,704 --> 00:21:58,671
Love...

232
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:04,639
Honestly...
That's a new discovery.

233
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:12,282
Mr. Pedrov...it's pretty natural for
parents to give that to their children.

234
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,453
No. It's an experiment.

235
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:23,661
Grandpa!
- Grandpa!
