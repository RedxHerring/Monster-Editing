1
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:13,164
Please tell me! Who are you?
And I'm not Anna!

2
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:14,602
I'm Nina!

3
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:19,401
No, when you were brought into
my hospital, your name was Anna.

4
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:24,306
And your brother's name was Johan.

5
00:00:25,413 --> 00:00:26,380
My brother...

6
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:37,992
Johan...

7
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,294
Anna...

8
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:45,799
Johan...

9
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:27,593
Mr. Fortner!!

10
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:31,196
Mr. Maurer!!

11
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:37,175
Mr. Maurer! Mr. Maurer!

12
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:39,306
Mr. Fortner! It's Tenma!

13
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:42,913
Anna...I mean,
I've brought Nina home safely!

14
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:45,219
Mr. Maurer...!

15
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:51,025
<i>I'll call the police from here.</i>

16
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:02,861
<i>It doesn't look like
the police ever came...</i>

17
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:05,439
<i>It can't be...</i>

18
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:21,782
Live...

19
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,885
Please... Come back to life...

20
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:28,780
You must come back to life!!

21
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:41,401
Please...

22
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:43,871
I'm begging you...

23
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,107
Please...

24
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:07,350
Mr. Maurer...
Your favorite cigarettes...

25
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:15,936
Mr. Maurer!!

26
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,777
That day...

27
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:26,880
I killed him...

28
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,388
I...killed...him...

29
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:40,795
Kill me...

30
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:51,902
I killed him... I killed him...

31
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:56,305
Nina.
- But that day, I killed my brother!!

32
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:17,226
I... I brought him back to life...

33
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,240
The phone line has been cut...

34
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:31,078
We've got to get
away from here quickly.

35
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:35,041
He'll come to take you away.

36
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:50,264
Is everything all right?

37
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:51,598
Huh?!

38
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,098
We're the police.
We received a call.

39
00:06:56,604 --> 00:07:00,006
If you don't mind,
we'll have a look around inside.

40
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,858
What in the world...?

41
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:09,008
This is terrible.

42
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:13,313
Are you two all right? Any injuries?

43
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,957
Thank heavens.
We'll have help soon.

44
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,726
They'll take care of the scene.

45
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:24,656
We'll hear your stories
down at headquarters.

46
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,730
Is she the victims' daughter?

47
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:33,840
Poor thing...

48
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:47,647
I see... So that means
you didn't see who did it?

49
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:52,286
To think something like that could
happen in such a peaceful town...

50
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:55,991
Where are you from? China?

51
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:59,062
No. I'm Japanese.
My name is Tenma.

52
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,427
Oh, you're Japanese...

53
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,401
What a terrible experience for you
in such a faraway land...

54
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:11,609
Steady... You're all right now...

55
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:24,916
Uh... Where are we headed?

56
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,952
The Police Department.

57
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:31,254
But the Heidelberg Police Department
is in the middle of town.

58
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,426
We're from Mannheim Precinct
in the next town.

59
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:41,134
<i>I wonder why they're taking us
to the next precinct...</i>

60
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,077
We'll be there in about 15 minutes.

61
00:08:45,513 --> 00:08:46,878
Uh...I see...

62
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:57,185
<i>He said they got a call...
They came because they got a call...</i>

63
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:00,417
<i>Who could have called them?</i>

64
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:03,223
<i>The phone line was dead...</i>

65
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,328
<i>This car came without sirens blaring...</i>

66
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:11,337
<i>Would the police whisk away
the people who discovered the bodies</i>

67
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,134
<i>without first securing the scene?</i>

68
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:18,405
<i>Still, those police IDs
looked authentic...</i>

69
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:25,852
<i>Blood!</i>

70
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:27,854
<i>No way..</i>

71
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:35,661
<i>It couldn't be that these men...</i>

72
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:46,874
U-Um...

73
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:58,581
A-A roadblock...?

74
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:04,891
<i>Thank goodness...</i>

75
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,206
We're searching for
a hit-and-run driver,

76
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,197
so we'd appreciate your help.

77
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:11,659
U-Um...

78
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:12,699
Huh?!

79
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:16,298
Well, if it isn't Detective Mesner
and Detective Muller.

80
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:17,968
Yes... See you're doing your job...

81
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:20,464
Are you on your way
back to headquarters?

82
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,110
Wow, you've got a new car.

83
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:24,505
<i>- What's going on...?</i>
- How nice...!

84
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:27,010
It'll be a junk heap in no time.

85
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:29,409
That's 'cause you don't take care of it.

86
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,717
Uh, excuse me!

87
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:32,919
Uh...

88
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,513
This girl says she doesn't feel well.
Can we go out and get some air?

89
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:38,191
Oh...

90
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:39,727
Oh, go ahead.

91
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,192
Did those two do something?

92
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:51,032
No, nothing like that.

93
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:56,701
<i>What's going on?
Are they really detectives?</i>

94
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:02,377
<i>But what about that blood...?
Whose call did they receive...?</i>

95
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,045
<i>They didn't even turn on their siren...</i>

96
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,089
<i>What should we do? What...?</i>

97
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:13,792
<i>Is everything all right, Dr. Tenma?</i>

98
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,397
How...?

99
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:22,796
How did you know?

100
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,200
I gave you my name,
but I didn't tell you that I was a doctor!

101
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:30,201
How did you know that?!

102
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:25,188
There was a grocery story nearby.
I even found some clothes.

103
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:29,392
There's bread, sausage and cheese.

104
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:32,899
I even had them pour
some coffee into this thermos...

105
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:38,476
You may not have any appetite,
but you've got to eat.

106
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:53,427
Anyway, you'd better change
your clothes. You're freezing.

107
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:14,247
There were lots of dead people...

108
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:20,747
My brother and I walked among them,
just the two of us.

109
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:27,188
It was like...we were the only people
left in the world.

110
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:31,391
Where was that?
Can't you remember?

111
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:37,694
We crossed the border...
A man and and his wife cheered us up.

112
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:40,464
They were so kind to us...

113
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:46,201
Then my brother said that
he had a good plan.

114
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:50,017
Not long after that...

115
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:53,377
The man and his wife died...

116
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:58,982
I don't know why,

117
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:02,654
but everyone who's ever
been nice to us...all die...

118
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:09,662
But one day, I discovered
the reason why... That rainy day...

119
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:15,332
You're talking about
Mr. and Mrs. Liebert, aren't you?

120
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,280
My brother shot them...
My brother killed them...

121
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,086
He's killed them all up till now...

122
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:40,494
That's why I took the gun...
I aimed it at my brother...

123
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:43,704
That's when he said...

124
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:46,670
He laughed as he said,

125
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:51,774
After you shoot me,
throw the gun outside...

126
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:54,610
Be sure you shoot me in the head."

127
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:04,347
I shot him like he said...
I aimed for his head...

128
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,851
Why did you save him...?

129
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:17,881
If you hadn't saved him,

130
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:20,533
my mom and dad
wouldn't have been killed.

131
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:24,967
Why did you save him...?

132
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:36,454
Don't move from this place.
I'll go to the police...

133
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:41,683
But if the detectives last night
were the real thing, that means that

134
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:45,095
someone in the police department
is on Johan's side...

135
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,394
But we can't just stay here like this...

136
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:51,571
Now, listen, Nina...

137
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:54,297
Johan is trying to take you away.

138
00:15:55,108 --> 00:15:56,667
I want you to hide
if someone comes looking.

139
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:03,507
You have to eat,
drink some hot coffee,

140
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:08,420
then sleep for a while...
That's how people go on living.

141
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:13,957
You're alive...
You must think about the future.

142
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:17,063
Your future...

143
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:21,427
Don't you have any leads?

144
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:23,566
Is there any connection to the string

145
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,661
of killings of middle-age couples
throughout Germany?

146
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:29,665
As I said, we are putting all of
our resources into this case,

147
00:16:29,776 --> 00:16:31,972
but I am not free to
disclose any details.

148
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:36,146
We have found that
Mr. and Mrs. Fortner have a daughter.

149
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:37,980
Where is she?

150
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:40,084
That is under investigation as well.

151
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,651
Why was that newspaper reporter,
Maurer, with them?

152
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:47,387
Who was that Japanese guy
who is said to have been with him?

153
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:50,688
Japanese? He sounds suspicious!

154
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:54,110
Was that murder at Heidelberg Castle,

155
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:57,399
that occurred at nearly the same time,
the work of the same killer?!

156
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:00,301
<i>Heidelberg Castle...?!</i>

157
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:04,341
So he was killed, as well...?

158
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:06,444
Just a minute...

159
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,043
Anyway, we will keep you
abreast of the happenings!

160
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:12,951
Excuse me... Please let me through.

161
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:15,913
There's not enough for an article!!

162
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:18,124
U-Um...

163
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:24,374
Oh! I appreciate the help offered
by the Mannheim police,

164
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:26,366
Detectives Mesner and Muller.

165
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:32,264
Just give us our orders.
We'll do all we can to help.

166
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,573
How are the investigations
coming along?

167
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,277
We can talk about it inside...

168
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:48,846
<i>They're real...</i>

169
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:52,356
<i>Those guys are really
with the police...</i>

170
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:54,488
<i>What should I do...?!</i>

171
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,327
The Heidelberg Post...!

172
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:05,004
What? I can't hear you!
The editing room is in chaos...!

173
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:07,150
Huh?
- At any rate,

174
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:08,952
Who are you...?
- we have to find that Japanese guy

175
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:10,637
who was with Maurer!
He knows something!

176
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:14,044
Please quiet down! I'm on the phone!

177
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:15,815
Hello?!

178
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:18,817
I will bring an important witness
to your office at 5:00.

179
00:18:19,286 --> 00:18:21,448
You must not let the police know.

180
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:23,623
Is that true?!
This isn't a hoax, is it?!

181
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,657
Hello...!

182
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:29,672
<i>If I can't trust the police,
there's only the paper...</i>

183
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:32,757
<i>that can. ..keep Nina safe...</i>

184
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:43,276
Mr. Maurer...

185
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:47,672
You shouldn't be in here
without permission.

186
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:50,980
Besides, you're here from
the federal police to investigate

187
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,348
the killings of the middle-age couples,
aren't you?

188
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:57,655
We only have files on
the killing at the castle here...

189
00:18:57,724 --> 00:18:58,691
Inspector Lunge.

190
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:04,288
Sorry... Something was bothering me.

191
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:08,695
The case you're looking at and
this one happened at the same time.

192
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:10,937
It couldn't be the same perpetrator.

193
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:12,238
I see.

194
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:16,499
This guy... It looks like there are signs
that his hands had been tied.

195
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:19,606
Did you find rope or anything nearby?

196
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:24,644
No... It had been removed
by the time the victim was found.

197
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:27,547
I...see...

198
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:43,133
<i>There are four possible routes
of escape from the scene...</i>

199
00:19:43,804 --> 00:19:46,830
<i>He had to consider whether
he'd be hidden from sight,</i>

200
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:50,367
<i>how crowded the area was
where he'd come out,</i>

201
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:52,642
<i>and the locations of the lights.</i>

202
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:15,359
Found it...

203
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:22,074
Nina, it's me... It's Tenma.

204
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,977
Nina! You needn't hide anymore.

205
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:28,481
Nina!

206
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:33,186
Don't tell me...

207
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:38,016
Nina...! Nina...!

208
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,723
Where are you? Nina...!! Nina...!!

209
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,041
Nina... Was she taken away...?

210
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:58,333
I shouldn't have left her alone.

211
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:25,202
<i>Dr. Tenma, it wasn't your fault.</i>

212
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:29,404
<i>You just did what you
had to do as a doctor...</i>

213
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:31,711
<i>It wasn't your fault.</i>

214
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:38,778
<i>Please eat the sandwiches
and get some rest.</i>

215
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,523
<i>I want you to survive,
and save as many people as you can.</i>

216
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:48,926
<i>Nina Fortner.</i>

217
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:09,642
<i>Nina... What do you intend to do...?</i>

218
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:14,980
<i>Do you intend to try to
kill him again...?!</i>

219
00:22:17,123 --> 00:22:23,790
<i>I brought him back to life...
That monster... I...</i>

220
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,491
<i>I brought him back to life...</i>
