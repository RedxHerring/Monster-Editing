1
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:16,536
My consciousness awakened inside
a coin locker in complete darkness.

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,235
Blue...

3
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:23,168
The blue sky...

4
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:26,910
The blue sea...

5
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,250
And the blue window frame...

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,222
I want to go to Tunisia.

7
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:44,292
Gunter Milch.

8
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:49,736
Arrested in '88 for robbing a Bavaria
BASF Bank cash transport vehicle.

9
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:52,664
He was placed in
Badenburg Prison.

10
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:55,643
In '91 he escaped
from that prison.

11
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:58,211
In half a year, he managed to
cut through the iron bars of his cell

12
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:00,270
with a nail that he had
fashioned into a rasp.

13
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:02,607
Three days later...
He was caught.

14
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:04,882
He was imprisoned again
in Kreiner Prison.

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,188
But in '93 he escaped through
the sewage drain pipe.

16
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,551
His prison clothes were found next to
a nearby river, covered in raw sewage.

17
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:17,195
He was arrested while trying to rob a
Maximillian and Co. salary delivery truck.

18
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:21,293
In '97, in Ingebork
Prison's showers...

19
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:25,069
He spent a year making a hole
with a spoon and escaped.

20
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,474
The smell of the toilets
here is really terrible.

21
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:33,613
I crawled through sewage pipes,
so I'm sure of it.

22
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:35,012
Be quiet and walk!

23
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,023
What a miserable face.

24
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:48,151
Face forward!

25
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,788
I believe he was called Dr. Tenma,
or something.

26
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,127
Get walking!

27
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:57,228
I never would've thought he'd be
such a miserable looking guy

28
00:01:57,305 --> 00:01:59,171
with a face like that,
devoid of any hopes or dreams.

29
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:29,795
I'll ask you once more.

30
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:33,163
Do you deny any involvement
in the poisoning of

31
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:36,795
Eisler Memorial Hospital's
Director Heinemann,

32
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:41,707
Chief of Surgery Oppenheim,
and Dr. Boyer eight years ago?

33
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:49,879
So you plan on keeping quiet
throughout the interrogation...

34
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:52,784
Cut it out!

35
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:57,314
Dr. Tenma.. .
what do you plan to do?

36
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,560
You'll still be sent to trial
even if you stay silent.

37
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:02,922
You have no chance in court.

38
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:07,491
Talk! Why don't you tell us
everything and get it off your chest?

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,535
What's wrong?
What's the fuss?!

40
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:18,171
Milch is suffering from
stomach pains!

41
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:22,742
Doctor!

42
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:24,074
Dr. Duller!

43
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,482
Where's Dr. Duller?!

44
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:31,892
The doctor is in the examination room.
Peter swallowed the janitors' detergent!

45
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:37,724
Do you think he's
choking on vomit?

46
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,425
What?!

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,895
I can't breathe.

48
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,562
Damn it. Let's call him.

49
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:46,399
Huh?!

50
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,300
The doctor.

51
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,211
Can you take a look?

52
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:05,259
Does it hurt here?

53
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:08,221
How about here?

54
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:11,064
Get some hot water!

55
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:12,662
And some towels
and a change of clothes!

56
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:14,391
Get out of the room!

57
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:15,994
This could be contagious!

58
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:25,643
Why are you
pretending to be sick?

59
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:34,948
Be nice.

60
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,720
You're the first doctor who
saw through my act this quickly.

61
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:46,761
I figured that I would have more chances
to escape if I were sent to a hospital.

62
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:50,336
Do you know how I rob
cash transport trucks?

63
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:54,142
I act like I'm sick and
jump in front of the truck.

64
00:05:55,142 --> 00:06:00,478
When the guards came out panicking,
my friend comes out with a gun.

65
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,440
I never killed anyone.

66
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:05,749
Unlike you.

67
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,421
How about it?
Want to escape with me?

68
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:16,058
You have such
a miserable face.

69
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:19,866
You start to look like that
when you're in here.

70
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:23,764
I hate cramped spaces like this.

71
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:32,813
My consciousness awakened inside
a coin locker in complete darkness.

72
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,752
My father and mother left me in there
while they went to work.

73
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,447
I kept waiting to go home.

74
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:48,386
"Let's go to Tunisia some day"'
my father and mother always said.

75
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:54,930
My father said, "If work goes
well today, we're going to Tunisia!"

76
00:06:57,905 --> 00:07:01,569
But I waited for three days
and they never came back.

77
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:09,447
My father and mother left me
and probably went to Tunisia.

78
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:11,976
I'm also going.

79
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,519
I'm going to get out of
this cramped place and go to Tunisia.

80
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:21,722
What a miserable face.

81
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:26,530
Your face has no hope.

82
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:28,993
You don't have hope like I do.

83
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:33,802
What will you do
if you're caught again?

84
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,032
I'm going to run away again.

85
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:40,246
I'll do it over and over again.

86
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:44,542
Now then...

87
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,451
Are you going to
stay quiet today, too?

88
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:50,590
The truth.

89
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,193
As we do this,
something terrible will happen.

90
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:57,456
The truth.

91
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:00,364
You won't believe me.

92
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:03,062
You won't believe what I say.

93
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:06,432
But I must fight!

94
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,673
Over...and over.

95
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:14,204
I must tell the truth!

96
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:20,647
Therefore, I sentence the accused
to 20 years of imprisonment.

97
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:26,625
The day my father was found guilty,
my way of life was decided

98
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:29,119
After the war,

99
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,530
my father moved from Sudetenland
in Czechoslovakia to Germany.

100
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,662
He started a small
radio station in '49.

101
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:40,370
But in the 60s, during the Cold War,
my father was arrested for spying

102
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:43,843
and for the murder of
a federal politician's secretary.

103
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:47,104
The news caused shockwaves
in West German society.

104
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:49,850
My father stood
by his innocence.

105
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:52,547
But he was sentenced to
20 years of imprisonment.

106
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:58,286
My mother continued to fight for my
father's innocence, and, in '71 , she died.

107
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:03,461
In '72, my father also
regrettably died in jail.

108
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:10,637
In '73, when I was in the gymnasium,
my father's innocence was proven.

109
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:14,266
After I graduated
from Düsseldorf University,

110
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:18,005
I was I was invited to join
the famous Hoffmann Law Office.

111
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:20,538
In the first case I was assigned,

112
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:23,481
I proved the innocence of
the falsely accused defendant.

113
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:27,085
After that, I've continued to disprove false
allegations in the cases I was in charge of.

114
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:33,984
I, Fritz Verdemann, went from being the
son of a spy to a hero in the legal world.

115
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,867
<i>Over the Rainbow...</i>

116
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:47,199
The radio station
that my father ran

117
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:50,471
would always begin and
end everyday with that song.

118
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:52,136
Oh?

119
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:57,683
To you and my father who were in the East,
it probably symbolized the free world.

120
00:09:58,319 --> 00:09:58,979
Yes.

121
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:03,387
My father died in jail fighting
for his innocence.

122
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:08,250
To clear away that regret, I want to be
involved in as many cases as possible

123
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,229
where the person standing trial
may be falsely accused.

124
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:16,662
Tell me more
about Dr. Tenma.

125
00:10:25,813 --> 00:10:28,680
Ilsa, how was
your prenatal check-up?

126
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,174
I'm doing well.

127
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:33,187
The doctor said that the baby
could be born any time soon.

128
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:36,256
You passed by a man in the lobby,
didn't you?

129
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,786
Yes. Is he the man who
you were talking about?

130
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:39,886
Yes.

131
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:42,618
Alfred Baul...

132
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:46,489
He asked me if I wanted to
represent Dr. Tenma with him.

133
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:50,861
Didn't you turn down
Dr. Tenma's case the other day?

134
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:55,969
Yes. But that time,
the client was Hans Georg Schuwald.

135
00:10:56,677 --> 00:11:02,377
I wasn't sure why that tycoon would
want me to be Dr. Tenma's lawyer.

136
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:05,948
But, this time,
a different reason became clear.

137
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,949
What reason?

138
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:15,522
The clients that Mr. Baul talked about were
patients whose lives Dr. Tenma had saved.

139
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:16,789
Oh.

140
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:23,627
This Dr. Tenma was definitely
a wonderful doctor.

141
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:25,934
Why don't you
take up the case?

142
00:11:26,874 --> 00:11:32,210
If I win the case, I can receive
a large reward from the tycoon,

143
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,475
but not so from the patients.

144
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:40,584
If you did your job for the money,
you'd have a larger office right now.

145
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:51,894
Oh. It's <i>Over the Rainbow...</i>

146
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:58,064
Turn it off.

147
00:11:58,606 --> 00:11:59,232
Huh?!

148
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:03,843
Please turn it off.

149
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:05,070
O-Okay.

150
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:12,542
Anyway, let's go get
something to eat.

151
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,957
You've got to eat for yourself and
the new life that's going to be born.

152
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:21,653
Our baby's moving around
because it's hungry.

153
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:26,328
Well Missus...
What restaurant shall we go to?

154
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,567
Well...

155
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:29,034
What about that place?

156
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:36,573
Then he disappeared
into the flames.

157
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,844
That was the last time
I saw Johan.

158
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:47,847
Shall I tell my story from
the beginning once more?

159
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,054
I will keep telling it.

160
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,558
I will keep telling the truth.

161
00:12:54,962 --> 00:13:00,025
You're the fourth lawyer
who's come to see me.

162
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:05,496
But they all want me admit to part of
the crime and try to lighten my sentence.

163
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,166
That's all they talk about.

164
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:09,265
Probably.

165
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,913
You seem like you don't want
to prove your innocence,

166
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:18,543
but rather prove the existence
of the young man called Johan.

167
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:19,878
That's right.

168
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,955
Then you don't
really need a lawyer.

169
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:28,651
Dr. Tenma...

170
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,428
When did this really begin?

171
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:35,201
As I said, a boy with a gunshot
wound to his head was carried in.

172
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:39,102
No, didn't something
happen before that?

173
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,341
A Turkish woman...

174
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:50,378
<i>Bring back my husband!</i>

175
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:53,487
<i>After all, people's live
aren't created equal.</i>

176
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:57,049
People's lives are equal.

177
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:05,394
I don't know...
if what I did was the right thing.

178
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:09,163
I don't know if my patients
are good or evil.

179
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:11,204
My sin is...

180
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,639
My sin is saving that boy's life.

181
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:17,903
But...

182
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:19,839
But...

183
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:23,277
Does a doctor have the right
to choose who to save

184
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,341
based on whether
his patient is good or evil?!

185
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:28,555
<i>People's lives
aren't created equal.</i>

186
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,457
They're equal.

187
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:32,492
I don't know.

188
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,819
Even now, I can't tell.

189
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:38,589
It's the same with lawyers.

190
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:43,331
You can't tell if the accused
is good or evil.

191
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:50,002
I have a list of names here of the
people who asked me to represent you.

192
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:57,676
Mr. Michail Hotter, Mr. Stephan Crump,
Mr. Franz Kieffer, Mr. Rudolf Huber...

193
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:02,049
Mr. Kieffer... Mr. Huber.. .
They are doing well, huh?

194
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,459
Mr. Horst Henschel,
Mr. Harmut Hess...

195
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:07,885
Even Mr. Hess. .. I see.

196
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:11,025
I wonder if he's living happily
with his grandchild.

197
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:13,793
Time's up.

198
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:16,499
I see. Thank goodness.

199
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:22,275
Dr. Tenma...

200
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:25,545
I'll take up your case.

201
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,385
Even lawyers can't tell
if people are good or evil.

202
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,883
The only thing I can do when
I defend someone is to believe.

203
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:44,164
One more.

204
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,156
I said, "One more !"

205
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:48,702
Well Ma'am...

206
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:52,801
When did this place
start refusing my orders?!

207
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:02,942
Hey!

208
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:06,079
You just laughed,
didn't you?!

209
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,783
N-No.

210
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:11,348
You laughed!
You looked at me and laughed!

211
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,860
I remember you!

212
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:20,162
You used to come to my house often
and bow your head,

213
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:23,295
Mr. North Rhine West Bank
assistant branch manager!

214
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:27,967
What a look!
I've finally came back...

215
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:33,244
Eva Heinemann has
come back to Düsseldorf!

216
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:40,281
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me, Dr. Reichwein.

217
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:43,156
I've been calling you
ever since I heard that

218
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:45,590
Dr. Tenma had obtained
legal representation.

219
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:50,421
I'm sorry I'm usually not home. I've
been running around investigating.

220
00:16:50,964 --> 00:16:51,590
Investigating?

221
00:16:52,065 --> 00:16:56,866
Yes. I've been visiting Dr. Tenma's
former patients who are supporting him.

222
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,632
What did they say?

223
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,166
It seems that Dr. Tenma
is a wonderful doctor.

224
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:05,540
So did you get any
important testimonies?

225
00:17:06,113 --> 00:17:11,074
No. I'd like if I could connect a
testimony to Dr. Tenma's alibi, but...

226
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:15,856
Anyway, in order to prove
Tenma's innocence,

227
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:18,517
we need to prove
Johan's existence.

228
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:20,585
Dr. Reichwein...

229
00:17:21,028 --> 00:17:21,654
Huh?

230
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:25,860
Dr. Tenma said that he was going to
shoot the young man named Johan.

231
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,558
I'd like to cover up
that testimony.

232
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:30,365
Huh? W-Well...

233
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:34,435
That event is the only one
that can prove Johan exists.

234
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:37,838
Tenma is innocent no matter
if Johan exists or not.

235
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:46,481
Listen, Dr. Reichwein.
This country only wants a scapegoat.

236
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:53,026
My child will be born soon.
I want true justice for my child as well!

237
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:58,262
There are judges and lawyers who will
place the guilt on an innocent person

238
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,666
just so that they can wrap up
their cases quickly!

239
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,935
This entire country must repent
for its lack of justice.

240
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,039
That's what's important!

241
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:09,904
Dr. Reichwein...

242
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:11,837
Y-Yeah.

243
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,171
I'm searching for
someone right now.

244
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,346
She might know
something important.

245
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:22,548
She?

246
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:26,916
Dr. Tenma's former fiancée...
Eva Heinemann.

247
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:31,497
What's wrong,
Dr. Reichwein?

248
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:33,325
She's here.

249
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:34,360
Huh?

250
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:38,799
That woman came with me
to this town.

251
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:46,137
Everyone is always laughing.

252
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:49,643
Laughing at me...

253
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:53,248
Eva, listen to me.

254
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,652
I'm listening.
How annoying!

255
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,221
I want you to meet
Tenma's lawyer.

256
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,187
For Tenma...

257
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:01,687
Huh?

258
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:09,158
Didn't I tell you the other day?
I tried to shoot him.

259
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:13,073
I was surprised when
you told me that.

260
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:15,800
But you didn't shoot him!

261
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:18,805
Yes. I didn't shoot him.

262
00:19:19,446 --> 00:19:20,743
Do you know why?

263
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:23,443
It's problematic for me
if he dies.

264
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:30,951
I won't let the man who ruined my life
die that easily!

265
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:36,520
He's got to be put in jail for the rest
of his life and regret what he did!

266
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,524
Regret for the rest of his life
that he dumped me!

267
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:57,780
She fell asleep.

268
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,237
What's wrong?
Were you dreaming?

269
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:28,071
Three gunshots.
I didn't see him.

270
00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:35,344
I.. .didn't see the blond haired man.

271
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:39,551
Eva...

272
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:43,763
Did you see Johan?

273
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,898
<i>Over the Rainbow...</i>

274
00:20:49,736 --> 00:20:52,137
A song that symbolizes
the free world.

275
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:58,010
Mr. Verdemann, your wife
has gone into labor.

276
00:20:58,078 --> 00:20:59,045
She's been taken to the hospital.

277
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:00,140
What?

278
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:00,971
I see!

279
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:02,682
Klinger...

280
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:04,678
Contact Mr. Baul immediately!

281
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:05,478
Okay!

282
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,648
I was going to
see Dr. Tenma right now,

283
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,246
but ask him if he can
see Dr. Tenma instead!

284
00:21:10,624 --> 00:21:13,355
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Baul.

285
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:18,525
I came to see you today.
How are you?

286
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:20,390
Are you getting enough sleep?

287
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:21,693
Yes.

288
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:22,795
That's good.

289
00:21:23,737 --> 00:21:24,363
Whoops.

290
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:29,174
I'm actually right handed.

291
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:33,670
I just can't get used to holding
a pen with my left hand.

292
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:36,505
My right hand doesn't move.

293
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,956
Do you remember me?
I've lost some weight.

294
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:53,433
Well, I'm even impressed with myself
that I escaped that sea of fire.

295
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:57,093
You really shot me.

296
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,587
This left hand...

297
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:18,991
It's still hard using pens, but it's gotten
quite used to handling a gun.

298
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,460
To tell you the truth, I was thinking of killing your former fiancée... Eva Heinemann.
