1
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:27,515
Hi, Anna.

2
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:29,840
The wind's gotten cold,
hasn't it?

3
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,050
What's wrong with her?
She's pretty unsociable today.

4
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:40,687
Oh?

5
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,857
Are you going
home now, Anna?

6
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:12,519
Nina!

7
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:20,800
The restaurants in this area
are already closed.

8
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:23,094
Let's go back to the hotel, Nina.

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,503
What's wrong, Nina?

10
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:33,473
For some reason,
the people on this street know me.

11
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:39,045
They call me "Anna."

12
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,087
Oh?

13
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:22,047
What's the meaning of this?

14
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:27,161
Suk is a suspect in
a multiple homicide case,

15
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:29,060
but I don't see any
police or police cars.

16
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,457
Yeah.

17
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:32,996
Anyway, I'm going to
check on the situation.

18
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:37,501
Well... Whatever the case,
I've got to go.

19
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:45,709
It's the same inside.
There's no sign of the police.

20
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:52,547
Excuse me. There's an injured man
named Suk being hospitalized here.

21
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,646
Huh?

22
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,688
Jan Suk... He's a detective.

23
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,016
Detective?

24
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,158
There were a lot of injured men at
the abandoned building on Bruno Street.

25
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:04,295
Oh. One of those unemployed men
who were injured in the fight?

26
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,267
Unemployed? Fight?

27
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:08,228
Yes.

28
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:11,467
I don't know what they
were saying on the news,

29
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,200
but that's probably the story.

30
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,567
And? What room are
they in right now?

31
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:18,436
They had terrible wounds,

32
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:20,743
but after we treated them, they were
all moved to a different hospital.

33
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:22,540
Moved to a different hospital?

34
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,276
Which one?!

35
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:27,751
Who knows? An ambulance came
and loaded up all six of them.

36
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:31,516
There were six men
who attacked us.

37
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:34,295
What about Suk?
Where's Detective Jan Suk?

38
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:35,823
He was shot.

39
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:40,726
There weren't any patients brought in
with gunshot wounds.

40
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:45,132
Then is there any record of a patient
brought in with the name Jan Suk?

41
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:47,967
None at all.

42
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:56,212
Research data concerning
511 Kinderheim and a tape?

43
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:57,243
Yeah.

44
00:04:57,518 --> 00:05:00,564
A former director of 511 Kinderheim,
named Pedrov,

45
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:02,181
gave it to me before he died.

46
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,351
He was running an illegal orphanage
in Prague.

47
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:08,460
Who would be after it?

48
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,989
I don't really know.

49
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:17,300
But I'm sure that the former
Czechoslovakian secret police are after it.

50
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:20,373
Where are the data
and the tape right now?

51
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:24,037
I don't have it with me.
I'm keeping it in a certain location.

52
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:25,702
Because of that,

53
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,978
Detective Suk was seriously injured
and was kidnapped from the hospital.

54
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:35,788
We don't know what they'll do to Suk
to get what they want.

55
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,655
How depressing.

56
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:44,592
The data and the contents
of the tape.. . What are they?

57
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:49,030
The research data was
a list of technical terms.

58
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:50,366
There was also a list of names.

59
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:52,500
I didn't examine it closely.

60
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,099
I only listened to
the main parts of the tape.

61
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:57,738
What was it a recording of?

62
00:05:58,512 --> 00:05:59,479
A child's voice.

63
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,474
A child?

64
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:04,941
He was probably drugged,
then questioned.

65
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:08,678
When asked what his name was,
he answered, "Johan."

66
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:13,619
What's wrong, Doctor Tenma?

67
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:15,757
511 Kinderheim...

68
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:18,022
Research data...

69
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:19,993
Johan...

70
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:22,995
Where's the tape right now?!

71
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:31,004
Can you come with me?

72
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,037
Where is Suk?

73
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:35,776
Let's do this in
a business-like manner.

74
00:06:36,117 --> 00:06:37,084
Where's Suk?

75
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:39,749
Can you come with me?

76
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,515
Leaving me aside...

77
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:49,156
Doctor Tenma, you don't need
to get involved any further.

78
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:54,993
No. I also have something I want to
ask the Czechoslovakian secret police.

79
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:58,699
What are you trying to do?

80
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:07,412
Well, the question is whether we
can negotiate with these guys.

81
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:22,929
You're not inviting us to dinner,
are you?

82
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,564
Welcome. ..
Come right this way.

83
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:33,373
That man...

84
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:37,305
Apparently, he's an important figure
with the Czechoslovakian secret police.

85
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:39,645
Yeah. I looked him up at
the newspaper company.

86
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:41,444
Captain Karel Lanke...

87
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:43,844
So the big boss
has finally appeared.

88
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:50,255
I'm very sorry that my subordinates
were rough with you.

89
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:54,728
This unintended situation was the result
of an error within our chain of command.

90
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:01,027
We have been terribly
misunderstood... by you and the world.

91
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:04,895
We're viewed as
a gang of killers.

92
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:07,240
Where's Suk?

93
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:11,844
He's at one of our hospitals.
His life isn't in danger.

94
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:13,973
I'm tired of people telling me
that this is a misunderstanding.

95
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:18,583
We haven't killed anyone.

96
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:19,753
What about that woman?

97
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:20,847
Woman?

98
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:25,318
Wasn't that blonde woman
acting on your orders?

99
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:29,627
I've received information on her,
but she isn't involved with us.

100
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:32,327
She's been quite
an inconvenience to us, too.

101
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:35,368
We don't want peoples' lives.

102
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:40,164
A German friend wanted
that tape and the data.

103
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:44,144
We've been carefully
negotiating with Pedrov.

104
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:46,706
That's when he was killed.

105
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,075
There must have been
a lot of money involved.

106
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:54,986
Yes. This is a business.
I just want to talk business.

107
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,925
I want that tape and data
in return for Suk.

108
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:01,126
I don't know where it is.

109
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:03,730
Let's not talk like that.

110
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:11,963
We mustn't let that
happen again.

111
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:16,700
If such a thing was in the world,
who knows what would happen?

112
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:20,877
We mustn't let that happen again.

113
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:23,808
Let's not talk about things
like that for now.

114
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:27,154
It doesn't have anything to do
with our current discussion.

115
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,056
I'm a graduate.

116
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,596
I'm a graduate
of 511 Kinderheim.

117
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:45,602
How old are you?

118
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:49,168
When did you leave that place?

119
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:55,177
I was supposedly fourteen,
but that was 30 years ago.

120
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:56,783
When were you placed there?

121
00:09:56,884 --> 00:09:59,979
Who knows?
I was probably seven or eight.

122
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:02,684
Around 1963, right?

123
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:03,982
Who knows?

124
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:08,495
Do you know this boy?

125
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,631
He's my nephew.

126
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:17,328
In the early 60s,

127
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:20,999
I was officially stationed in Berlin
as an intelligence officer

128
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:23,703
for the Czechoslovakian
ambassador.

129
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:27,912
I had a younger sister.
She married a German.

130
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:30,994
But my younger sister
and her husband

131
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:32,884
plotted to defect and
cross the Berlin Wall.

132
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:34,045
They were shot dead.

133
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:37,483
Their child was all that
was left of their family.

134
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:40,859
I signed him up.

135
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:45,255
I heard that it was
a wonderful place.

136
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:52,437
An ideal educational environment
to educate children with dubious pasts

137
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:54,565
into the future communist elite.

138
00:10:56,677 --> 00:11:03,447
I signed him up to be put
into 511 Kinderheim.

139
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:06,786
I don't know him.

140
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,351
I have no memories.

141
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:15,789
I can't remember what happened
there or what happened before that.

142
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:19,592
I can't even remember
my real name.

143
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:22,202
You're...

144
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:26,541
You're trying to make money
on something horrible.

145
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:29,906
You're trying to sell
the information

146
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:32,105
that includes experimental data
on your own nephew!

147
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:38,649
We've got off topic.

148
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,383
I want you to approach this
in a business-like manner.

149
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:47,494
All right.

150
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:51,062
You may leave for today.

151
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:58,866
I await a favorable response.

152
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,908
Please give these gentlemen
a courteous farewell.

153
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:06,980
What are you going to do?

154
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:10,312
Right now, saving Suk
is what's important.

155
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:14,544
I think he'll release Suk if
we give him what he wants.

156
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:22,362
Mr. Grimmer...

157
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,997
Hot Cocoa...

158
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:29,736
I remembered.

159
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:33,506
I remembered!

160
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:37,603
Mr. Grimmer!

161
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:46,584
Our weekly hot cocoa... He
looked forward to getting hot cocoa!

162
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:54,120
When I got a fever and
slept in the infirmary,

163
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:55,525
he brought me hot cocoa.

164
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:59,297
His hot cocoa.. .
Even though he liked it so much.

165
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:04,805
It was delicious. It was the first time
I had hot cocoa that was so delicious.

166
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:08,303
So I wanted to thank him
in some way.

167
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:14,578
That's when he said,
"remember me."

168
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:18,083
Back then, we all did that.

169
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,147
We talked about each other
to our friends.

170
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:24,048
I don't really know why,

171
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:28,891
but our memories would fade
day-by-day at these strange lessons.

172
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:32,599
We could hardly
remember our names.

173
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,459
That's why.. .
That's why...

174
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:38,667
We had our friends
remember who we were!

175
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:43,837
He loved hot cocoa,
drawing pictures, and bugs!

176
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:47,572
But he didn't like bug collections
because you have to kill the bugs!

177
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:49,411
The most enjoyable
time he had

178
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:51,144
was when he went to the forest
with his parents.

179
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:52,576
He caught
a lot of butterflies!

180
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,983
But when he went home, he let
the butterflies out of the bug cage.

181
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:58,949
His dream was to
become an entomologist!

182
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:04,623
His...

183
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:10,194
His name was Adolf Reinhart!

184
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:20,170
That was my nephew.

185
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:36,529
<i>Welcome home.</i>

186
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,101
<i>Don't keep secrets from him.</i>

187
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:57,850
<i>People can become
anything they want to be.</i>

188
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:02,246
<i>Cheers!</i>

189
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,024
<i>Hey, welcome home.</i>

190
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:10,059
<i>Hey, welcome home.</i>

191
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:12,495
<i>Hey, welcome home.</i>

192
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:19,337
What's wrong, Nina?

193
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:20,499
I...

194
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:24,009
I know this place.

195
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:27,208
The road leading up to here...

196
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:29,739
This scenery...

197
00:15:32,986 --> 00:15:33,953
This sign...

198
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:36,156
I know all of it.

199
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,953
Did you live here?

200
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:41,159
I don't know. But...

201
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:42,321
But?

202
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,197
I'm afraid.

203
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,604
Do you also know this door?

204
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:54,774
I don't know. But...

205
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,703
I'm afraid.

206
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:21,098
I also know these stairs.

207
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:31,641
Mr. Grimmer,
I thought about this all night.

208
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:33,904
There's something
I want to tell you.

209
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:40,243
Doctor Tenma... That tape and
the data have nothing to do with you.

210
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,344
No, they do.

211
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:43,554
It looks like we don't
have time to talk.

212
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:47,190
They seem like they
can't wait to negotiate.

213
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:50,959
The former Czechoslovakian
secret police...

214
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:52,856
Have taken the time
to make an appearance.

215
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:58,604
Have you thought
everything through?

216
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:02,739
Yeah. I don't plan on handing over
the tape and the research data.

217
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:09,573
So you're saying that you don't care
what happens to Detective Suk?

218
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:11,846
If something
happens to Suk,

219
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,787
that tape and data will disappear
from this world forever.

220
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:18,820
Let's stop with such
trifling exchanges.

221
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:23,652
But I'll let you listen to the tape.

222
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,625
My condition is that
you forget doing business

223
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:32,365
with the German friend
who you plan on selling it to.

224
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:38,343
I'll let you listen to the tape
if you want to listen to it yourself.

225
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:41,581
No, you should listen to it.

226
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:45,850
For your nephew who was sent
to 511 Kinderheim, as well.

227
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,854
You should listen to Johan,
the boy on the tape.

228
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:53,656
Is that your deal?

229
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:56,224
I am not making a deal.

230
00:17:56,363 --> 00:17:57,387
Stop already.

231
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:00,559
Now's not the time
to be doing this.

232
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:06,462
As we speak, someone might be
killed because of that tape.

233
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:11,839
How many people involved with
the Czechoslovakian secret police

234
00:18:11,912 --> 00:18:13,402
have been killed?!

235
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:16,842
Who do you think killed them?!

236
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:20,352
The person who wants
the tape the most.

237
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:23,450
The person whose voice
was recorded.

238
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:25,491
Johan!

239
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:28,051
Doctor Tenma...

240
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,225
I don't know what
you're talking about.

241
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:32,856
Don't act dumb!

242
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:37,561
Your German friend should have
told you what kind of tape it is!

243
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,733
What did he tell you to obtain?!

244
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,370
"The Monster's Identity."
That's all.

245
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,708
I didn't want to get you involved.

246
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:55,052
But I'll tell you everything.
Before anyone else is killed.

247
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,054
It happened ten years ago.

248
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,202
I see. So Johan has come to Prague
in search of his roots.

249
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:18,741
I don't know. He might be
trying to erase of all of it.

250
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,781
What in the world did you
do to him 15 years ago?!

251
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:27,347
A mother and her child lived near
Cedok Bridge in the Mikalska District.

252
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:30,787
One day, they were taken away
by the secret police.

253
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:32,848
What did you do to Johan

254
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:35,657
when you took him from the building
with the sign with three frogs?!

255
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,360
These stairs...

256
00:19:43,537 --> 00:19:44,868
<i>Big brother...</i>

257
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:48,773
What's wrong, Nina?

258
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:54,141
Dragged down these steps
and taken away...

259
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:55,274
Who was?

260
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:58,543
Big brother?

261
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,846
Indeed,
during that time,

262
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:04,255
I was in a position where I could
get all the information I wanted.

263
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:08,494
But the three frogs. ..
Taking away a mother and child...

264
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:10,627
I don't remember that at all.

265
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:11,864
Don't act dumb!

266
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:16,694
Even so, there was information
that even I didn't receive.

267
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:18,965
Things that man did...

268
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:22,199
We didn't know which branch
of the secret police he belonged to.

269
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:26,741
Or even what chain of
command he followed.

270
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:33,784
He could freely detain many people
for whatever reason without reporting it.

271
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:37,289
What was he doing?

272
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:44,156
He was only a captain, but he was
granted a luxurious mansion to work in.

273
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:45,524
Yes.

274
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,864
He was called
"the Man of Red Rose Mansion."

275
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:52,633
Are you saying
that man was involved?

276
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:57,032
He was a very elegant
and quiet man.

277
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:01,142
He didn't wear a uniform
and liked tea and cake.

278
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:02,940
What was that man's name?!

279
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:05,885
Franz Bonaparta.

280
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:08,848
Franz. .. Bonaparta...

281
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:14,689
But I don't know if it was his
real name. He used a pseudonym.

282
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:16,496
A pseudonym?

283
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:19,229
He also wrote picture books.

284
00:21:24,104 --> 00:21:25,572
Are you afraid of this door?

285
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:26,939
I...

286
00:21:29,643 --> 00:21:32,908
I was reading
a picture book in here.

287
00:21:35,615 --> 00:21:36,980
The door opened.

288
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:39,777
Someone came back.

289
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:46,492
Picture book?

290
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,086
Yes. It was a strange picture book.

291
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:52,160
It was called,
<i>The Nameless Monster.</i>

292
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:58,333
There's nothing here, Nina.

293
00:22:01,341 --> 00:22:04,242
What's with this memory?

294
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:08,480
I was reading
a picture book here.

295
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:14,246
But the one who opened the door
and came back.. .was me.

296
00:22:23,363 --> 00:22:26,697
I was greeting myself?

297
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:33,206
<i>Welcome home.</i>
