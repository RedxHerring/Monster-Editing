1
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:12,692
<i>If I had known this
was going to happen...</i>

2
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:19,767
<i>I never would have
taken that job.</i>

3
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:29,315
<i>I didn't like it
from the beginning.</i>

4
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:42,194
It'll be all right! Relax!

5
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:46,557
Th-That wound is nothing!

6
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:48,299
We'll be at the hospital soon!

7
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:51,995
I told you it's not a hospital.

8
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:55,632
He's a doctor,
but it's not a hospital.

9
00:00:57,111 --> 00:00:58,374
The Helbrau Hotel...

10
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:01,205
I-I know what
you're trying to say!

11
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,744
If we go to a doctor, the police will
come and you'll go to prison again!

12
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,747
But, unfortunately, we don't have
the time to go to that unlicensed doctor!

13
00:01:10,258 --> 00:01:12,386
Go to the Helbrau. ..Hotel.

14
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:14,659
Prison or your life!
As long as you're alive, you can.

15
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:15,924
Hurry up!

16
00:01:15,997 --> 00:01:17,431
The Helbrau Hotel!

17
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:32,106
<i>This is why. ..nothing good comes
from dealing with women.</i>

18
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:38,986
I'm begging you, hurry.
Take me to Doctor Tenma.

19
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:13,673
Don't be rude.

20
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:18,679
The person we're going to meet
usually doesn't see people like you.

21
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:21,656
In that case, I should have
brought an autograph book.

22
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:25,989
If you fool around,
I'll kill you.

23
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:33,493
<i>Come in.</i>

24
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:45,042
This man is Martin,
my subordinate.

25
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,804
You can leave now.

26
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:47,640
Huh?

27
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:51,175
I'm saying that I want to speak
with this man in private.

28
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,087
Oh.Yes.

29
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:59,157
If you really screw up,
I'll kill you.

30
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,444
May I sit here?

31
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:19,038
Go right ahead.

32
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:34,891
How long have you been
with "The Baby"?

33
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,126
It's been almost three years.

34
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:39,433
What about before that?

35
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,507
Prison, huh?
How many years?

36
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:48,041
Eight years.

37
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:49,276
Murder?

38
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:50,444
Pretty much.

39
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:53,676
Despite that,
you've gotten out pretty quickly.

40
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:55,914
I was well behaved.

41
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:59,578
You also seem to be well behaved
when it comes to your work.

42
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:06,619
I'll do anything.
Whatever job. Except...

43
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:08,021
Except?

44
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:10,726
Except any job
that involves women.

45
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:11,724
Oh?

46
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:18,795
Well, I don't choose my jobs, but I
don't want to get involved with women.

47
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:20,538
It involves a woman.

48
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:26,045
I want you to keep watch over
a certain woman for a while.

49
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:30,079
<i>What a terrible job.</i>

50
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:35,254
I want you to go to Düsseldorf
and bring me a certain woman.

51
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,490
You say that you don't want to
get involved with women?

52
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:43,594
Then this job is perfect for you.

53
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:47,557
You seem like you'll be more
professional about this job.

54
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:00,440
Ms. Eva Heinemann?

55
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:02,783
Who are you?

56
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:07,547
Martin...
Well, my name doesn't matter.

57
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:11,124
I was told to take you
to Frankfurt.

58
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:12,051
By whom?

59
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:15,593
A man with glasses
who wore a nice suit.

60
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:19,390
A man with glasses?
He's not with Roberto, is he?

61
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:24,061
I'm not too sure.
He seems to be important.

62
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:26,870
I won't force you to go
if you don't want to.

63
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,170
I'm not too enthusiastic
about this either.

64
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,877
Someone's after me right now.

65
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:37,010
Oh?

66
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:39,184
Will you be my bodyguard?

67
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:42,586
Well, that's kind of
part of my job, so...

68
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:43,891
Wait for me.

69
00:06:49,397 --> 00:06:50,023
Carry this!

70
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:57,861
Let's go. This is better than
being killed by that man.

71
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:03,076
<i>What an unpleasant woman.</i>

72
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:07,306
<i>The way she swings her hips.. .
The smell of her perfume...</i>

73
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:09,874
<i>It's annoying.</i>

74
00:07:15,923 --> 00:07:17,084
<i>What a terrible job.</i>

75
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:22,797
Why don't you talk?

76
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,029
Well... If that's what you want.
What shall we talk about?

77
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,230
I don't really want to talk.

78
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,429
Then let's be quiet.

79
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:39,279
How about a drink?

80
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:41,440
Do you have any alcohol?

81
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:43,877
Unfortunately, I don't drink.

82
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:46,683
I'm going to
check the dining car.

83
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:13,606
I see. You're traveling alone.

84
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:16,849
I'm by myself, too.

85
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:20,984
Well, if it's all right, could you
tell me where you're staying?

86
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:23,551
Oh, this is my card.

87
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:27,951
What are you doing?

88
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:29,323
W-What am I doing?

89
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:31,656
This woman told me
to give her a drink.

90
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,259
Don't touch her.

91
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:15,434
Why aren't you talking
while we eat?

92
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,277
Like I said,
I'll talk if you like.

93
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,845
Why haven't you
had anything to drink?

94
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,644
My mom was
a terrible alcoholic.

95
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,752
Well, I don't mind if you drink.

96
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,524
Your mother probably
had a good reason to drink.

97
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:34,261
You think so?

98
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:38,594
Yes. I also have
a good reason to drink.

99
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:45,964
Well, tell me about it if you don't
want to eat in silence.

100
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:48,667
It will take a while.

101
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,202
Please, go right ahead.

102
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:59,852
I had a fiancé.

103
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:03,680
He was a Japanese
neurosurgeon.

104
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:07,116
He was brilliant.

105
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:19,730
Then...

106
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:25,103
Then I tried to shoot
my ex-fiancé.

107
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:31,382
Aren't you surprised?
I tried to kill him!

108
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:33,547
But you didn't shoot.

109
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:38,020
It's better than my story.

110
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:42,888
What is your story?
Tell me.

111
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:47,091
I shot her.

112
00:10:48,435 --> 00:10:51,461
I saw my girlfriend straddling
another man.

113
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:56,605
I shot the both of them until
I was out of bullets.

114
00:10:58,612 --> 00:11:00,102
The room was filled with

115
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:03,947
the smell of her blood,
his blood and the scent of perfume.

116
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:09,350
When I came to my senses,
I was standing there by myself.

117
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:14,594
You are such a fool.

118
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:15,822
Aren't I?

119
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,947
<i>What a terrible job.</i>

120
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:23,926
My client is waiting
in this hotel.

121
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,993
You said you killed someone.

122
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:30,193
Don't touch me.

123
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,098
What room?

124
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:35,298
I'll take you to him.

125
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:38,901
Your attire. ..
doesn't match this hotel.

126
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:40,774
Wait here.

127
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:43,550
It's room 1014.

128
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:01,427
<i>What a terrible woman.</i>

129
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:13,307
<i>I don't know what the man
with glasses is going to tell her,</i>

130
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,284
<i>but if she turns him down,
this terrible job will be over.</i>

131
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,587
<i>I won't have to
see her anymore.</i>

132
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:34,694
What's wrong?
You don't look well.

133
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:37,700
It wasn't such a bad proposal.

134
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
He said that I could use
this card as much as I like.

135
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:49,208
What are you doing?
We're going now.

136
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,575
Going? Where?

137
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:55,279
Shopping.

138
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,618
<i>What a truly terrible job.</i>

139
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:46,033
This place next.

140
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:47,807
This is a men's store.

141
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:51,308
I have to make you look
somewhat decent as well.

142
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:53,474
This is good enough for me.

143
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:58,775
I don't like it. I don't want the man
accompanying me to look unsightly.

144
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,846
This is good.

145
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:05,217
And for your tie...

146
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,967
Kenzo...

147
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:17,702
Try it on.

148
00:15:27,548 --> 00:15:30,074
<i>A tie... How awful.</i>

149
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,780
How is it?

150
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:34,854
Well...

151
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:36,956
Hmm.. .
You look somewhat decent.

152
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,087
But.. .tie your tie properly.

153
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:55,199
Stop walking with your shoulders
slouched like a thug.

154
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:57,868
I'm walking normally.

155
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:00,410
Your idea of normal
is not normal.

156
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:04,042
From now on,
you're escorting me.

157
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:08,983
Wherever we go,
make sure you don't embarrass me.

158
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,593
It's your job, isn't it?

159
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:18,261
<i>Yes.. .that's my job.</i>

160
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:23,030
Don't put your elbows
on the table.

161
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,235
Fork in your left hand,
knife in the right.

162
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:32,973
Don't make sounds
when you eat.

163
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:36,513
So it's true.

164
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:37,676
What is?

165
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:39,479
What you told me.

166
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:42,847
You told me that you were the daughter
of the director of a large hospital.

167
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,385
Did you think I was lying?

168
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:46,754
Until I brought you
to this town, yes.

169
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:49,394
You looked like nothing more
than an alcoholic.

170
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:51,030
Were you wrong?

171
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:53,027
You thoroughly look
the part of a rich woman.

172
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:55,963
This is my true form.

173
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,200
Eva Heinemann has returned
to the place where she belongs.

174
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:07,180
What is that?

175
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:09,082
An invitation to a party.

176
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:10,109
A party?

177
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:13,183
Yes. It's the job I was given.

178
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,446
Job?

179
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:19,016
I have to attend several parties.
That's all.

180
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:23,760
Aren't you glad?
It seems like a fun job.

181
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:24,988
You're coming with me.

182
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:30,528
You must escort me as
someone worthy of me.

183
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:36,072
<i>This job getting more
and more terrible.</i>

184
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:02,761
What do you think?

185
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,073
How does it feel to be back
in your stomping grounds?

186
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:30,957
<i>What's so funny?</i>

187
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,792
<i>What are the people gathered
here talking about?</i>

188
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,739
<i>The weather? Stocks?</i>

189
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:44,634
<i>I don't even know what
language they're speaking.</i>

190
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,581
<i>I'm starting to feel sick.</i>

191
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,753
So there you are.

192
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:06,961
Yeah. Don't mind me.
Enjoy yourself.

193
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:07,760
We're going.

194
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:08,894
Huh?

195
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:10,169
We're leaving.

196
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:13,768
Huh? Oh. Hold on.

197
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:17,838
He's not at this party.
The job's over.

198
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:19,971
He's not here?
Who's not?

199
00:19:20,113 --> 00:19:21,080
Take me away from here!

200
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,386
Anywhere is fine.
Just take me away from here quickly

201
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:32,483
<i>Why was the woman's hand
trembling?</i>

202
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:38,825
<i>I didn't know at that time.</i>

203
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:51,470
I managed to survive today.

204
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:53,646
What's wrong?

205
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:57,816
Didn't you return to the place
where you belong?

206
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,880
In the past,
I lived like that every day.

207
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:09,386
Once I entered that world, I
thought that the real me would return.

208
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:16,703
But now you only find bars
like this relaxing?

209
00:20:17,037 --> 00:20:18,835
I don't belong here either!

210
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:21,363
Not here, not there!

211
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,710
No matter where I go,
there's no place where I belong!

212
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:25,602
I know that!

213
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:37,049
Once this job is over,
I'll probably be killed.

214
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:46,990
I thought it would be better than being killed
by Roberto in Düsseldorf in a shabby state.

215
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:53,134
I thought it would be better to be killed
as the beautifully attired Eva Heinemann.

216
00:20:56,276 --> 00:21:00,372
But it's all the same
if you're dead.

217
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,220
<i>I thought that
I should protect her.</i>

218
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:18,856
<i>My bad habit came back.</i>

219
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:25,571
<i>I wound up thinking that
I should protect her.</i>

220
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:58,400
Damn. How in the world
did this happen?

221
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:04,070
Th-That's what I'm going
to go tell Dr. Tenma.

222
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:09,013
G-Get a hold of yourself!
We're close! We're almost there!

223
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:22,726
A tie... If I didn't have this,
I wouldn't have had to go there.

224
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:29,393
I wouldn't have had to
see such a terrifying thing.
