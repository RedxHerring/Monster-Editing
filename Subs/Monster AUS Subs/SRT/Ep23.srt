1
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,166
Get out!

2
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:16,098
Leave me alone.

3
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:19,231
What are you talking about?
Wake up!

4
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:23,978
Jeez, you're hopeless.
This isn't a hotel!

5
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:25,338
What?

6
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:27,737
Don't touch me!

7
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:33,345
Don't you know who I am?

8
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:04,412
Here. These are your belongings.

9
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:07,838
Make sure everything's there
and sign this form.

10
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,647
Eva Heinemann... Don't come to
this drunk tank ever again.

11
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:18,415
You got drunk and fell asleep
in a back alley.

12
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,985
Just be thankful that you're safe!

13
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:22,896
Got a cigarette?

14
00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:23,990
Huh?

15
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,961
I'm asking if you have a cigarette.

16
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,475
You can't smoke in the station.
Go outside if you want to smoke.

17
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:04,628
Lighter...

18
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:06,701
Where's my lighter?

19
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:10,437
My bag!

20
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:14,107
Where are you keeping my bag?!

21
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,983
That's the only bag you had.

22
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:21,177
You're lying! I had
a large shoulder bag!

23
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:25,182
Someone probably stole it from you
when you passed out in that alley.

24
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:26,754
What are you going to do about it?!

25
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:28,596
I had valuables in there!!

26
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:30,330
Anyway...

27
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:32,866
Want to fill out a robbery report?

28
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:35,699
But I don't think it'll do you any good.

29
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,403
You lost your keys?

30
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:46,778
My bag was stolen.

31
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:48,645
Open this door already!

32
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:52,479
Huh?

33
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:56,349
W-What is this?!!

34
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:02,222
Goodness...you've been robbed.

35
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:06,627
What a bother.
I've got to change the lock.

36
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:10,634
Anyway, Ms. Heinemann,
I asked you about it the other day,

37
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:12,104
but about the rent...

38
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,767
The money you paid in advance
has already run out.

39
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,200
I need you to pay the rest.

40
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:20,237
My suitcases have been pried open.

41
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:22,310
Are you listening?

42
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,578
The remainder of the rent
and the fee to change the lock.

43
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:28,152
I don't have any money.

44
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:29,281
Huh?

45
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,817
I just have to get out, don't I?!

46
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:36,558
What an unfortunate incident.

47
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,800
So, you want me to help you?

48
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:44,635
You're the one who said you didn't
want so see me anymore and left.

49
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:49,107
It's been a while since we met.
At least get me a drink.

50
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:53,406
Hey, Eva, even if your bag was stolen,

51
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:55,973
it's not as if you don't
have any money, right?

52
00:04:57,018 --> 00:05:00,784
I've never seen anyone spend money
the way you do.

53
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:03,884
You'll never have enough.

54
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:06,985
Whatever the case,
you've run out of money, right?

55
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:08,228
How much will you pay?

56
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,656
Huh?!

57
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,188
I'll sleep with you.

58
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,026
I'm asking you how much you'll pay.

59
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,038
You idiot!

60
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:22,937
What kind of man would pay to sleep
with a woman he's already slept with?

61
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:27,672
Get me a drink.

62
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:30,111
Stand on the streets around there.

63
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:33,950
Someone interested
may buy you.

64
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:37,358
Even if you are
a middle-aged alcoholic!

65
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:20,761
I'm sure that you didn't leave it here.

66
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:23,101
Are you sure you didn't leave it
at the place you went to afterwards?

67
00:06:23,337 --> 00:06:25,669
I don't remember anything
after this place.

68
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:29,008
You said that something important
was in that bag,

69
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:31,704
but if it's something of value,
you should forget about it.

70
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:36,410
It's not worth any money.

71
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,380
Any money.

72
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:49,757
Hey, I've been looking for you.

73
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,056
I was just at that pub there.

74
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,329
I heard that you went this way.

75
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:57,838
Who are you?

76
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:02,773
Come on... We had such a fun time
drinking last night.

77
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,538
I went drinking with you?

78
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,575
Here's your bag.
I've been meaning to give it to you.

79
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,151
Oh. I guess this means that I should
introduce myself once more.

80
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,917
I'm Roberto. Care to have lunch
somewhere around here?

81
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:23,159
That's horrible.

82
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:25,564
Your hotel room was ransacked?

83
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:28,198
But it doesn't seem like you did it.

84
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:32,167
Of course. I haven't even
opened your bag.

85
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:34,834
My key is in here.

86
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,008
But I no longer have a use for this key.

87
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,038
Sorry. You wouldn't have been
thrown out of your hotel

88
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:44,141
if I had given you your bag earlier.

89
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:45,984
It's not your fault.

90
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:50,680
Besides, I'm thankful that
you gave me back my bag.

91
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:53,593
I'm thankful for that bag.

92
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:54,520
Huh?

93
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:59,399
I never thought I would see you again
when you left your bag

94
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:05,429
at the pub last night, but thanks to
that bag, here we are, together again.

95
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,443
You had something important in there,
didn't you?

96
00:08:09,877 --> 00:08:10,503
Yeah.

97
00:08:15,182 --> 00:08:17,241
This is all that I have left.

98
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:21,356
Oh, an album, huh?
Mind if I take a look at it?

99
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:22,381
Go right ahead.

100
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:29,824
That is my father.

101
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:34,496
What a great man.
He was a hospital director, right?

102
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:36,935
Did I tell you that last night?

103
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:39,772
Yes. You told me that
you admired him a lot.

104
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:42,070
He died ten years ago, right?

105
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:44,271
You were very upset about it
when you told me last night.

106
00:08:46,614 --> 00:08:49,709
And...ah...this is your ex-fiancé.

107
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:53,377
I told you about that as well?

108
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:56,889
Yes I believe he was
called Tenma or something.

109
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,387
You still can't forget him?

110
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:02,924
What did I say last night?

111
00:09:03,597 --> 00:09:04,962
You should forget about him already.

112
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,465
I was a little jealous.

113
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:13,639
There's nothing on this page.

114
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,842
Oh, really?

115
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:18,038
Something was here.

116
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:19,575
There are tear marks.

117
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:22,943
They were photographs I didn't need,
so I tore them out.

118
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:24,746
I see.

119
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:25,978
Say.

120
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:29,584
Want to go drinking?

121
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:31,658
That sounds good.

122
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:41,427
Is that so...?
You had a security company.

123
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:44,203
Yes. In Nice, in Southern France.

124
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:51,203
But then a long-time client
I was guarding was killed.

125
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:53,512
So I closed the company.

126
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:57,048
We're both having tough times.

127
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:59,850
Let's forget about it.
Now's what's important!

128
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,555
We have to enjoy ourselves.

129
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:11,731
This song.

130
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:13,124
It's AI Green.

131
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:15,495
Do you also like this song?

132
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:16,562
Yeah.

133
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:18,662
Let's dance.

134
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,050
What's wrong?

135
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:32,481
No, I'm no good at dancing.

136
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:35,447
Put your arms around my waist.

137
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:41,554
Yes.

138
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:46,922
I knew a man who loved this song,
but who was no good at dancing.

139
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:50,804
So...is this what he always did?

140
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:53,099
Yeah.

141
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,248
Oh, how fun!

142
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:04,377
Would you like another drink?

143
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:06,651
No, that's enough.

144
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:08,849
You sure are weak!

145
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,854
Shall we go to bed?

146
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:14,922
Yeah. Sounds good to me.

147
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:25,500
Before that, there's just one thing
I have to ask you.

148
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:26,332
What's that?

149
00:11:27,174 --> 00:11:29,268
Where's the photograph?

150
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:31,344
What photograph?

151
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:36,816
Don't act dumb!!

152
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:44,385
The photograph you tore
out of the album.

153
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:45,617
Where have you hidden it?

154
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:47,587
Huh?

155
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,265
I'll tell you if you give me
the photograph.

156
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,795
You're looking for Tenma,
aren't you?

157
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:56,829
What?!

158
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:01,505
I know that you haven't burnt
that photograph. You have it with you.

159
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,875
Y-You know where Tenma is?!

160
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,247
Yeah.

161
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:16,554
The photograph you're talking about...

162
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:20,017
It's the one with the boy in it, right?

163
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:22,225
His name is Johan.

164
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:31,764
I saw him. He's become
quite a handsome blond.

165
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:35,868
I saw him a year ago in Düsseldorf.

166
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:42,349
<i>Kenzo...</i>

167
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,482
<i>I want to start over!</i>

168
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,753
<i>You have to be with me.</i>

169
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,261
<i>Kenzo...</i>

170
00:12:58,065 --> 00:12:59,794
<i>You're mine.</i>

171
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:04,494
<i>I'll take you back once more.</i>

172
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:09,804
<i>Because you're mine.</i>

173
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:15,808
So...

174
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:17,873
What are you up to right now?

175
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,580
I've heard all sorts of rumors.

176
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,190
The rumors are right.

177
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,055
I've been married and divorced
three times.

178
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,224
I live well off of
my father's inheritance and alimony.

179
00:13:31,131 --> 00:13:33,828
What about you?
How are you doing, Dr. Becker?

180
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:35,729
Huh? Me?

181
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:39,833
I'm the same as always.
I still have no chance at a promotion.

182
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:43,005
Speaking of moving up,
Tenma is the chief of surgery.

183
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,738
It's been said that he's going to
become the director.

184
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:47,545
He's gotten quite ahead of me.

185
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:52,876
But this is still pretty fun.
Life isn't all about getting promoted.

186
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,379
I'd hate to be wrapped up in my work

187
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:59,289
and not have the time for women
or fun like Tenma.

188
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:02,929
Kenzo...

189
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:06,696
Dr. Tenma hasn't
gotten married yet?

190
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:11,703
That's right. I've introduced him
to lots of women.

191
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,100
His work comes first.
He just isn't interested.

192
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:20,838
Oh yeah, so I set him up
on another date.

193
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:23,079
She's the daughter
of a state senator.

194
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,049
She's a beauty! If this girl
isn't good enough, then I give up!

195
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:33,251
So why did you want to see me, Eva?

196
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:38,662
As the ex-director's daughter, you
never paid attention to me before.

197
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:43,059
I never thought that
you'd want to see me.

198
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:49,299
I understand. You're well off,
but you're lonely, aren't you?

199
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,609
I'll help you out any time.

200
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:55,839
I don't want you to let him meet her.

201
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:56,876
Huh?

202
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:00,086
That state senator's daughter.

203
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:02,787
Don't let Kenzo meet her.

204
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:07,652
Could it be that you're
still in love with Tenma?

205
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,057
Please.

206
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:40,126
Be sure to make her yours this time!

207
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:42,361
I went out of my way to set this up.

208
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:46,124
I won't know until I meet her.

209
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:53,673
Oh, this is it!!

210
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:57,567
This is the clock that Mr. Junkers
was talking about at the hospital!

211
00:16:00,147 --> 00:16:02,582
Excuse me! About that clock
in the show window...

212
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:03,980
Hey, what's with that?

213
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,079
It's already time to meet her. Hey!

214
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,005
What a wonderful watch.

215
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:37,450
Who are you?

216
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:41,246
My watch is just an accessory.

217
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:43,883
I no longer look at the time anymore.

218
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:49,952
I wonder why it seems like
time is moving faster.

219
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:53,663
Umm... Excuse me,
but who are you?

220
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:58,899
You're Angelica, the daughter
of Senator Belgar, aren't you?

221
00:16:59,306 --> 00:16:59,932
Yes.

222
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,608
You're very beautiful...and young.

223
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:06,078
Oh, no...umm...

224
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,180
You think that the whole world
revolves around you.

225
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:13,478
Huh?

226
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:19,485
You don't think that there's anything
that you can't have, don't you?

227
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:26,124
Umm... What are you trying to say?
Just who are you?

228
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,461
I have a mole on my inner thigh.

229
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:32,930
He used to kiss it.

230
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:40,412
Dr. Kenzo Tenma would
always kiss that spot.

231
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:52,818
Oh, no.

232
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,028
Look! Going into that store
made you late.

233
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:58,794
She left.

234
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:02,460
Well, I see. I'm sorry about that.

235
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,170
Could you apologize for me?

236
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:08,537
Huh? Oh. Hey!

237
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:18,547
She'll feel better
if you call her right now.

238
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:20,181
Come on. Hey!

239
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:23,250
I want to go to the hospital for a bit.

240
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,685
Work, again?!

241
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,289
Cut it out!

242
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:33,063
Jeez.

243
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,023
<i>Kenzo...</i>

244
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:01,317
<i>Mine...</i>

245
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,323
<i>You're mine!</i>

246
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,566
Mr. Junkers!

247
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,434
Wait!

248
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:13,362
Mr. Junkers!

249
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:19,271
Kenzo?

250
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:20,773
What's wrong?

251
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:22,941
Wait...

252
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:23,842
Kenzo!!

253
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:25,676
There's something I want to tell you!!

254
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,280
Mr. Junkers!!

255
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:34,989
Kenzo! Please, wait!!

256
00:19:54,581 --> 00:19:55,548
Kenzo...

257
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:19,639
My high heel...

258
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:35,947
Kenzo!

259
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:05,084
Kenzo?

260
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:40,443
I saw him...

261
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:46,522
One year ago in Düsseldorf.

262
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:49,029
That was Johan, wasn't it?!

263
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:16,155
You saw Johan, huh?

264
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,491
I guess...I should kill you.
