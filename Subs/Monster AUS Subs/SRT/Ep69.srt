1
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:16,665
This jam is really delicious.

2
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:21,274
Thank you very much.
It's homemade lingonberry jam.

3
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:22,901
My, homemade!

4
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:28,240
I was asked to show this to
customers who particularly enjoy it.

5
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:30,682
This is the maker of the jam.

6
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:32,478
Oh, this person?

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,845
His name is Conrad.

8
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,884
There's a place on the southern hill
where a lot of lingonberries grow.

9
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:44,425
Before we knew it,
that whole area was his.

10
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:49,766
But no one complained because
he made such good jam?

11
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:55,606
Yes. He's a very pleasant man.
He's one of my few friends.

12
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:59,336
It was his idea to
show his picture.

13
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:05,247
It's his way of saying, please continue to
enjoy the Conrad-brand lingonberry jam.

14
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:10,449
That means that I have to
come back here for this jam.

15
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:11,853
That's right.

16
00:01:12,894 --> 00:01:16,728
He'd be pleased
you said that.

17
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:05,772
Is there really going to be
an attack on this peaceful town?

18
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,207
An attack...

19
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,403
There are other methods.

20
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:13,774
There was a case in which a
single gun annihilated an entire town.

21
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:17,777
1958, in Zweifelstadt.

22
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:21,384
There was a string of
serial murders in Lower Saxony.

23
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,453
The residents thought that
their neighbors might be serial killers

24
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:28,985
and were paranoid over
ordinary everyday occurrences.

25
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,361
Amidst the mass hysteria,

26
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:36,734
one of the residents obtained a gun
for self-defense and shot his neighbor.

27
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,767
No one could control
what followed.

28
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:44,233
A fire started in the town and
everyone held weapons by their side.

29
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,142
All of the residents killed each other.
There were no survivors.

30
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,148
Don't tell me that's going to
happen to this town.

31
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,387
We've got to stop it.. .
before that happens.

32
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:00,720
No.

33
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,665
It may have already begun.

34
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:18,239
Come on, give us your money!
You have some. Give it to us.

35
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:19,746
No, that money is for...

36
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:22,215
It's probably money for
your drunken dad's alcohol, right?

37
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,979
Drinking too much
isn't good for the body.

38
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:27,782
We're helping him.
Helping.

39
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,558
Hey, let's go eat
at the usual place.

40
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:32,252
All right.

41
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:33,293
Sounds good.

42
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:40,460
Boy...

43
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,029
You hate them, don't you?

44
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,636
You hate them so much that
you want to kill them, don't you?

45
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:56,809
Where are you going, dear?

46
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:59,386
I'm going to talk to Conrad.

47
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:01,589
Talk to him? How?

48
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,783
When we passed the cafe,

49
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:07,795
didn't you notice that Ralph, the owner,
and the customers were smiling at us?

50
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:12,255
That's because it was unusual
for them to see us together, right?

51
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,895
No. If they knew that we won
20 million marks on a lottery,

52
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:19,462
who knows what they'd do?

53
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:21,141
O-Oh no!

54
00:05:21,342 --> 00:05:27,008
So I think it's better to talk to him than
to continue to be suspicious of him!

55
00:05:27,448 --> 00:05:31,885
Well, Mr. Conrad might
know that I won the lottery.

56
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,186
Even so,
what are you going to do?

57
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:40,117
I'll pay him any amount
of money to keep him quiet.

58
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:42,494
But Conrad is greedy.

59
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:45,098
What if he keeps on asking
for money afterwards?

60
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:47,158
W-When that happens...

61
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:48,698
What'll we do
when that happens?!

62
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:52,231
I-I don't know.

63
00:05:57,278 --> 00:06:01,215
Was this the area where
he gathers lingonberries?

64
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:04,484
Dear...

65
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:08,551
Mr. Conrad's not such
a bad person, right dear?

66
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:10,086
Y-Yeah.

67
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:15,495
He's not the sort of person who would
ruin the luck we managed to seize, right?

68
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:17,923
Right, dear?

69
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:28,502
What's wrong?

70
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:36,116
D-D-Dear, did you...

71
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:37,845
It wasn't me.

72
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,388
Doing something
so irrevocable...

73
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:42,456
I said that it wasn't me!

74
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:44,321
Then who did this?!

75
00:06:44,392 --> 00:06:47,657
H-How would I know?! I've
never fired my gun since I bought it!

76
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:54,891
Shut up.

77
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:56,766
That dog sure is annoying.

78
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:58,704
Yeah.
It's getting on my nerves.

79
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:07,010
You seem in
high spirits today.

80
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:10,341
Did something good
happen to you?

81
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:12,880
He finally appeared.

82
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,852
What finally appeared?

83
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:20,417
The wonderful person who will
take me away from this town.

84
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:27,601
A drink...

85
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:29,069
A drink...

86
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:30,871
Crap...

87
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:38,236
The townspeople...
They ridicule me...

88
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:40,680
It's not funny at all.

89
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:51,525
A drink...

90
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:53,692
The thing that you want...

91
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:04,400
Could it be this?

92
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:13,706
Your son has
already taken one.

93
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:21,989
A gunshot.

94
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:27,791
The dog stopped barking.

95
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:42,973
That sure was interesting.

96
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:46,146
Mr. Lipsky.

97
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:51,449
You're Franz Bonaparta's son,
right?

98
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,347
Tell me where your father is.

99
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:56,347
There's not a moment to lose.

100
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:59,422
Something terrible will happen
if I don't hurry.

101
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:05,627
You know where your father is,
don't you, Mr. Lipsky?

102
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:11,870
That puppet is modeled
on Nina, isn't it?

103
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:17,072
Nina told me that
you were here.

104
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:18,635
Nina told you?

105
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:23,943
The curtain...

106
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:25,786
Please keep it open.

107
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:27,079
Okay.

108
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:30,858
How long have I
been like this?

109
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,527
Don't worry about that.

110
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:36,419
You should continue to rest.

111
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:43,226
Thank you. I get the feeling
that you stayed by my side.

112
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:51,209
Don't worry about me. I'm all right.
I won't try to kill myself.

113
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:56,176
Dr. Reichwein and Dieter
should be coming soon.

114
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:57,751
What about you?

115
00:09:58,419 --> 00:09:59,386
I've got to go.

116
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,646
Where to?

117
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:03,148
"Where to"' huh?

118
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:07,524
You've gathered a lot of material and
have been looking at it here, right?

119
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:10,055
Did you find something?

120
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,224
I'm okay, so tell me.

121
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:21,134
I've been having former
secret police in Prague

122
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,907
and General Wolf's subordinates
gather whatever information they could.

123
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:29,082
About Franz Bonaparta?

124
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:34,684
Yeah. He was a very mysterious person,
but little by little, I learned who he was.

125
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,822
He was a Czechoslovakian
of German decent.

126
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:41,185
Franz Bonaparta
is also an alias.

127
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:43,697
After World War Two,

128
00:10:43,764 --> 00:10:48,326
despite the fact that many
Czechoslovakians of German descent

129
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:51,597
were driven out of
their homeland, Bohemia.

130
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:54,805
His family remained
within the country.

131
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:56,572
It's not clear
what post he held

132
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:58,237
in the government in
Communist Czechoslovakia.

133
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:04,781
We know that he was once married to
a Czech woman and they had a child.

134
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:13,856
It seems that that child participated
in the early stages of his "recitals"

135
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:15,692
during the mid-sixties.

136
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:20,958
"Bonaparta has
a son in Prague."

137
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:27,065
I think that Peter Capek's
last words refer to this son.

138
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:29,740
I managed to
get a hold of this.

139
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:33,042
It's a copy of an old photograph
that shows the children

140
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:35,582
who participated in the "recitals"
in the mid-sixties.

141
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:40,197
It seems that the boy
to the far left...

142
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:41,950
Wasn't a superior pupil...

143
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,182
Huh?

144
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:47,852
He wasn't a superior pupil. ..
so he was expelled from the recitals.

145
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:49,287
You know him?

146
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,895
He became of no use
to Bonaparta.

147
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,635
He's probably the man
I know in Prague.

148
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:02,441
Do you think that this man knows
where his father.. .where Bonaparta is?

149
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:03,843
I don't know.

150
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,846
But he's our only lead.

151
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,680
If you don't hurry,
something terrible will happen.

152
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:12,185
Something terrible?

153
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,081
I know what Johan
is going to do.

154
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:18,491
What is he going to do?

155
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:20,755
A perfect suicide.

156
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:25,592
True solitude.
The only expression of love.

157
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:31,228
If you don't hurry,
many innocent people will die.

158
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,671
Your bookshelf...

159
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,844
It's filled with picture books that were
written under Bonaparta's pseudonyms.

160
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,574
I've also obtained and
read most of them.

161
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,589
After reading several,
I realized something.

162
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:52,554
For some reason, the characters in
his books have German names.

163
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,363
Even in Klaus Poppe's
The God of Peace...

164
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,269
But the issue is the pen name,
"Klaus Poppe."

165
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:06,936
Franz Bonaparta and his other
pen names are all Czech names...

166
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:10,333
But only this name is German.

167
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:19,280
Could it be that Klaus Poppe is your
German-born Czech father's real name?

168
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,223
There was a detective who
made the same deduction–

169
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:28,193
that it was my father's
real name.

170
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:29,522
A detective?

171
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:32,123
An Inspector Lunge
of the BKA.

172
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,557
Lunge?! He's here?

173
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:37,193
He left several weeks ago.

174
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:38,872
Left?

175
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:40,766
He also figured it out.

176
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:43,811
No, Inspector Lunge
becomes the person

177
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:45,845
rather than
making deductions.

178
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,273
"I am Klaus Poppe."

179
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:50,878
"I have no place
to go home to."

180
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:53,949
"In order to regain
my peace of mind"'

181
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:56,251
"I must return to my hometown
in my mind"' he said.

182
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,816
The German-born Czechs
were chased out of Bohemia

183
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:02,294
and lost their homeland
after the Germans lost.

184
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:05,661
Where in Germany were
his ancestors from?

185
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,699
I don't know the details.

186
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:12,705
But when I was a child,
my father told me that our home

187
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:16,641
was a town surrounded
by mountains in southern Germany.

188
00:14:18,612 --> 00:14:22,048
I didn't need that anymore,
so I gave it to Inspector Lunge.

189
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:25,952
A postcard that was sent to me
three or four years ago.

190
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,356
It was unsigned and
it has a hand-drawn picture

191
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:32,723
depicting a town
as seen from a mountain.

192
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:34,622
It was signed "K. P.".

193
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:36,629
K. P...

194
00:14:37,531 --> 00:14:39,431
Klaus.. .Poppe.

195
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,558
That is all I know.

196
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:46,062
Southern Germany...
A town surrounded by mountains...

197
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,407
My father...

198
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:50,342
Is my father
going to be killed?

199
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:52,045
I don't know.

200
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,311
But it won't end there.

201
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:55,749
Where's Nina?

202
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:57,684
Nina is safe, right?

203
00:14:58,285 --> 00:14:58,877
I...

204
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,645
I want this puppet show
to have a happy ending.

205
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,580
Please protect Nina.

206
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:05,751
Okay.

207
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:08,985
What in the world
is going to happen?

208
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:11,690
He's...

209
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:18,135
Johan is trying to recreate the atrocity
of the Red Rose Mansion...

210
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,731
the 511 Kinderheim Massacre.

211
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:22,802
Please...

212
00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:27,341
No matter what happens,
come back alive, Tenma.

213
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:30,380
You saved me.

214
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:32,475
So you must, too.

215
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:43,495
It's begun to rain.

216
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:58,209
A drink...

217
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,572
Give me a drink.

218
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:02,507
Crap...

219
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:11,480
How was it? Did the police
find Conrad's body yet?

220
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:15,555
No. They're still investigating
his disappearance.

221
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:18,862
We really shouldn't have
hidden him in the forest!

222
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:21,393
We should have informed
the police at that time.

223
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:22,958
What are you saying now?!

224
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:25,604
You're the one who thought
that I shot him!

225
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:28,904
Honestly. This happened
because you won the lottery.

226
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:32,404
Even so, you didn't have to
buy these things.

227
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,054
No matter how long you wait,
the train won't come.

228
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,759
All this rain flooded the railway bridge
over the Elgar River!

229
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:48,490
And the roads are closed
because of the river flooding.

230
00:16:51,365 --> 00:16:54,801
An isolated island.. .
This is the worst situation.

231
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,732
Klaus Poppe, huh?

232
00:16:58,105 --> 00:16:59,072
You know of him?

233
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,468
Jakub Farobek,
Emile Scherbe...

234
00:17:07,314 --> 00:17:11,080
I think they're
the same person as Poppe.

235
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:14,384
The drawing and literary styles
are different, though.

236
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:17,753
When you become an enthusiast
like me, you sort of know.

237
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:21,855
I don't know why he used
so many pen names, though.

238
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:23,425
His drawings are amusing.

239
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:26,960
But I can never like his pieces.

240
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:30,632
There are tons of picture books
in the world with dark content.

241
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:34,796
But his books are
a little different.

242
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:36,201
How are they different?

243
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,902
Hmm...

244
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:41,314
They're filled with malice.. .
I suppose.

245
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:45,281
Now, about that.

246
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:55,392
A picture book by Helmut Voss
was published in '89.

247
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:58,498
There were very few printed,
so you'll seldom see it.

248
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:02,900
But from what I can see, he's also
the same person as Klaus Poppe.

249
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:05,999
How do you know?

250
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,133
As I said, when you become like me,
you just know.

251
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,035
No matter how much
he changes his drawing style,

252
00:18:12,112 --> 00:18:14,342
there's always a certain
idiosyncrasy that remains.

253
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:17,751
The story is completely
different from the rest.

254
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:21,148
A thief flees to a town nestled
in the mountains.

255
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:24,949
The thief plans to make
some money in that town,

256
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:28,858
but as he interacts with the people
in the town, he forgets how to steal.

257
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:33,933
And he begins to work for the people
of the town and lives peacefully.

258
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:36,966
It's titled,
The Peaceful House.

259
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:40,468
The malice I used to get from
his books is completely gone.

260
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:43,974
But the art is no good at all.

261
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:49,682
It's odd. His story got better,
but he can't draw anymore.

262
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,280
It's as if he
lost sight of his goal.

263
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:58,481
A Peaceful Home. ..
A town nestled in the mountains...

264
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:04,924
<i>Our home was a town surrounded
by mountains in southern Germany.</i>

265
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:07,860
A map...

266
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:12,071
Do you have a map
of southern Germany?

267
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:16,242
What are you looking for?

268
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:19,105
A town nestled in the mountains
in southern Germany...

269
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:21,273
I found it.

270
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:25,676
Ruhenheim...

271
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:35,291
Honestly. It sure is raining.

272
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:40,063
Oh, how did it go? Did you find out
where Conrad went?

273
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,027
No. We don't have any idea.

274
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,797
My partners are searching
for him right now.

275
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:47,703
But with this rain...

276
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,076
I hear that
the train tracks and roads

277
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,838
aren't any good
because the river's flooded.

278
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:54,074
As his friend,
I'm sure you must be worried.

279
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:58,684
Honestly, what's going on?
It was such a peaceful town.

280
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:03,853
It started with Conrad going missing,
then Mrs. Hillman's dog was shot...

281
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:08,127
Poor Mrs. Hillman was
overcome with grief.

282
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:13,324
I heard that Mr. Kemnar was attacked
as he was leaving the pub.

283
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:15,596
I heard that he was
in serious condition.

284
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,895
We still don't know who hit him.

285
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:24,537
If Mr. Kemnar died, it would have
been the first murder in this town.

286
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:27,905
Though the situation is what it is,
back up won't come because of the rain.

287
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:30,407
What are we to do
with such few people?!

288
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:33,352
It's got to be an outsider!

289
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:36,188
There were never any crimes
in this town before!

290
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:37,988
It's the work of an outsider!

291
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:40,350
We're outsiders, too.

292
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:45,623
Well, you're...

293
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:47,526
It sure is raining.

294
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:51,871
I can't go outside in this rain
in a wheelchair.

295
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:59,542
Now then, I'm going to pick up
my partners and patrol once more.

296
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,238
Be careful.

297
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:13,518
Your husband's shoes.. .
they're pretty dirty.

298
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:17,486
It's as if he walked
around in the rain.

299
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,165
I'm going to borrow
your phone.

300
00:21:37,017 --> 00:21:38,451
It's that drunk.

301
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,050
He's not the sort
to do anything.

302
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:56,895
What's wrong?
Did you run out of gas?

303
00:21:57,838 --> 00:21:58,999
Or are you out of oil?

304
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,040
I'll call a repair shop.

305
00:22:11,518 --> 00:22:12,781
Another gunshot...

306
00:22:18,658 --> 00:22:20,126
The phone's dead.

307
00:22:24,197 --> 00:22:27,098
Is it too late to stop it?
