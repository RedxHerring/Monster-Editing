1
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:09,356
This is the most scandalous case
we've ever had

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,558
since the founding
of the Czech police.

3
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:14,969
The three men who were killed
were virtuous men,

4
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:18,062
but they were also affiliated with
the Czechoslovakian secret police!

5
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:22,971
I'd like to believe that their deaths
have rid the Prague station

6
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:25,308
of the last of
its dark connections.

7
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:30,048
You are proud officers
of the Czech force.

8
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:32,686
I expect conscientious behavior
from all of you.

9
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:41,588
Also, as the new head chief,
I must regain our citizens' trust.

10
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:46,566
I shall introduce the five members
of the special full-time investigative team

11
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:48,432
that was dispatched here
from headquarters.

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,229
I hope to cooperate with them

13
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:54,503
and close the book on this atrocious
case as soon as possible.

14
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:58,209
You're Detective Suk, right?

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,306
Yes.

16
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:05,575
As the new head chief, I'd like to
thank you for your investigation.

17
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:07,480
T-Thank you very much.

18
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,284
By the way, which case are
you in charge of right now?

19
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:13,622
The case that Inspector Zeman
was investigating.

20
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:17,692
The murder of Pedrov, a man who
was running an illegal orphanage.

21
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:22,163
I see. Concentrate on
your investigation.

22
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:24,496
Yes. Excuse me.

23
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:27,134
Oh. One more thing.

24
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:32,275
The tall man who has surfaced
as Inspector Zeman's killer...

25
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:36,545
Do you know anything about him?

26
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:41,754
No. I don't know anything
about the suspect.

27
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,856
All right. You may leave.

28
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:48,989
Excuse me.

29
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:01,439
Jan Suk...

30
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:04,644
It's been a year since
he was assigned here.

31
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:08,575
He was close with Inspector Zeman
from the beginning.

32
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:13,447
He revealed the hidden pasts of
Detective Patella and Detective Janacek,

33
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:16,388
and talked to Chief Hamrik
right before he died.

34
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:20,520
Keep an eye on him!

35
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:21,655
Yes, sir.

36
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:15,235
Hi.

37
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:21,341
I was really glad when
you answered the phone

38
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:24,476
when I called the place
you said you were staying at.

39
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:29,257
Did you think that you
would be betrayed again?

40
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:30,550
Well...

41
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:34,795
Orange juice.

42
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:43,997
You chose a crowded meeting place,
Mr. Grimmer. Will you be all right?

43
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:45,796
All right?

44
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:50,876
The new head chief still thinks
that you killed Inspector Zeman.

45
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:55,516
Also, aren't the former Czechoslovakian
secret police also after you?

46
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:01,047
Oh. Could it be that a crowded place
is actually safer?

47
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,353
There's no such thing
as a safe place.

48
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:04,517
Huh?

49
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:08,318
If they're coming after me, they'll do it
at any time and at any place.

50
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:12,890
For example... They could do it from
that window with the red curtains.

51
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:29,315
Mr. Grimmer, who exactly are you?

52
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:31,685
I'm just an unsuccessful journalist.

53
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:34,946
Oh. Then why is this
happening to you?

54
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,886
I just got in a little too deep.

55
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:39,960
This isn't funny!

56
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,096
Your life is in danger.

57
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:45,422
No, it's all right.

58
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:49,632
I wanted to do this.

59
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:57,168
Suk is currently at a café
in Republic Square.

60
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:04,450
He's meeting the tall man.
It's definitely Grimmer.

61
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,255
Okay. Should I let him
continue for a little longer?

62
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:15,219
So this happened because you
were gathering data on Pedrov,

63
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:19,392
who conducted brainwashing
experiments on children in East Germany?

64
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:20,660
Yeah.

65
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:27,364
Before he died, Pedrov entrusted you
with a safe deposit box key.

66
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:32,339
Yeah. He also said something
about "the monster's past."

67
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:34,713
"The monster's past"?

68
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:36,550
I don't know what that means,

69
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:39,780
but it seems like there are
a lot of people who want it.

70
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,755
The secret police?

71
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:46,060
And a blond woman.

72
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:52,262
The children from the orphanage also
told me that right after Pedrov was killed,

73
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,667
they saw a beautiful blond woman
leaving their house.

74
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:58,804
Do you know who
she might be?

75
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,088
I don't have a clue.

76
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:19,522
Are you all right?

77
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:20,453
Huh?

78
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:25,625
You haven't told your superiors that
you've been meeting me, have you?

79
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:28,929
Is it all right to
betray the police?

80
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,636
I'm not really hiding it
from them.

81
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:34,268
I've decided on
my own to do this.

82
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:38,306
I plan on reporting this to my superiors
once I have finished gathering evidence.

83
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,743
If I can investigate this thoroughly,
I can prove your innocence.

84
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,687
What's wrong?

85
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:49,452
Don't look to your left yet.

86
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:50,617
Huh?

87
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:54,951
The man to the left under
the parasol reading a newspaper...

88
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,556
He's suspicious.

89
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:05,639
Is it the secret police?

90
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:07,140
Who knows?

91
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:09,165
Now then...

92
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,436
Shall we go?

93
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,242
Go? Go where?

94
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,278
You brought the safe deposit box key
I entrusted you with, didn't you?

95
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:18,577
Yes.

96
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:24,024
Don't you want to know
the identity of the monster?

97
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,686
Yes.

98
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,029
Then let's go.

99
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:33,624
Though it might be
better not knowing.

100
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:38,867
You look pale.

101
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,047
That woman was
just in my sight.

102
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,157
What's wrong?

103
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:01,988
Nothing.

104
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:04,425
It was just my imagination.

105
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,793
Suk is on the move.

106
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:09,503
I'm going after him.

107
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:40,197
I'm Suk of the Prague police.
I called you earlier on the phone.

108
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:47,504
Please wait one moment.

109
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:11,255
Thank you for waiting.

110
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,127
This way. Come in.

111
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:29,612
Here are the safe deposit boxes.

112
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:53,937
Verify the contents
in that room.

113
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:00,645
A research paper
and a cassette tape...

114
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,482
I have a tape recorder.

115
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,288
Are you ready?
I'm going to play it.

116
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,500
<i>Where are you?</i>

117
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:30,500
<i>511 Kinderheim.</i>

118
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:32,879
A child's voice.

119
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:35,409
<i>What's your name?</i>

120
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:39,687
<i>My name is.. .Johan.</i>

121
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:52,266
<i>My name is.. .Johan.</i>

122
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,626
<i>What's your last name?</i>

123
00:11:57,471 --> 00:12:01,135
<i>I'll ask you once more.
What is your last name?</i>

124
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:05,104
<i>My name is Otto.</i>

125
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:13,683
<i>My name is Hans.
My name is Thomas.</i>

126
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:16,752
<i>My name is...</i>

127
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,453
<i>Which is your real name?</i>

128
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:26,094
<i>Once upon a time, in a land far away
there lived a nameless monster.</i>

129
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:32,795
<i>The monster was dying
to have a name.</i>

130
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,871
<i>Is that some sort of story?</i>

131
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,677
<i>I was waiting for Anna.</i>

132
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,911
<i>Who's Anna?</i>

133
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:45,180
<i>I read a picture book
while I waited for Anna.</i>

134
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:50,483
This boy was drugged
before he was questioned.

135
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:52,386
<i>Who's your father?</i>

136
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,227
<i>I don't know.</i>

137
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:55,829
<i>Who's your mother?</i>

138
00:12:56,697 --> 00:12:58,028
<i>I think she's alive.</i>

139
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:03,729
<i>You are a very brilliant child.
ls there anything you're afraid of?</i>

140
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,472
<i>What are you most afraid of?</i>

141
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:16,641
<i>Let me change the question.
Have you ever killed anyone?</i>

142
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:20,180
<i>Many people were dead.</i>

143
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:26,659
<i>It was as if Anna and I were
the only people in the world.</i>

144
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:28,456
<i>Where was that place ?</i>

145
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:36,704
<i>Let's go back.
What are you most afraid of?</i>

146
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:40,904
<i>The monster inside me
is getting bigger.</i>

147
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:46,210
<i>Munch-munch, chomp-chomp,
gobble-gobble gulp!</i>

148
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:51,178
<i>Munch-munch, chomp-chomp,
gobble-gobble gulp!</i>

149
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:55,851
<i>Munch-munch, chomp-chomp,
gobble-gobble gulp!</i>

150
00:13:56,924 --> 00:14:02,055
<i>The thing I'm
most afraid of.. .is...</i>

151
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:14,439
I feel sick.
I feel like throwing up.

152
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:18,545
Are you all right, Mr. Grimmer?

153
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:20,539
Yeah.

154
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:24,643
What is this tape?

155
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:29,748
Is this the identity of the monster?
I don't understand what it means.

156
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,462
Even if we don't understand it,

157
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,592
there are people who want it
more than anything in the world.

158
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,663
The Czechoslovakian secret police...

159
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,541
It doesn't matter whether we listen to it
halfway through or to the end.

160
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:52,512
There's already no turning back.

161
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:01,648
What should we do with that tape
and the research paper?

162
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:03,653
Should we leave it
in the safe deposit box?

163
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:08,487
No.

164
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:12,497
Under normal circumstances, we should
store it here as evidence, but...

165
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:15,493
You're going to hold on to it?

166
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,170
Then let's exit separately.

167
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:23,838
I'm the one they're after.

168
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:27,173
Oh yeah.

169
00:15:27,548 --> 00:15:31,883
Give me your cell phone number
and home address.

170
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:35,048
Let's contact each other
so that we know we're safe.

171
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:16,895
I got back home safely.

172
00:16:35,148 --> 00:16:36,912
I have a bad feeling.

173
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:40,377
He's just so hopeless.

174
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:43,948
A flat on Lanover Street...

175
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:52,531
What is the meaning of this?

176
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,261
That's what I want to ask you.

177
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,168
You know who we are, right?

178
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,707
The special investigations team
dispatched here from headquarters.

179
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:05,568
This is third-rank detective, Novak.

180
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:08,079
I'm third-rank detective, Zanda.

181
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,245
Why are the two of you
in my room?

182
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:14,051
How long have you
been meeting Grimmer?

183
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:16,785
Don't tell us that you don't know.

184
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:20,319
You two met at a café
in Republic Square

185
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:22,158
and went to
Prochazka Bank.

186
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:25,596
You know the man in
the picture, don't you?

187
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:26,792
Huh?

188
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,030
Captain Karel Lanke...

189
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:31,965
An important figure in
the Czechoslovakian secret police

190
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,473
who has gone underground.

191
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:36,875
I-I don't know that man.

192
00:17:37,978 --> 00:17:39,912
I checked your bank account.

193
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:43,082
This month you received
a large sum of money.

194
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:44,450
What is it for?

195
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:48,448
W-What are you talking about?!

196
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:50,147
I don't know about that money!

197
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:53,388
Right now, your mother
is being hospitalized

198
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,293
in Krumlov National Hospital
for a serious illness, isn't she?

199
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:02,697
It seems like it would cost quite a bit
just to pay for her hospital expenses.

200
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:06,737
What are you trying to say?

201
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:12,777
After separating from your father,
your mother raised you by herself.

202
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,715
You seem like you care
very much for your mother.

203
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:17,948
What are you trying to say?!

204
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:21,452
We want to check your room.

205
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:26,957
Go right ahead.

206
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:30,228
I haven't done anything wrong!

207
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:40,469
Go right ahead.

208
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:05,629
Zanda, come here.

209
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:26,744
What is this?

210
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:31,188
This was in your sink cabinet.

211
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:32,590
I don't know.

212
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:33,693
I know nothing about this.

213
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:38,087
I can't say what kind of drug this is
until we analyze it back at the station.

214
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,400
But in the bodies
of the three victims,

215
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:45,598
we found something with
muscle relaxant mixed into it.

216
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:49,543
They were Whiskey Bonbons.

217
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:55,337
Come back with us to the station
and tell us your story.

218
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:04,052
Fine.
Investigate me all you want.

219
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:06,059
All right.

220
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,627
Sorry.

221
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:12,463
Before we leave,
could I just change my shirt?

222
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:15,394
All right.

223
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:23,570
Calm down. Calm down.
I haven't done anything wrong.

224
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:26,679
They'll understand if
I explain things to them.

225
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:42,662
The smell of gunpowder?

226
00:22:02,742 --> 00:22:03,709
Suk!
