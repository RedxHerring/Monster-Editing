1
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:12,058
Where's the guest list
for the reception?

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,061
I've got it.

3
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:17,162
We have a pretty good understanding
of where all the guests were

4
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:18,501
during the incident.

5
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:21,870
Was the governor
the gunman's target?

6
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:25,578
All of the guests are VIPs.
Most of them probably have enemies.

7
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:27,974
Anyway, continue checking
for any connections

8
00:00:28,049 --> 00:00:29,312
the guests might have had
with the gunman.

9
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:32,744
The Frankfurt station
is in a state of chaos

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,255
over the convention center
shooting, isn't it?

11
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:36,647
Yes.

12
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:40,888
Even though we know who the culprit
is, we don't know who he was after.

13
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:44,260
Oh? You know
who the culprit is?

14
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:47,367
Yes. He's a dentist from
the redevelopment section of town.

15
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:50,868
A dentist, huh?
How terrible.

16
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:52,204
What's wrong?

17
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:56,506
Nothing... I was thinking of going
to a dentist after I retire.

18
00:00:57,211 --> 00:01:00,909
I've been busy every day,
so I haven't been able to go.

19
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:03,681
I don't want a crazy dentist.

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,378
Inspector, right this way.

21
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:08,147
Okay.

22
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:13,487
I'm Inspector Visbaugh

23
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,087
of the Nordrhein-Westfalen
police department.

24
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:48,745
Reinhart Dinger, age 42,
occupation, taxi driver...

25
00:02:49,424 --> 00:02:53,292
Suspected of killing a passenger
in Gunter Forest Park

26
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:57,992
as well as the '97 murder of
a Bilker Investment Bank employee,

27
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:04,831
the '96 Hofgarten murder,
the '95 Rhine Riverside murder...

28
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:08,775
Dinger is wanted for
all of these murders

29
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:10,709
which occurred near the
Düsseldorf metropolitan area.

30
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:13,707
Therefore,
I hereby request that

31
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:18,048
the suspect be moved to
the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen.

32
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,781
Hey. Are you ready?

33
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:21,947
Yes.

34
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:27,390
Get out.

35
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,196
All right. Shall we go?

36
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:41,408
Do you want
something to drink?

37
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:42,636
No.

38
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:48,782
Smoking's not allowed.

39
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:52,779
I said, "Smoking's prohibited
in this coach."

40
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:54,752
Huh? Yeah.

41
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:58,715
If only you lived the rest of
your life so morally...

42
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:03,497
How many people have
died at your hands?

43
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:13,033
Counting precious lives
on your fingers...

44
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:15,402
the ones you killed will
never be able to rest in peace.

45
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:31,215
This is my last job.
I'm retiring tomorrow.

46
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,725
It was a boring life as a detective,
but it wasn't bad.

47
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:40,495
Now I can live peacefully with
my wife and tend to my garden.

48
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:42,831
That's how life is.

49
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:48,865
I want you to regret destroying
the modest lives of others.

50
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:53,771
Even people who spit at me?

51
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,280
The passenger who I let off at
Adler Street spit at me as he got off.

52
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,817
You mean that you killed him
just for that?

53
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:08,862
Spitting at people is the most pathetic
thing you could do as a person,

54
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,193
don't you think?

55
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:17,227
The couple that got on at
Gerresheim Station were even worse.

56
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,570
They started having sex
in the back of my car.

57
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:23,304
In the back of my car!

58
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,947
So I killed them.

59
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:32,682
A young drunk with
a foul mouth...

60
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:37,222
A prostitute who tried to pay
the fare with her body...

61
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,561
An old hag with too much makeup who
kept insulting everyone around her...

62
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:45,061
All sorts of people
got into my taxi.

63
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:49,469
They were all scum.
So I killed them.

64
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:58,443
Then let me ask you
one more thing...

65
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,448
What about the murder of the
Bilker Investment Bank employee?

66
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,748
How was he scum?

67
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,851
He worked diligently, he had honest
relationships, he didn't even smoke.

68
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:12,253
That banker
loved his family.

69
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,860
Because you killed him,

70
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:18,297
a corporate bribery scandal
involving big-business conglomerates,

71
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:20,528
that he was going to blow
the whistle on, remains in the dark.

72
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:23,498
That...

73
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,705
left a bad aftertaste. Yeah.

74
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,307
Just look at that.

75
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,141
You talk proudly as if you are
delivering holy retribution,

76
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:34,545
but you're just trying to
justify your actions.

77
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:38,377
That one. .. I had no choice.

78
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:42,687
Did someone ask you
to kill him?

79
00:06:46,394 --> 00:06:48,294
I can't tell you that.

80
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:58,238
I told you,
"Smoking is prohibited."

81
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:07,806
Don't put a cigarette
in your mouth again.

82
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:09,477
If you do,
I'll kill you.

83
00:07:11,585 --> 00:07:15,249
I wonder what
made you like this.

84
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,987
I always have been right.
But I just got a little push.

85
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:26,430
On that day...

86
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:30,001
There was a man walking his dog.

87
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:35,606
<i>The man kicked the dog
for just for taking a crap.</i>

88
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:41,273
<i>The dog was terrified.
All it did was take a crap.</i>

89
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:43,680
<i>I stopped the man.</i>

90
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:03,031
<i>Before I realized what happened,
I was being subdued by the police.</i>

91
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:12,544
<i>That's when a boy appeared...</i>

92
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:17,282
And the boy told
the police officer,

93
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:23,888
"It's not his fault.
The man with the dog started it."

94
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:27,757
I wasn't arrested
because of that.

95
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:32,196
I thanked the boy and told him
that I'd give him a ride home.

96
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,035
But he said that he didn't
have a home to return to.

97
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:39,363
Furthermore, he brought out
his sister from the bushes.

98
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:41,933
They were twins.

99
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:47,905
Well, I didn't have a choice,
so I took them to my apartment.

100
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:52,678
Strangely, when they took off their
coats, they were both in pajamas.

101
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:56,485
It was as if they had
escaped from a hospital.

102
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,693
Come to think of it, the boy's head
was wrapped in bandages.

103
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:05,594
That night, we watched
the news after dinner.

104
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,496
I complained to myself as I usually do
about how pathetic the world is.

105
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:15,239
How pathetic people are...

106
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,671
I said that the scum
should all die!

107
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:23,175
And what do you think
that boy told me?

108
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:26,276
He said that I was right.

109
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:31,014
He then told me...

110
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,424
<i>We don't need people like that.</i>

111
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,301
That was when I was liberated.

112
00:09:43,537 --> 00:09:47,906
Cut it out! Are you saying that's
when you started killing people?

113
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,854
Good work, Inspector.

114
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:01,647
Yeah.

115
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,982
Your last job went off
without a hitch.

116
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,053
Yeah. I just have to
clean out my desk.

117
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:11,290
Thank you very much for
your long years of service.

118
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,562
I'm kind of relieved.

119
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:17,834
Well, there are some
cold cases, but...

120
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:25,604
What's wrong, Inspector?

121
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,081
<i>He brought his sister.
They were twins.</i>

122
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,449
<i>They were both in pajamas.</i>

123
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:42,287
<i>It was as if they had
escaped from a hospital.</i>

124
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:47,496
<i>Can you remember anything
about that night?</i>

125
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:51,868
<i>Anything will be fine.
Anything you can remember will do.</i>

126
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:54,802
<i>Your name is Anna.</i>

127
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:57,908
<i>Anna Liebert. isn't that right?</i>

128
00:10:58,846 --> 00:11:02,180
<i>Come to think of it, the boy's head
was wrapped in bandages.</i>

129
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,880
<i>The twins are
nowhere to be found!</i>

130
00:11:11,392 --> 00:11:12,621
Oh. Detective?

131
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:17,856
Huh? When did I meet those kids?

132
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,262
Well...

133
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:23,099
It was about 11 years ago.

134
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:27,299
W-What did those
children look like?

135
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:32,410
Well, they were blond twins
with beautiful faces.

136
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,676
I'll be damned...

137
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,454
Those twins
that disappeared...

138
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:50,626
The twins who are central to
solving Doctor Tenma's case.

139
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:54,424
This is frustrating.

140
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:01,164
Just thirty hours until
my retirement...

141
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:07,710
A vampire, huh?

142
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:11,580
I see. So that's why you
killed thirteen people.

143
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,551
You can't live without
drinking people's blood.

144
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,182
And they have to
be from virgins.

145
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:21,194
I see. I want to ask you
one more thing.

146
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:23,697
The murder three months ago...

147
00:12:23,864 --> 00:12:27,892
The daughter of a grocer in Frankfurt...
Frieder Schelling.

148
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:30,496
Did you drink her blood too?

149
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:34,401
No, you did indeed.

150
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:38,605
As you've said,
your victims until now were all girls.

151
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:43,640
Furthermore, you thoroughly researched
them before carrying out your attacks.

152
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:48,550
I understand how much
you need virgin blood.

153
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,355
But. ..Frieder Schelling...

154
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,955
was twenty-one.

155
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:57,790
Although she looked as if
she was still in her teens.

156
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:00,467
But that's not the issue here.

157
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:06,670
She had worked at a cafe on Zeiler
Street in Frankfurt since she was 16.

158
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:10,833
The cafe was next to
a prestigious gymnasium.

159
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:15,374
She was an idol to the boys
who attended that gymnasium.

160
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,742
But she had a child
when she was 17.

161
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:26,287
According to rumors, the father was
one of the students from that gymnasium.

162
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:30,653
After she gave birth,
her parents opened a grocery store.

163
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:33,933
The parents of the student
who got her pregnant were rich.

164
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,436
And rumor has it that her parents
received a lot of money from them

165
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:37,993
to open the store.

166
00:13:39,206 --> 00:13:40,674
You knew about that, didn't you?

167
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,872
After all, you researched
those other girls so thoroughly.

168
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,512
Do you drink blood even if
it's not from a virgin?

169
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,945
That one...
left a bad aftertaste.

170
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:57,850
Why did you go after her?

171
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:04,031
I met the real thing.

172
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:05,794
The "real thing"?

173
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,629
I knew it when I met him.

174
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:13,830
I knew that I was still just a bat
that just flies around vampires.

175
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:18,141
He is none other than
the real thing.

176
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:22,372
Did that man tell you to do it?
Who is he?

177
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:24,142
Where did you meet?

178
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:28,252
In a Frankfurt suburb...
Griesheim...

179
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:31,723
There's a park there
that's just like any other.

180
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,421
<i>At a sandbox in that park, he wrote
a woman's name with a tree branch.</i>

181
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:43,960
And I got to work.

182
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:46,202
Who is he?

183
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:50,472
I told you. A real vampire.

184
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,044
It's strange no matter
how you think of it, isn't it?

185
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:58,986
The murder of Erich Klemperer
four months ago...

186
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,047
You were only receiving orders
in Lower Saxony.

187
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,751
So why did you go to Frankfurt
just for this man?

188
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:10,427
Did the aliens communicate
this to you as well?

189
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,832
Did the aliens suddenly
change their minds

190
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:19,203
and tell you to go to
Frankfurt to kill someone?

191
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,101
Or was there
a different reason?

192
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:27,509
Mr. Klemperer history
is pretty suspicious.

193
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:31,578
He defected from East Berlin
during the Cold War.

194
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,596
During the past few years,

195
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,146
his food commerce business
seems to have done well.

196
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:39,292
But there are rumors that

197
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:42,329
he helped smuggle children
from the East to the West.

198
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:45,228
In other words,

199
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,964
he sold children from the East to
wealthy childless people on the West.

200
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:54,701
I wasn't contacted.
I met him in person.

201
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:01,780
I was really excited.
I was standing before a real alien.

202
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:05,448
Where did he land his UFO?

203
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:08,153
At a park in Griesheim.

204
00:16:09,723 --> 00:16:12,215
He spoke the language of the
cosmos.

205
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:17,593
So to make it easy for me to understand,
he wrote letters in the sandbox.

206
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:26,662
I wish you could feel
that excitement I felt then.

207
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:37,374
Good work,
Inspector Visbaugh.

208
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:38,483
Yeah.

209
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:42,049
You're finally counting down the
seconds until retirement, aren't you?

210
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,524
You're thinking of this as getting rid
of a nuisance, don't you?

211
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:46,883
That's right!

212
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:52,831
So today, we're celebrating the
riddance of a nuisance over drinks!

213
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,832
I get the feeling the alcohol
is going to taste bad.

214
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:01,899
Who's that man?

215
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:03,008
Oh...

216
00:17:03,176 --> 00:17:06,168
It's Dr. Gillen.
A criminal psychologist.

217
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:11,778
It seems he's come to see Dinger,
the serial killer taxi driver.

218
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:13,384
Who asked him to?

219
00:17:13,587 --> 00:17:16,750
Well... He said it was for
a paper or something.

220
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:19,253
He's an authority in his field,

221
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:21,488
so it seems he has connections
with important people.

222
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:33,773
When the passenger got out of the taxi
and spit at you, you ran him over.

223
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:35,040
Yeah.

224
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,001
I've said this over and over again
during interrogations,

225
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:42,072
but the people I killed
were all unneeded.

226
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:48,252
You just don't understand
how right I am.

227
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:52,790
"How right you are"' huh?
Then can I ask you one thing?

228
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:55,662
You're always talkative
during interrogations.

229
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,062
But when it comes to talking about
Mr. Oberth of Bilker Investment Bank,

230
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,124
you don't seem as forthcoming.

231
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,665
With the other murders,

232
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:08,368
it's been recorded that you express
your reasons for them.

233
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:16,071
But with the murder of Mr. Oberth,
you've never given a single clear reason.

234
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:20,787
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

235
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:27,452
How was it, Dr. Gillen?

236
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:29,787
I'm Inspector Visbaugh.

237
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:35,292
Did Dinger say anything
of scientific interest?

238
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:40,371
No. Nothing outside of reports
until now.

239
00:18:40,974 --> 00:18:41,941
Now then...

240
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:50,039
Actually, there's something
I really want to ask that man.

241
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,048
I'm going to retire today.

242
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,452
I won't feel right unless
I ask him this.

243
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:02,955
What do you think of this from
an academic standpoint?

244
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:07,725
If there was
a monster-like child...

245
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:12,796
and he grew up and revisited a man
who took care of him as a child...

246
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:16,238
A "monster-like child"?

247
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,310
Well... It's an absurd story.

248
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:24,880
Tell me the story in detail.

249
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,284
What do the two of you want?

250
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:32,622
I said that I didn't want to talk
to that researcher there.

251
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:36,188
I'm still a detective.
Until the end of the day.

252
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:37,960
This is an interrogation.

253
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:42,492
About the story you told me yesterday,
the one about the twins.

254
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:46,270
You told me that
the boy liberated you.

255
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,375
Suppose that child grew up
and asked you to do something...

256
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,381
Would you do it?

257
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:08,090
Well. .. Who knows?

258
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:12,498
The murder of Fritz Oberth from
the Bilker Investment Bank.

259
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,400
Did you do it
at someone's request?

260
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:24,574
A diligent man. An honest man.
That's the kind of man Mr. Oberth was.

261
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:28,378
He's far from what
you would call scum.

262
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,180
He was trying to
expose a bribery scandal

263
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:33,185
involving a certain
financial conglomerate.

264
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,218
If you call him scum, it would wreck
the reasoning behind your crimes.

265
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:47,164
I wasn't asked.

266
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:54,332
He and I don't need words.

267
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:55,540
"He"?

268
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:59,812
That bank employee
was probably trash to him.

269
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:02,309
That's what I'll believe.

270
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:03,443
Why?

271
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:05,446
Because he's right.

272
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:08,382
Who is he?
Is he the twin you talked about?

273
00:21:08,622 --> 00:21:10,454
When and where
did you meet him?

274
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:15,317
In Griesheim.
At a park in that town.

275
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,598
<i>In a Frankfurt suburb...
Griesheim.</i>

276
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,601
<i>At a park in Griesheim.</i>

277
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:27,772
He wrote a name
in the sandbox...

278
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,574
He didn't say a word.

279
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,246
But I understood.

280
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:38,074
He wanted me to kill the man
whose name he had written.

281
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:42,352
We don't need words.
We understand.

282
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:46,723
That we don't need this guy!

283
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:52,123
What do you mean?

284
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:53,960
The three people
you interviewed

285
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,935
were asked by the same person
to commit murders?

286
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:01,239
He tried to make the three murders
lose their significance

287
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:04,633
by incorporating them into three
completely unrelated multiple homicides.

288
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,836
Lose their significance?

289
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,575
What do you mean?
Tell me in detail.

290
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:17,988
Tenma and Nina
have headed to Frankfurt.

291
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:21,226
Johan...

292
00:22:25,498 --> 00:22:27,159
He's planning something...

293
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:31,229
in Frankfurt.
