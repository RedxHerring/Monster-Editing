1
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,298
<i>June 19, my first meeting
with Franz Bonaparta.</i>

2
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:26,078
<i>RF-17-9.
He's a very quiet man.</i>

3
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>He behaved elegantly
and wore a suit.</i>

4
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,850
<i>In the afternoon, he gathered
the children for a book reading.</i>

5
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:44,857
Where do you want to go?

6
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:46,634
To the border.

7
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:47,527
Which border?

8
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:49,203
The Czech border.

9
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:50,263
Get in.

10
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:51,531
Thank you.

11
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:06,187
<i>In the afternoon, he gathered
the children for a book reading.</i>

12
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:08,753
<i>A very strange mansion...</i>

13
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:10,852
<i>Red Rose Mansion...</i>

14
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:13,827
<i>P-Brevnov W..</i>

15
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:16,125
<i>A steeple to the left...</i>

16
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:17,993
<i>A weather vane
to the right...</i>

17
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:20,760
<i>Human dignity...</i>

18
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:22,195
<i>Experiment...</i>

19
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:24,432
<i>Amazing experiments...</i>

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,803
<i>Deprivation of dignity...</i>

21
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:28,271
Where are you from?

22
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:28,969
Huh?

23
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:31,336
I said,
"What country are you from?"

24
00:01:31,913 --> 00:01:33,813
Oh. I'm Japanese.

25
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,348
I don't know if a Japanese man
would like this, but...

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,280
Eat this.
It's leftover from my lunch.

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,649
Thank you. But...

28
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:44,783
Eat.

29
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:47,318
You look like you're
going to collapse.

30
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:53,494
My wife has been nagging me
to go on a diet.

31
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,859
Then I won't hesitate.

32
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,533
Yeah. Eat, eat!

33
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:00,300
You won't be able to last
the long journey if you don't eat!

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,514
I've got to finish this journey.

35
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,577
What?!

36
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:47,873
You let him go?
You just let Tenma go?!

37
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:48,875
Yes.

38
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,179
Why didn't you stop him?!

39
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,153
You know that you can't stop him.

40
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:57,020
But...

41
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:00,254
Especially since Eva Heinemann
is now missing.

42
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:01,887
It's a race against the clock.

43
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,190
That's why Tenma escaped.

44
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,970
That lawyer called Baul

45
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:21,641
is probably the same man who
tried to kill me at my clinic.

46
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:27,050
He was planning to take my father's
notebook by getting close to me.

47
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:31,221
That notebook must be
pretty important.

48
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:33,119
Let's go.

49
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,087
Where?

50
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:36,464
The place where
Tenma is headed...

51
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:38,997
The Red Rose Mansion...

52
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,193
Where is it?

53
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:44,129
My father's notebook is filled
with unintelligible descriptions.

54
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:46,536
I don't think that part is code.

55
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:52,175
Red Rose Mansion,
P-Brevnov W...

56
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:56,043
"P" stands for "Prague"
and "W' means "west."

57
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,382
The Prague suburbs to
the west of Brevnov.

58
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:03,886
It's somewhere you can see a steeple to
the left and a weather vane to the right.

59
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:06,216
I see.

60
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:09,359
I hope that
there's a witness

61
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,764
who will get us closer to solving
this case at that mansion.

62
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:16,165
But at this point...

63
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,297
No.

64
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:18,064
Huh?

65
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:24,377
An entry in the notebook said that children
would gather for recitals in the afternoon.

66
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:27,814
Those children are
our witnesses, huh?

67
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,017
Mr. Vardemann...

68
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:36,188
I scolded you for
letting Tenma go,

69
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,989
but had I been in the same position,
I'd have done the same thing.

70
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,954
Let's go.

71
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:50,964
I was here.

72
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,139
I lived in this town.

73
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,471
And...

74
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:03,016
<i>Welcome home</i>

75
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,245
Are you all right, Nina?

76
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:10,950
Yeah.

77
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:12,559
I'm all right.

78
00:06:15,596 --> 00:06:17,963
I think that
you should give up.

79
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,365
You get lost
every time you try.

80
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:24,336
No. I'll remember.

81
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:28,365
My brother talked to me
at that time.

82
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:31,571
When he was taken from
the "Three Frogs"...

83
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,810
What he passed along the way
and where he was taken...

84
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,594
When he passed the station,

85
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:41,953
a streetcar ran along the riverside
as he watched the town to his left...

86
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:51,565
Turn right here.

87
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:52,622
<i>Don't...</i>

88
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:58,966
<i>Don't keep secrets from him.</i>

89
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:03,137
Turn right?

90
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:07,281
What's wrong?

91
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:11,276
N-Nothing.

92
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:19,019
What do you think?
Notice anything?

93
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,286
I don't know.

94
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:26,122
It's no good.

95
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:30,064
You won't be able to remember a
conversation from such a long time ago.

96
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:32,562
Nina!

97
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:08,764
A weather vane to the right...

98
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,687
A church steeple to the left...

99
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:22,889
Nina!

100
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:49,550
The Red Rose Mansion...

101
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,214
Is this it?

102
00:08:58,859 --> 00:08:59,849
I don't know.

103
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,892
But. ..I know this place.

104
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:19,012
"I'm afraid"...

105
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:33,551
What is that?

106
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:48,335
It looks like the door just
emerged out of the wall.

107
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:27,010
There's nothing in this room.

108
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:28,341
Huh?

109
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:33,042
Nina ! Nina ! Nina!

110
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:36,756
You demon!

111
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,694
You demon! You demon !
You demon!

112
00:10:48,903 --> 00:10:50,598
The demon is dead.

113
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,893
How do you feel?

114
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:28,969
Welcome back, Mr. Lipsky.

115
00:11:29,743 --> 00:11:31,040
Did you have an audience?

116
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:33,613
No. I was terrible, as usual.

117
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,811
But they're such
wonderful dolls.

118
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,954
The one I'm making right now
is even better.

119
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:47,388
I'd like to see it soon.

120
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:51,656
I'll show it to you
right after I finish it.

121
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:54,300
It's time to go to work.

122
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:56,036
The restaurant?

123
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:59,367
Yeah. I can't make enough
just on dolls.

124
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:03,542
I'm sorry for staying here
for so long.

125
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:05,938
No. It's all right.
Don't worry.

126
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:11,574
Mr. Lipsky,
I want to ask you something.

127
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,145
W-What is it?

128
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:19,382
Three months ago, you found me
unconscious and took me to the hospital.

129
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:20,887
Yeah.

130
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:23,829
Why were you
at that mansion?

131
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,064
<i>Nina! Nina!</i>

132
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:28,602
<i>Nina!</i>

133
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:32,903
<i>Answer me, Nina! Nina!</i>

134
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:35,141
<i>What happened?</i>

135
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:44,377
When I go to that mansion,
I get ideas for my stories.

136
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,352
How should I say this?
Umm...

137
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:52,359
But right now,
rather than that mansion...

138
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:57,993
No, that's all right.
Anyway, don't be shy.

139
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,860
You can stay here
as long as you like.

140
00:13:35,703 --> 00:13:36,329
Nina...

141
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:41,535
Can I come in?

142
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:45,635
Of course.
Should you be up?

143
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:49,077
It's okay. Amazing!

144
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,751
So this room is where
your dolls are born.

145
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,084
I don't have an audience,
though.

146
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:57,652
What's your play about?

147
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:02,154
It's the story of a demon.

148
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:06,255
What's wrong, Nina?

149
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,368
Nothing. Continue.

150
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:13,530
A demon sets out on a journey in search
of a dragon that will destroy the world.

151
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:15,532
On the way, he nearly dies.

152
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:22,648
But a boy who's passing by
saves his life.

153
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:29,055
When the boy realizes who he's
saved, he chases after the demon.

154
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,783
At the end of his journey,
he finds the demon.

155
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:37,189
And with a knife in his hand,
kills the demon.

156
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:42,831
I think it's interesting,
but it isn't popular at all.

157
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:46,197
Are you all right, Nina?

158
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:49,269
I think that I would do that.

159
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:50,069
Huh?

160
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,075
I would do that.

161
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:58,085
But I mustn't let him do that.

162
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,348
Nina?

163
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:01,845
A human would...

164
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,525
save that demon.

165
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:07,958
You think so?

166
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:12,088
I think that he'd like this story.

167
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:13,225
"He?"

168
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:14,791
This shelf...

169
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,535
They're all picture books.

170
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:23,604
Jakub Farobek. .. Klaus Poppe...
Emile Scherbe.

171
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:26,943
<i>The Nameless Monster...</i>

172
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:29,876
You know him?

173
00:15:32,085 --> 00:15:34,144
He wrote many picture books.

174
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:39,181
Jakub Farobek. .. Klaus Poppe...
Emile Scherbe...

175
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:42,920
They're all pseudonyms
for the same person.

176
00:15:44,364 --> 00:15:47,129
The person called
Franz Bonaparta.

177
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:50,537
Franz. ..Bonaparta.

178
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:57,173
<i>People can become
whatever they want to be.</i>

179
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:04,279
I wasn't a brilliant child,
so I was thrown out of the recitals.

180
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:06,453
Recitals?

181
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:12,117
He held recitals at
the Red Rose Mansion.

182
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:14,852
I was a student there.

183
00:16:16,597 --> 00:16:21,125
I knew what
he was trying to do.

184
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,268
"A deal. Let's make a deal"'
said the demon.

185
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:32,639
"No, never"' said the man
with the big eyes.

186
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:37,611
"Sure. Let's make a deal"'
said the man with the big mouth.

187
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:42,087
The man with the big mouth's yard
became a flower garden.

188
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:48,827
The man with the big eyes was
very hungry because he was very poor.

189
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,428
The man with the big mouth
had so much fun everyday.

190
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:58,432
He was very full from eating the fruit
harvested from his garden,

191
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:03,204
so he didn't realize that
his flower garden was withering.

192
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:07,510
The man with the big mouth
cried and cried

193
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:10,812
in the garden that
would never grow again.

194
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,548
"I shouldn't have made a deal
with that demon." he cried.

195
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:21,183
The big-eyed person
was dying of hunger.

196
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:26,492
As the tears fell,
he cried,

197
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,831
"I should have made
a deal with the demon"

198
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,630
"A deal. Let's make a deal."
the demon said.

199
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:39,106
Jakub Farobek's

200
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:43,176
Jakub Farobek's <i>The Man with the
Big Eyes, the Man with the Big Mouth.</i>

201
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:49,446
We'd gather every Friday
at 3 PM for the recital.

202
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:55,418
We'd gather around him and listen,
he'd read to us in a kind voice.

203
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:57,958
In a kind voice...

204
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:01,264
A very kind and gentle voice...

205
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,736
And once he was done
reading a story, he'd ask them...

206
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:13,403
"The meaning of this story. .."

207
00:18:14,414 --> 00:18:15,882
<i>You understand it don't you?</i>

208
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:19,783
I-I understand.

209
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:23,147
I also understood after
reading it several times.

210
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,428
Then he'd take the next book.

211
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:31,888
Klaus Poppe's
<i>The God of Peace.</i>

212
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,836
Let's read this one next.

213
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:46,035
It's as if I've come here
for the first time.

214
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:50,282
Though it's taken quite some time...

215
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,850
all my memories have come together.

216
00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:04,490
The God of Peace
was very busy.

217
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:08,327
He blew his trumpet every day. He
didn't have the time to look in the mirror.

218
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:12,668
The God of Peace's trumpet
made everyone happy.

219
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,032
The God of Peace was very busy.

220
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,807
He poured the mysterious water. He
didn't have the time to look in the mirror.

221
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,982
The mysterious water made
the mountains green,

222
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:26,986
made the fields grow,
and made fields of flowers.

223
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:30,481
The God of Peace was very busy.

224
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:34,626
He gave everyone names. He didn't
have the time to look in the mirror.

225
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,531
Your name is Otto.

226
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:39,695
Your name is Hans.

227
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:42,133
Your name is Thomas.

228
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:46,165
Your name is Johan.

229
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:51,009
In appreciation,
Johan gave the God a lovely hat.

230
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:54,307
The God was very happy.

231
00:19:55,315 --> 00:19:57,750
He wanted to see what
he looked like with the hat on

232
00:19:57,818 --> 00:20:00,082
and, for the first time,
he stood before a mirror.

233
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:06,250
But there was a demon
reflected in the mirror.

234
00:20:07,494 --> 00:20:11,988
The demon said,
"You are me and I am you."

235
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,567
"What should I do?"
said the god.

236
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:17,632
"No one can live in peace
with a demon here."

237
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:19,964
"What should I do?
What should I do?"

238
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:22,973
The troubled God...

239
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:26,104
Do you know
what he did next?

240
00:20:27,814 --> 00:20:29,009
I know.

241
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:33,884
Do you know?
Do you know what the God did?

242
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:39,292
I know.

243
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:43,358
We finally meet.

244
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:47,993
I'm back. Welcome home.

245
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:51,295
It's me, Mother.

246
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,703
Even you couldn't tell us apart,
could you, Mother?

247
00:20:57,978 --> 00:21:02,575
She is me and I am her.
You are me and I am you.

248
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:05,179
I understand everything.

249
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,753
Where we came from
and where we're going.

250
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:16,059
The weather's nice outside,
Mother.

251
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:33,109
Everything will be in flames.

252
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,537
I know.

253
00:21:58,772 --> 00:21:59,796
The God...

254
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:19,848
points a gun
to his forehead...

255
00:22:28,802 --> 00:22:29,860
Shoot me.
