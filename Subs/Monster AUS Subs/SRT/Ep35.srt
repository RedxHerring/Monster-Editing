1
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,400
Domo. I look forward
to working with you.

2
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,866
Oh, Domo. Likewise!

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,173
I'd like to play golf
with you sometime.

4
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,009
Well, if we do, don't be
too hard on me.

5
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:28,645
We look forward to
continuing business with you.

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,040
Oh, Domo.

7
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:31,378
Domo!

8
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:32,379
Domo!

9
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:35,686
Domo... Domo, huh?

10
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,488
What an incomprehensible bunch.

11
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:43,926
Oh, domo, domo.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

12
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:46,791
My business meeting ran a bit late.

13
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,767
I'm Iwai of the Kadofuku Corporation,
Munich branch.

14
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:55,299
I'm inspector Lunge of the BKA.

15
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:57,603
Pleased to meet you.

16
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,042
Domo.

17
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:05,977
"Domo" and a bow?
I'm flattered.

18
00:01:08,122 --> 00:01:09,089
One coffee.

19
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,088
Oh, and a refill as well.

20
00:01:12,293 --> 00:01:15,388
You wanted to meet Yamamoto...

21
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:18,464
Right now, he's gone to
the Czech Republic on business.

22
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:21,028
He's going to return tomorrow.

23
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:22,665
You seem busy.

24
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:27,372
Well, do you know about Schuwald,
the business tycoon?

25
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:30,768
He's come out of seclusion and
restarted his business activities.

26
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:33,070
All the businesses under his control

27
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:36,344
and their subsidiaries have
recently been reinvigorated.

28
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:40,647
We Japanese businessmen are
very busy with Mr. Schuwald.

29
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:44,549
<i>Why is he laughing?</i>

30
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:49,291
So, Yamamoto can't help you today.

31
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:55,033
But he and I are just as
close to Kenzo Tenma.

32
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:56,971
I see...

33
00:01:57,372 --> 00:02:01,741
I was surprised. I didn't think
he was still under investigation.

34
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:05,178
Yes. We still haven't solved the case.

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,184
I was surprised when I heard that
Tenma was a suspect.

36
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,689
You were surprised.
Was it that unexpected?

37
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:18,258
Very surprised. I never would have
thought him capable of murder.

38
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:30,333
Well, actually,
I never thought he would do that.

39
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:35,004
I went drinking with him twice
three years ago.

40
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:37,175
He wasn't a bad person.

41
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:42,006
He's not a bad person...
Does that mean he's a good person?

42
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:47,655
A good person... Or rather...
He didn't reveal himself freely.

43
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:51,889
Is someone who doesn't
reveal himself a good person?

44
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,954
Well, anyway, it just means
that he wasn't too unsociable.

45
00:04:33,194 --> 00:04:35,754
Japanese people don't
usually wear these.

46
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:39,732
Japanese people are
handy with chopsticks.

47
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:42,136
I am a Japanese person.

48
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:43,763
Domo.

49
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:46,374
I am a Japanese person.

50
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:53,238
I am a Japanese person.
I am...Tenma.

51
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,047
Yes?

52
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:03,479
<i>Oh. ..Dad?</i>

53
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:05,151
Hi.

54
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:06,653
<i>Are you doing well?</i>

55
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:08,757
Yes. I am.

56
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:12,299
<i>I called because I heard that
you were in Munich.</i>

57
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,859
<i>I'm living here now.</i>

58
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:20,764
<i>Actually Dad' my son was born.</i>

59
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,379
I see... Congratulations.

60
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:30,978
<i>A lot has happened' but...
I want you to see your grandson.</i>

61
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:32,678
<i>Will you come to see us?</i>

62
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:35,950
Of course.

63
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:38,557
<i>Is tomorrow all right?</i>

64
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:41,358
Yes. If it's after 6 P.M.

65
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,224
We'll met at...the Marian Platz.

66
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:49,633
Okay. All right.
See you then.

67
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:51,364
Domo.

68
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:52,632
<i>Huh?</i>

69
00:05:58,512 --> 00:05:59,138
Ah...

70
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,940
You're so skillful with chopsticks.

71
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:03,350
Really?

72
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:06,185
Of course, lately,
there have been a lot of foreigners

73
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:09,154
who are even better at using chopsticks
than Japanese people are.

74
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,488
So, Doctor Takahashi...

75
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:15,961
As a colleague,
what kind of person was Tenma?

76
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:19,157
What kind? Well...

77
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:26,031
He wasn't that unsociable.
Well, he was a bit indecisive.

78
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:27,975
But...

79
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:29,002
But?

80
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:32,344
When he held a scalpel,
he was like a different person.

81
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:39,786
He's been called a brilliant brain surgeon,
and that's not an exaggeration.

82
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:41,983
What about his parents?

83
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,123
He didn't like to talk
much about them.

84
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:49,625
But he said that his father and
his older brother were also doctors.

85
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:53,456
Well, he probably had no choice
but to become a doctor.

86
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:56,833
Come to think of it,

87
00:06:56,904 --> 00:07:01,899
he said that he hasn't gone back to Japan
since he became a doctor in Germany.

88
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,509
And his parents didn't come here
during that uproar.

89
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,780
They also didn't argue
for their son's innocence.

90
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:15,951
I suppose that means that
he has weak family ties.

91
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:29,597
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:32,335
Yamamoto contacted me.

93
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:40,041
He's arrived in Munich from Prague.
But he has to go make a deal.

94
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:42,980
He seems busy.

95
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:47,653
He's going to meet us afterwards
at the place we're going to.

96
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:48,781
Place?

97
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,821
Oh yeah! Would you like to come,
inspector Lunge?

98
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:59,792
This must be fate! We might also be
indebted to you in the future, so...

99
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:08,201
No, today, I...

100
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:14,344
<i>I suppose that means that
he has weak family ties.</i>

101
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:18,950
I...am Tenma.

102
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,546
Huh?

103
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,790
That sounds good.
Please allow me to accompany you.

104
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:46,770
<i>Farewell Pleiades...</i>

105
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:51,945
<i>I'm going...</i>

106
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:56,767
<i>Farewell Pleiades!</i>

107
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,520
Yea!

108
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,128
As I expected of you Iwai!

109
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:04,221
How about you, Inspector Lunge?

110
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:05,458
All right!

111
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:12,000
Whoa. My song's next!

112
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:16,267
That's great!

113
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:17,970
We've been waiting for this!

114
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:23,449
<i>A love letter from Canada!
- A love letter from Canada!</i>

115
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:28,478
<i>- What a fun trip it would be</i>
- That's great!

116
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:31,786
<i>- If you were with me...</i>
- Woo hoo!

117
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,520
<i>I am Tenma.</i>

118
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:36,960
<i>- A love letter from Canada!</i>
- I am Tenma.

119
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:40,798
<i>I cannot blend
into Japanese society.</i>

120
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:44,001
<i>I can't ask for help here.</i>

121
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:50,107
<i>I have no place to go home to.</i>

122
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:54,742
<i>I am... alone.</i>

123
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:02,081
Ah...

124
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,922
Domo, domo.
I'm sorry I'm late!

125
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:05,718
Oh.

126
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:07,261
We've been waiting for you,
Yamamoto!

127
00:10:09,563 --> 00:10:12,089
This is Inspector Lunge,
the one I told you about on the phone.

128
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,131
Oh, domo. I'm Yamamoto of
Kadofuku Corporations' Munich branch.

129
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:18,598
Domo.

130
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:23,239
How did your negotiations go with
Mr. Kocht in the Czech Republic?

131
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:25,611
Well... He's tough.

132
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,808
Oh, yeah. I found it!

133
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,050
"It"?

134
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:33,396
The thing that Schuwald's right-hand man
asked us to find.

135
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,945
You know, the blond boy!

136
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:36,954
Huh? You found it?

137
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,094
Right now, getting on
that secretary's good side

138
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:43,859
is the best way to close a deal
with Mr. Schuwald!

139
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,094
I searched countless
used bookstores in Prague,

140
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,036
and I finally found one!

141
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:53,801
Ah. So this is the picture book!

142
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,769
The cover's gone and it's worn.

143
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:59,440
But it'll look good
if we package it nicely.

144
00:11:00,714 --> 00:11:03,081
Excuse me. I'll have a beer!

145
00:11:03,484 --> 00:11:04,542
May I see that for a moment?

146
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:06,152
Oh, go right ahead.

147
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,326
It's in Czech.

148
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:15,523
Whoa. My song's next!

149
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,187
All right!
- All right!

150
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:18,789
That's great!
- We've been waiting for you!

151
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:21,158
He's going to show off
his singing talent!

152
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:23,094
That's great!

153
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,509
Inspector, what are you looking up
in that dictionary?

154
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:37,951
Czech.

155
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:38,985
Czech?

156
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,280
Does it have something to do
with your investigation?

157
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:44,514
No...not at all.

158
00:11:45,593 --> 00:11:48,995
I'm surprised you're looking up
something unrelated to your case.

159
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,493
It's a line in a picture book.
I liked the pictures.

160
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:55,459
I wanted to know what
its captions said.

161
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:57,668
The inspector with a picture book...

162
00:11:58,572 --> 00:11:59,869
That's unusual.

163
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,367
"Look at me! Look at me!"

164
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,046
"The monster inside me
has gotten this big."

165
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,957
I see...

166
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,785
Johan's finally controlling that tycoon.

167
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:28,228
I heard about Johan from you before.
He's a complete monster.

168
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,237
A monster, huh?

169
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:34,606
Yeah. I've done quite a few murders.

170
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:39,274
But he's become something that
I could only wish to become.

171
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:42,409
Johan's my hero.

172
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:47,352
I see. I have one more thing
I want to ask you.

173
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:48,648
What is it?

174
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:52,418
If you were Johan,
what would you do next?

175
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:53,660
Next?

176
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:56,322
It's obvious.

177
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:02,893
I would kill my current parents...
the Lieberts.

178
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,229
Mr. Liebert.

179
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,905
Mr. Liebert!

180
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:13,179
Why would you do that?

181
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,550
Why? Because I've
grown bored with them.

182
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:18,583
Mr. Liebert!
Mr. Liebert!

183
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,444
Mr. Liebert!

184
00:13:22,923 --> 00:13:24,049
Yes? Who are you?

185
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:33,833
A psychoanalyst?
What business do you have with us?

186
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,366
I have no intention of
giving a long introduction.

187
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:40,666
I want to ask you about
your adopted son Johan.

188
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:42,966
Johan...adopted?

189
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:47,544
What are you talking about?
He's our child...

190
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:53,746
It's no use playing dumb!
The grave of your real child is in Bruntal.

191
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:58,225
You used the fact that
the town office's records had burned

192
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:02,957
to reapply for a birth certificate
as if your child were still alive.

193
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,560
Who in the world are you?

194
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:09,626
I didn't come to threaten you.

195
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:11,831
I came to help you.

196
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,164
I want you to read this!

197
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,334
Huh?

198
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,943
This is a report about Johan.

199
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:20,143
About Johan?

200
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:23,649
Yes... A certain man investigated
and compiled it.

201
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:25,777
Oh...

202
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:33,089
This person...
He came to sell us insurance.

203
00:14:34,628 --> 00:14:37,359
That's former police detective
Richard Brown.

204
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:38,755
Former police detective?

205
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,625
He's...dead.

206
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:44,971
Now read.

207
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,336
It begins in 1986,

208
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:53,939
when a certain East German government
official sought refuge in West Germany.

209
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:56,173
Is he after money?

210
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:59,182
Money?
He's not interested in that.

211
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,090
Then why would he
stick around a tycoon?

212
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:06,894
You did it when you were a kid,
didn't you?

213
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:07,753
Did what?

214
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:15,997
You'd take a line of ants...
and play around with them...like this.

215
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:24,744
This can't be.

216
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:28,382
I can't believe something
so terrible.

217
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:30,517
This is silly.

218
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:33,750
I understand why you
don't want to believe it.

219
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:37,053
You lost your son
when he was young.

220
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:41,157
When you couldn't
have children afterwards,

221
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:44,289
a boy about
your son's age appeared.

222
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:47,162
Furthermore, he had money.

223
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:51,005
He gave you a wonderful house.

224
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:56,505
He gave you a beautiful yard.
And he gave you affection.

225
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,771
I understand why
you want to believe in him.

226
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:05,475
But what's written there is the truth!

227
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,547
Who is Johan?

228
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,215
Who in the world is he?

229
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:19,593
Johan is a good boy.

230
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,732
He's a kind boy.

231
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:24,566
He's smart.

232
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:26,164
And clever.

233
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:29,599
He's our reason for living.

234
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:34,510
Is that all?

235
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:38,477
You've been his parents
for nearly five years.

236
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:41,454
Is that all you can say?

237
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:45,215
You don't know anything about him.

238
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:48,457
Please help me.

239
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:51,763
Because of him, my friend,
Richard, is dead!

240
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:55,224
And right now,
a man called Tenma is...

241
00:16:56,703 --> 00:16:59,297
is about to do something
that cannot be undone.

242
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:02,842
Please help me!

243
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:12,048
No. Besides that...you'll become like
the middle-aged couples mentioned here...

244
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,955
Like Johan's foster parents...

245
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:17,690
You'll be killed.

246
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:23,762
Get out of here! Come with me!

247
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:50,288
The apple tree has borne small fruit.

248
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:54,952
Yes... Next year,
they'll be even bigger.

249
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:56,928
I'm looking forward to that.

250
00:17:57,598 --> 00:18:00,863
Yes... Me too.

251
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:05,171
He's going to be killed by
a Japanese man soon?

252
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:08,168
Is that what Johan told those kids?

253
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:11,272
Yes... What do you think about that?

254
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:16,042
I'll say this, he doesn't have
any wish to kill himself.

255
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,077
Then what does it mean?

256
00:18:18,418 --> 00:18:22,582
Who knows?
It's difficult to think like a hero.

257
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:23,990
But...

258
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:27,018
But I can say this.

259
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:32,459
Even if a nuclear war burned everything
to the ground, he'd still survive.

260
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:49,316
So there's nothing we can do...

261
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:54,549
All we've done was for naught.

262
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:57,689
We couldn't even save Richard.

263
00:18:58,792 --> 00:18:59,884
Dr. Reichwein...

264
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:03,426
We can't locate Dr. Tenma...

265
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:07,934
Or even stop him from killing Johan!

266
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:09,360
It's all in vain!

267
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,603
Dr. Reichwein,
let's calm down and think.

268
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,008
Sorry.

269
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,550
Playing with a line of ants...

270
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:29,183
Even ants...have souls.

271
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,955
Doctor, where are you going?

272
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:39,489
At this point, we've got to
take desperate measures.

273
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,626
Huh?

274
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:47,301
I'm going to talk directly
to that tycoon Schuwald.

275
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:52,444
Huh? Fifty more seats?

276
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:56,149
Yeah. We'll be packed!

277
00:19:56,817 --> 00:20:00,151
For Mr. Schuwald's
book donation ceremony tomorrow?

278
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,723
Yes. Lots of big names
will be attending.

279
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:09,158
When Mr. Schuwald does something,
it's big news, even now!

280
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:20,301
<i>The library will soon be closing.</i>

281
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:23,971
<i>The library will soon be closing.</i>

282
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:51,170
Umm...

283
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:56,701
Excuse me,
could you get that for me?

284
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:57,503
Huh?

285
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:00,179
That Czech dictionary.

286
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:01,676
I can't reach it.

287
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:05,150
O-Oh, is this it?

288
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:10,847
Sorry. Thank you.

289
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:11,783
No problem.

290
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:15,619
I borrowed a Czech picture book,
but I didn't know what it says.

291
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:17,455
Oh, I see.

292
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:23,534
My friend suddenly collapsed
when he read this book.

293
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,496
Oh...

294
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:29,033
I thought that maybe the contents of
this book had something to do with it.

295
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:32,736
Did your friend get better?

296
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:36,105
Yes. Completely.
Thank you very much.

297
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:37,075
No problem.

298
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:49,086
Umm...

299
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:52,598
"Once upon a time,
in a land far away..."

300
00:21:57,337 --> 00:22:00,932
"There lived a nameless monster."

301
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:08,248
"The monster was
dying to have a name."

302
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,482
"So the monster set out
on a journey."

303
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:18,951
What an odd book.

304
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:21,490
We're closed!

305
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:22,387
Okay.

306
00:22:23,763 --> 00:22:25,993
We're closed tomorrow
for the ceremony.
