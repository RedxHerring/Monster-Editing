1
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:24,638
What's this?

2
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:25,572
What's going on?

3
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:27,340
It's over there, too!

4
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:28,074
Is it a short?!

5
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,476
It's a fire!

6
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,317
Get me a fire extinguisher.
Quickly!

7
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:55,105
What's the meaning of this?!

8
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:58,103
It's my job to shoot Schuwald!

9
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,877
What's with this fire?

10
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,815
I see! You changed your mind,
didn't you, Johan? This is better!

11
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,290
Much better!

12
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:13,787
They're like ants.

13
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:16,831
Everyone is running away
from the fire like ants!

14
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:23,227
Amazing! You're amazing, Johan!

15
00:01:23,304 --> 00:01:24,328
You're amazing!

16
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:39,487
Come and watch.

17
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:55,160
The books...
The books are burning!

18
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:03,277
Everyone is running
all over the place

19
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:05,335
without a thought for anyone else
and they are piling up on one another.

20
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:10,874
Can you feel it?

21
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:12,781
This fear...

22
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,974
<i>Two paths will open up to you
depending on whether or not</i>

23
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:49,608
<i>you can shoot your first target.</i>

24
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:54,152
<i>That will determine if you'll
be able to use a gun or not.</i>

25
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,157
Have you been taught
how to shoot?

26
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,254
No.

27
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,027
So you have your
own shooting style?

28
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:04,023
No.

29
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:06,525
I've never shot a gun before.

30
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:09,226
Not even once?

31
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:10,497
That's right.

32
00:04:13,407 --> 00:04:15,068
<i>Be sure to pull the trigger twice!</i>

33
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:19,006
<i>Your chances of finishing the job
rise drastically!</i>

34
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,810
<i>If you can't do that...</i>

35
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:25,678
<i>don't expect to live!</i>

36
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:36,663
I have to shoot him.

37
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,732
You can't do it.

38
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:42,136
I have to shoot him.

39
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:44,727
You can't do it.

40
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,165
I have to shoot him.

41
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:48,440
You're just a doctor.

42
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:53,606
You can only give life.

43
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,975
Taking lives is my job.

44
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,552
You can't do it.

45
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:24,878
<i>Be sure to pull the trigger twice.</i>

46
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,989
I didn't get hit anywhere.

47
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:19,131
My trembling has stopped...

48
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:21,735
Johan...

49
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,384
The smoke's in the way.

50
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:43,289
Quick...I've got to hurry.

51
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,194
I'm not letting him get away!
I'm not...

52
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:18,355
D-Don't push.

53
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:20,192
Help us!

54
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:23,726
This side is no good.

55
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:33,037
Open up. Open up.

56
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,236
Please calm down!
Everyone, act calmly!

57
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:39,970
Follow the directions of
the security guards and get in line.

58
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:41,014
I-It's no good!

59
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:44,277
All the doors have been locked.

60
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,086
What?

61
00:07:47,388 --> 00:07:50,358
A-Anyway,
take Schuwald with you!

62
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:51,250
Yes, sir!

63
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:54,060
Have you found an escape route?

64
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:59,194
Where do you plan on taking
Mr. Schuwald in this sea of fire?

65
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,230
Break down the door!

66
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:04,964
Yes!
- Yes!

67
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:18,680
Many books are burning.
The flames are consuming everything.

68
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:22,049
Is this all you wanted to do?

69
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,357
Are you satisfied telling me
about this hellish scene

70
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:30,864
in the same way that
you read to me?!

71
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,733
Your goal...

72
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:37,069
Wasn't it to become me?

73
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:39,965
I gave that up.

74
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:44,911
Something else
popped into my head.

75
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:56,081
You're not afraid, are you?

76
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,659
Where did you come from?

77
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,589
Who are you?

78
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,038
Can you see me?

79
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:21,006
You can barely see,
but if I get this close to you...

80
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:31,788
What can you see in my eyes?

81
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:39,958
I was born in a village
straight out of a fairytale

82
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,227
Many people were dead.

83
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:50,009
I held hands with my other self
as I walked there.

84
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:58,276
It seemed like we were
the only two people in the world.

85
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:05,156
We didn't have a name.

86
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:47,657
Hey lady!

87
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:55,033
Y-You're...

88
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:59,904
Dieter...do you know
this young lady?

89
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:07,747
It's a fire.

90
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:33,707
<i>Karl.. .there are important documents
I want you to fetch.</i>

91
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:38,545
<i>Go fetch them from the mansion.
They're on the desk in my study</i>

92
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,886
This, huh?

93
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:04,304
Mom...

94
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:13,778
Th-This is...

95
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:18,852
<i>"investigative report concerning
the death of Margot Langer."</i>

96
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:21,090
<i>"Herflich Detective Services..."</i>

97
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:27,892
<i>"Margot Langer, whose
real name was Helenka Novakova' "</i>

98
00:12:27,968 --> 00:12:32,565
<i>"was born in Prague' Czechoslovakia
on August 12' 1955."</i>

99
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,441
<i>"In 1970' at the age 15' "</i>

100
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,945
<i>"she illegally entered what was then
called the Federal Republic of Germany."</i>

101
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:46,196
<i>"In Munich'
she became a high-class call girl' "</i>

102
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,450
<i>"with a clientele consisting mainly
of politicians and businessmen."</i>

103
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:54,084
<i>"Her name was a secret in high society
but she became famous."</i>

104
00:12:55,062 --> 00:13:01,468
<i>"Our client' Hans Georg Schuwald'
was one of her clients."</i>

105
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:07,468
Dad... You were still
investigating Mom...

106
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:13,236
<i>"At age 22'
she bore Mr. Schuwald's son."</i>

107
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:18,577
"That boy's name was...Karl."

108
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:21,788
<i>Listen' Karl.</i>

109
00:13:22,122 --> 00:13:23,783
<i>Listen well to what
your mother has to say!</i>

110
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,789
<i>Take this money and
ride the train at Platform 5.</i>

111
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:29,062
<i>What about you' Mom?</i>

112
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,897
<i>I told you that
I can't go with you.</i>

113
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:34,364
<i>I'll stay with you.</i>

114
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:35,061
<i>No!</i>

115
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:37,736
<i>You'll be put in the orphanage'
if you stay with me!</i>

116
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:40,735
<i>You'll be called a prostitute's child
if you stay here.</i>

117
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,234
<i>Now' quickly.</i>

118
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:46,142
<i>What about Dad?
- Huh?</i>

119
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:50,745
<i>She said that
he abandoned me.</i>

120
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:57,548
<i>You weren't abandoned!</i>

121
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:02,726
<i>I don't hate him.</i>

122
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:06,659
<i>Mom!</i>

123
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,101
<i>Mom!</i>

124
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:21,971
Her son was passed around
to many foster parents.

125
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:24,112
He had many experiences.

126
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:26,486
He even had some
wonderful foster parents.

127
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:31,652
But he was alone...
always alone.

128
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:35,557
I guess they wouldn't
put that anywhere.

129
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:42,125
<i>"Margot Langer became one of
Germany's most exclusive call girls."</i>

<i>"the president of an underground bank
right before her retirement."</i>

133
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,805
<i>"However, this has
not been confirmed."</i>

134
00:14:56,316 --> 00:15:00,253
<i>"Moreover, this underground bank
laundered money for"</i>

135
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,086
<i>"Germany's black-market companies
for five years from 1991."</i>

136

<i>"in the business of taking illegal funds
and turning them into legal funds."</i>

Their relationship is a mystery "</i>

141

<i>"On November 2' 1996' Margot Langer
was found dead on Heide Street."</i>

142
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:47,962
<i>"According to police files' her death
was the work of a phantom killer."</i>

143
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:50,670
<i>"The culprit has not
been prosecuted."</i>

144
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:53,299
Mom...

145
00:15:55,476 --> 00:16:00,539
<i>"Margot Langer sent a letter to
a friend three months before her death."</i>

<i>"We obtained the letter and have
attached a copy to this report."</i>

147
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:14,553
This is...
Mom's handwriting...

148
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:25,433
<i>"I have quit my job and am now
living a very peaceful life."</i>

149
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:32,244
<i>"In this peace' I think about my son'
whom I am separated from..."</i>

150
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:36,579
<i>"And the friend whom I crossed
the Czechoslovakian border with."</i>

151
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:42,455
<i>"My friend was caught at the border
and forced to return to Prague."</i>

happily somewhere..."</i>

158
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:16,647
<i>"That's what I believe."</i>

159
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:22,862
It's all right, Mom.

160
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,590
I'm no longer alone.

161
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:31,735
Dad wanted me to read this letter.

162
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,276
I finally understand what Mom meant
when she said that she didn't hate Dad.

163
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:43,909
It's all right, Mom. I'm...

164
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:51,414
This is terrible!

165
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,524
All the doors have been locked!

166
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:56,353
Dieter, did you contact
the fire station?!

167
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,222
I already did that!

168
00:17:58,699 --> 00:17:59,666
Crap!

169
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,667
What is the world's
going on in this library?!

170
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:16,977
Help us.
- Get us out!

171
00:18:30,797 --> 00:18:33,494
Get away from the door!

172
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:19,909
It's opened, it's opened!

173
00:19:22,215 --> 00:19:24,309
Don't rush. One at a time!
Slowly!

174
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:27,149
Form a line and get out
in an orderly fashion!

175
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:30,047
Women and the elderly first!

176
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:34,455
Thank you.
How can we ever thank you?

177
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:37,864
Two more shots...

178
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:40,458
Hey...wait!

179
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:42,001
Hey you!

180
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:29,808
Johan!

181
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:25,464
Don't!

182
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:28,965
Dr. Tenma, you must not shoot!

183
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:30,502
Nina!

184
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:35,181
D-Don't...Nina.

185
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:38,151
Don't!

186
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:48,824
Crap!

187
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:15,951
Don't shoot.
You mustn't shoot!

188
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:30,203
Nina!
