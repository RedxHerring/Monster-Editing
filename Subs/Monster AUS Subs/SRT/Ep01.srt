1
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,102
That was magnificent.

2
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,111
Yes.
He was as skillful as ever.

3
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,173
The cerebral aneurysm was
in a delicate location. It's amazing that

4
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,775
he was able to clip it off so quickly.
-Yeah.

5
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:55,020
That surgery was superb,
Herr Dr. Tenma.

6
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,432
I realized once more,

7
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,426
what a brilliant surgeon you are,
Kenzo Tenma.

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,325
No, I owe it all to you.
Thank you all for your help.

9
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,860
The sun's high in the sky already...

10
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,560
Yes. That surgery lasted
six hours straight...

11
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,265
You have no outpatients to see today,
so rest up.

12
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:24,684
Hm?

13
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:46,973
What about Dad?
What happened to Dad?

14
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,536
Come on. Wake up.

15
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,907
Wake up, Dr. Tenma.

16
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,548
Our roles are reversed.

17
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:14,353
A princess like me
should be the one waking up to a kiss.

18
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,648
Eva... You're here...

19
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,160
You forgot about our date,

20
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,729
didn't you, Kenzo?
<i>-I'm here in Düsseldorf...</i>

21
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,757
Huh?
<i>-Liebert, the consultant to</i>

22
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,876
No, I didn't.
<i>-the East German Trade Commission,</i>

23
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,926
<i>who fled to the West
from East Germany</i>

24
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,871
<i>appeared before the press
along with his family yesterday</i>

25
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:38,588
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Liebert appeared to be
in good spirits,</i>

26
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,446
<i>along with their fraternal twins.</i>

27
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:47,597
<i>The family will remain in Düsseldorf
for a period of time</i>

28
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,386
<i>before moving to a home
prepared by authorities here.</i>

29
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,885
I feel like I haven't slept a wink.
<i>-In other news...</i>

30
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:55,885
Hey!

31
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,707
No, wake up!
<i>-Opera singer Rosenbauch...</i>

32
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,008
The news is about you.
<i>-who suffered</i>

33
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,898
<i>a subarachnoid hemorrhage yesterday
and was reported in critical condition...</i>

34
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,430
<i>seems to be recovering well
after undergoing surgery.</i>

35
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,130
<i>Dr. Heinemann, Director of
Eisler Memorial Hospital,</i>

36
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:10,540
<i>where the surgery was performed,
just held a press conference.</i>

37
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,213
<i>Mr. Rosenbauch suffered
a subarachnoid hemorrhage</i>

38
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,612
<i>stemming from a cerebral aneurysm.</i>

39
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,145
<i>The surgery went as expected,
and the clipping procedure</i>

40
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,348
<i>also went very well.</i>

41
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,357
<i>Mr. Rosenbauch has
quite a large following.</i>

42
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:26,951
<i>What are his chances
of a full recovery?</i>

43
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:32,125
<i>Yes, well, we will do our best
to assure he will sing again.</i>

44
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,461
<i>Dr. Heinemann's surgical team
has successfully completed</i>

45
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,334
<i>many difficult surgeries.</i>

46
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,141
<i>With this success, they have surely
solidified their position</i>

47
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,177
<i>in our country's medical community.</i>

48
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,946
That was wonderful, Kenzo.

49
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:50,479
That wasn't news about me;
it was about your father.

50
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,147
That's true...

51
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,386
But that's because you did
such a perfect job last night,

52
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,457
as part of Father's team.

53
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,982
I'm sure Father is grateful to you.

54
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,527
After all, you're the one
who has boosted

55
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,824
the reputation of the hospital.

56
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,226
I'm the one who is grateful.

57
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:11,234
It's thanks to your father that
I am able to work here in Germany.

58
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,431
Hang in there, Kenzo.

59
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,932
If you stick with Father,
your future is guaranteed.

60
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:17,911
It won't be long before

61
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,844
Father becomes
Chairman of the Board.

62
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,109
Then, you'll quickly become
Chief of Surgery,

63
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,742
and in time, the Chief Director...

64
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,321
And then, I will be the Director's wife!

65
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,958
You must make me happy, now.
Hardships do not suit me.

66
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,055
You want to go out on a date?
Or...

67
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,534
Blood pressure, 123 over 64.

68
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,143
Spatula...

69
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,875
I will now scrape the pyramis.

70
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:05,519
As always, you did a magnificent job,
Dr. Tenma.

71
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:06,916
Thank you.

72
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,620
Although...it seems you're
not just good in surgery.

73
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,332
Huh?

74
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:13,700
You've reached the position of
Head of neurosurgery

75
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,044
at such a young age,

76
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,446
and you're the favorite of

77
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,437
the Hospital Director
and the Chief of Surgery.

78
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:22,236
What's more, you've even captured
the heart of the Director's daughter.

79
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,446
W-What are you trying to say,
Dr. Becker?

80
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,741
Sorry. I'm not saying there's
anything wrong.

81
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,508
After all, a hospital is ruled by politics.

82
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,347
You do realize that you're being used
by the Director, don't you?

83
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,151
The surgery you performed
on that opera singer...

84
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,172
he acts like he performed it himself...

85
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,255
even holding a televised
press conference.

86
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:48,958
Well, if he's using you, it just means
that you are that capable.

87
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,534
If you become successful,
don't forget about me, now.

88
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,032
I'll treat you to a drink next time.

89
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,734
Uh... ls there something
you want to say?

90
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,533
You're Dr. Tenma?

91
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,804
Yes.

92
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,136
Bring me back my husband...

93
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,544
Bring my husband back to me!

94
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:37,008
You! Why didn't you operate
on my husband?!

95
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,151
Who are you?
-My husband was brought into

96
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,120
this hospital earlier!

97
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:48,256
He got here before that opera singer
Yet you made him wait!!

98
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,529
Huh?

99
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:54,858
You! They say you're the best surgeon
in this hospital! Why?

100
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,766
Why? Why?

101
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,801
<i>That day I was...</i>

102
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,673
<i>about to start surgery
on a Turkish man</i>

103
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,803
<i>injured in a construction site accident.</i>

104
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,205
<i>Dr. Tenma...</i>

105
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:09,716
<i>Yes?</i>

106
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,978
<i>You shouldn't be here.
Get over to OR 1, quickly.</i>

107
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,320
<i>It's an order from the Director.
Please hurry</i>

108
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,618
You... If you had operated on him,
he would have been saved!!

109
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,125
You...
-Mama...

110
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,428
Bring him back to me. Bring him back!

111
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,737
...and then my friend and I
fought over that dress.

112
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,841
They had only one in that size.

113
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,041
But don't worry.
It ended up in my hands.

114
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,518
Hey, are you listening?

115
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,719
Huh?

116
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,322
Oh...

117
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,125
What in the world is
the matter with you?

118
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,222
I looked at the patient's chart.

119
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,829
The surgeon who performed
the operation on the Turkish man

120
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,228
was Dr. Becker.

121
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,763
Oh, you're still stuck on that story?

122
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,066
Clearly, it took them too long
to begin treating that patient.

123
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:09,085
If I had performed surgery on him
I may have been able to

124
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,476
save that Turk.

125
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,878
Don't talk about this
while we're eating.

126
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,149
But, what would she have me do?

127
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,595
I was just following orders
from the Director

128
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,781
when I performed surgery
on that opera singer.

129
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,652
It wasn't my fault.

130
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,557
Isn't that right?

131
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,393
Of course.

132
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,561
After all, people's lives
aren't created equal.

133
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,700
Oh...

134
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,412
<i>Give him back!</i>

135
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,109
<i>Give my husband back to me!</i>

136
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,621
<i>...to me! ...to me!</i>

137
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:08,968
Is that the mansion?

138
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,934
Yes. It was reported by a neighbor.

139
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:14,969
How many shots?

140
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,376
Five or six.

141
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,973
Who lives here?

142
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:22,440
Well, uh... It seems to be
the residence of the Liebert family

143
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,348
who recently fled here
from East Germany.

144
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:28,177
Wha...? This is going to turn into
a big mess.

145
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:38,760
Charge in at the count of three!
1 , 2, 3!

146
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,753
This is bad...

147
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,256
What in the world...

148
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,364
S-Someone's there!

149
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,375
<i>There appears to be one survivor.
A girl!</i>

150
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,051
<i>A man and woman are dead!
A boy is in critical condition.</i>

151
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,280
<i>I repeat.
One boy is in critical condition!</i>

152
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,992
An emergency?

153
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,007
A shot to the head?

154
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,007
Is that boy the only patient?

155
00:12:57,411 --> 00:13:01,245
Yes. Both parents died instantly.
It seems to have been a robbery.

156
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:05,144
Got it. I'll be at the hospital
in five minutes.

157
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,060
<i>Oh, Father!</i>

158
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,862
I'm terribly sorry, Director Heinemann,

159
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,366
for keeping your precious daughter
out so late.

160
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,270
What are you talking about, Tenma.

161
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:30,567
Eva is your fiancé, isn't she?
How about coming in for some tea?

162
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,942
Have you notified
your parents in Japan

163
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,279
about your wedding date?

164
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:42,383
Uh-yes... But my father runs
a small clinic.

165
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,550
I'm not sure whether
he'll be able to spare the time

166
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,683
to come all the way here to Germany.

167
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,405
Wouldn't it be a good opportunity
for him to enjoy

168
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,295
a leisurely overseas trip?

169
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,460
That's right. They'll be coming
at our expense, after all.

170
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,897
Thank you very much.
I am completely indebted to you, sir.

171
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,652
When you arrived here in Germany,

172
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,735
I thought you were
a high school student, Kenzo.

173
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,115
And now you're the best
among the young doctors

174
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,651
at Eisler Memorial Hospital.

175
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,964
By the way, Kenzo...
That research you're doing

176
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:18,856
on cerebral vascular spasms
after subarachnoid hemorrhages...

177
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,652
Yes... I'm creating a model of
a subarachnoid hemorrhage in a dog.

178
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,727
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
cancel that research.

179
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,667
What?

180
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,638
I have been asked to speak
at the next

181
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,572
European Medical Convention.

182
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,737
I want to have you
compile my manuscript.

183
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:43,482
Oh, but...my research
is just about completed...

184
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:46,554
But, I tell you,
there was quite a scene today...

185
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,480
What happened, Father?

186
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:52,902
A suspicious group of people
forced their way into the hospital

187
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,088
and began clamoring about
that operation on

188
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,162
the opera singer the other day.

189
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:59,309
They claimed we delayed treatment
of an injured Turkish man

190
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,028
who had arrived earlier
than that singer.

191
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:08,138
They're completely wrong about that.
That Turk was operated on first.

192
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,345
There was nothing wrong
with our procedures.

193
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:16,649
Isn't that right?

194
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,619
Uh, yes...

195
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,164
Those guys have the mistaken idea

196
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,623
that doctors are volunteer workers,
or something.

197
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:28,822
We are scholars, first and foremost.
Isn't that right?

198
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,870
In any case, I want you to
work on my manuscript.

199
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,664
I have high expectations of you,
Tenma.

200
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:43,434
Uh, thank you very much...

201
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,295
Damn!

202
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,009
The patient?
-He was just wheeled in.

203
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,547
How is he?

204
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,447
Blood pressure, 72 over 50;
pulse 137.

205
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:26,444
The bullet went in
through his forehead...

206
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:28,949
Have X-rays done immediately.

207
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,156
Yes, sir!

208
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,652
Oh, Dr. Tenma!

209
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:39,966
Who's this girl?

210
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,161
She's that boy's twin sister.

211
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:43,880
Any injuries?

212
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:44,871
None.

213
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,474
But she seems to have sustained
serious psychological shock.

214
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:54,381
What is it?

215
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,677
Kill ...

216
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:03,923
Dr. Tenma!

217
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:08,220
The X-rays and CT scans
of his head are ready.

218
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,096
All right. I'll be right there.

219
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,692
It entered the front of the head...

220
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,895
and stopped deep in the brain.

221
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,337
Yes...

222
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,296
This is going to be difficult.

223
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:20,740
Huh?

224
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,007
The bullet is touching
the left middle cerebral artery.

225
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:30,641
I see. Dr. Tenma is right.
This is going to be very delicate.

226
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,563
If you move the bullet even a little,

227
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,147
the artery could rupture,
causing massive bleeding.

228
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:40,954
I'm sorry to be late.

229
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:43,026
Dr. Becker!

230
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:45,928
You're supposed to be on duty.
How could you be so late?!

231
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,625
We'll do a full frontal craniotomy
of the frontal region,

232
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:51,433
remove any bone fragments
and contaminated brain matter.

233
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,684
We'll then carefully remove the bullet

234
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,472
and finally repair
the damaged blood vessel.

235
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,811
It will take some time,
but let's do our best.

236
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:08,820
Blood pressure 120 over 30;
pulse 92. He looks good.

237
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,084
The anesthesia has kicked in.

238
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,434
Dr. Tenma...

239
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:22,936
Yes?

240
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,132
You should not be here.
You are needed at once in OR 1.

241
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:32,306
The mayor... Mayor Roddecker
has suffered a cerebral blood clot.

242
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,849
He's being transported here
by helicopter.

243
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,517
They're scheduled to arrive
in 10 minutes.

244
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:42,020
Then please contact Dr. Boyer.

245
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,551
There's a possibility of
arterial occlusion.

246
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,354
If that is the case,
you will perform the operation.

247
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:52,654
But I was just about to
begin surgery on that boy.

248
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:58,665
It's an order from the Director.

249
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,513
Yes? This is Tenma...

250
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,609
<i>Oh, is this Tenma?
Take care of the Mayor, will you?</i>

251
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,177
<i>I have contacted Dr. Eisen
and Dr. Boyer, too.</i>

252
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:15,989
<i>That should give us added insurance.</i>

253
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:20,215
But, Director Heinemann,
I am about to begin another operation.

254
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:23,093
<i>Let Dr. Becker handle that one.</i>

255
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,497
Huh?!

256
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:29,028
With all due respect,
the patient I am about to operate on

257
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:31,628
has a bullet up against
his left middle cerebral artery

258
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,638
and it could turn into
a very complex surgery!

259
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,809
But I am confident I can do it.

260
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,735
I'll let Dr. Boyer
take care of the Mayor.

261
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,408
Only I can perform
the necessary surgery on this boy!

262
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:46,512
Tenma... Whatever the case,
I want you to do all you can

263
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:47,952
to save the Mayor.

264
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:54,724
The Mayor has promised this hospital
a huge increase in subsidies

265
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:57,958
in the next review of medical facilities.

266
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,533
<i>We can't have him die just yet.</i>

267
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:07,272
So I want you to do this.
I'm counting on you, Tenma.

268
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,177
Yes...

269
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,782
The Mayor has arrived on the heliport.

270
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,784
After the CT scans are done,
do an angiogram.

271
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:23,490
Pinpoint the site of
the thrombus occlusion.

272
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,556
Get ready now, Dr. Tenma!

273
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,100
We're counting on
your genius abilities.

274
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:42,819
<i>Those guys have the mistaken idea
that doctors are</i>

275
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:44,572
<i>volunteer workers, or something.</i>

276
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:51,380
<i>We are scholars first and foremost
Isn't that right? Isn't that right...?</i>

277
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:52,685
<i>Isn't that right...?</i>

278
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,632
<i>I was just following orders
from the Director</i>

279
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,681
<i>when I performed surgery
on that opera singer.</i>

280
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,521
<i>It wasn't my fault.</i>

281
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,952
<i>Of course.</i>

282
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:04,354
<i>After all, people's lives
aren't created equal.</i>

283
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:10,066
<i>Give him back to me...</i>

284
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:13,669
<i>If you had operated on him,
he would have been saved.</i>

285
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,165
<i>Give my husband back to me!</i>

286
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:18,267
<i>Give him back! Give him back!
Give him back! Give him back!</i>

287
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,575
<i>Give him back! Give him back!
Give him back...!!</i>

288
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,378
What's the matter, Dr. Tenma?

289
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:37,994
I... I have a surgery to perform
in the other OR.

290
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:39,999
Huh...?

291
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,467
H-Hey, Dr. Tenma!

292
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:45,666
It's the Director's order!

293
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,404
The Mayor is undergoing
a CT scan now.

294
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,504
Doctors, you are needed immediately
in the reading room.

295
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:52,011
All right.

296
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,575
Wait, Dr. Tenma!

297
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:55,309
Dr. Tenma!!

298
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:09,924
Don't worry. Just hang in there!
I will save you!!

299
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,941
Kill...
