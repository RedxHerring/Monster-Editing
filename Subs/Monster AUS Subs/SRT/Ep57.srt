1
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:21,700
Shoot me.

2
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:27,439
Are you ready?
No need to be nervous.

3
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:31,074
Your hair clip is crooked.
I'll fix it.

4
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:35,446
Smile.

5
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:38,386
That's right.
You look very cute.

6
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:40,620
Now let's hold hands.

7
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,288
All right. Let's go.

8
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:59,472
Mr. Liebert who fled to
the West a few days ago

9
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:02,642
appeared before the press
with his wife and children.

10
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:05,849
Mr. and Mrs. Liebert
did not appear to be tired.

11
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:10,388
And their twin son and daughter
are both wearing bright expressions.

12
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:13,819
Mr. Liebert, what do you
think of West Germany?

13
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:16,320
It's very tough.

14
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:17,424
Huh?

15
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:23,271
When I realize that I'm free to say whatever
I want, I'm unable to find any words.

16
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:25,097
I see.

17
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,875
Anyway, the answer to that question is in
the smiling faces of my wife and children.

18
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:37,884
Your children also seem
to be enjoying their freedom.

19
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,083
Yes. So it seems.

20
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:44,620
Now then, would you care to talk
about the current situation in the East?

21
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:47,294
Big brother.
What are you doing?

22
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:49,286
Big brother...

23
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:55,830
Which hand is it in?

24
00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:59,705
Hmm... This one!

25
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:00,967
Correct.

26
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,135
Here. It's yours Anna.

27
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:06,740
Yay, an acorn!

28
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:09,840
Once more.
Which hand is it in?

29
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:12,476
Hmm... This one!

30
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,949
Correct again.
Here, it's yours again Anna.

31
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:17,692
Amazing!

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,156
Brother, open up
both of your hands.

33
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:27,826
What? Either one
would have been correct.

34
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:28,895
That's right.

35
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:33,335
All the acorns here
are yours anyway Anna.

36
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:44,777
Hey brother, did you see
the town on the way here?

37
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:47,147
It's completely different
from the other side.

38
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:49,381
There were lots
of pretty shops.

39
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:51,855
There were also
lots of clothes and toys.

40
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:54,351
You saw them too,
right, brother?

41
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:56,055
Yes. I saw it.

42
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,895
All that's yours too, Anna.

43
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:02,936
Really?

44
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:04,238
Really.

45
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,366
Why are they mine?

46
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:07,731
Everything is yours.

47
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:52,810
I saw you on TV, Mr. Liebert.

48
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:56,480
Anyway, just come in.

49
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:03,055
Brother... Is somebody here?

50
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:06,084
Brother...

51
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:08,485
Brother?

52
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,625
Brother?

53
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:23,770
Brother...

54
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,908
Brother... Did you do it?

55
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:35,006
All this time?

56
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:40,555
How Mr. Josef
and Mrs. Ciara died...

57
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:42,483
How Mr. Bedger died...

58
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,683
Did you do it all?

59
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:47,952
Today was special.

60
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:49,827
Did you do it brother?

61
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:54,463
Today. ..the monster came.

62
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:57,164
You killed all of them,
didn't you?!

63
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:00,572
The monster came
to take us away.

64
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:04,144
Hold out your hand.

65
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:14,645
Shoot me.

66
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:26,923
After you shoot me, wipe the gun with
a cloth and throw it out the window.

67
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:29,434
Be sure to shoot me
in the head.

68
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,100
After you shoot me,
run away.

69
00:07:32,773 --> 00:07:34,969
Run away so the monster
can't catch you.

70
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,973
It's all right. Even if I die,
you are me and I am you.

71
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:55,654
That night... That rainy night.. .
Someone came.

72
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,756
Nina?

73
00:07:57,198 --> 00:07:58,757
Someone came
to that mansion!

74
00:07:59,266 --> 00:07:59,892
Nina?!

75
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:02,865
Who?! Who came?! Who?!

76
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:06,231
<i>The monster came.</i>

77
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:10,803
Nina!

78
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,705
Nina!

79
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,949
This is pretty bad.

80
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:23,450
Why was the house on fire?

81
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,684
No one lived here.

82
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:27,623
They are saying it was arson.

83
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:29,487
How terrible.

84
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:31,522
Dr. Tenma...

85
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:36,526
Can you come with us
for a moment?

86
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,766
General Wolf
wants to see you.

87
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,908
General.. .Wolf?

88
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:04,854
General Wolf...

89
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:10,498
Doctor. ..Tenma...

90
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:11,431
Yes?

91
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,331
You were called upon too,
weren't you?

92
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:20,038
Johan wrote a letter to me saying that
he'd be waiting at the Red Rose Mansion.

93
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:25,585
But I was just barely able
to get to Prague hospital.

94
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:27,880
You've received
that letter, too?

95
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:29,987
How ironic.

96
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:34,726
Johan is now the only person who
sends letters to the man called Wolf.

97
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:39,696
You shouldn't talk too much.

98
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:43,403
I was born into a military family.

99
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:49,276
I was promised a life as one of the
chosen ones since the time I was born.

100
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:55,107
But now. .. The one who knows me
as I know myself is that monster.

101
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,647
I heard that the Red Rose Mansion
burned down.

102
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:05,421
They're probably revealing
themselves right about now.

103
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:09,424
Those whose names
were taken, like me.

104
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,427
Were you able to determine
where the fire started?

105
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:17,631
Yes. It seems it was a hall
on the second floor.

106
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,076
From the concentrated flames in that
area, it was probably kerosene or gasoline.

107
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:22,935
Kerosene?

108
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:24,836
I guess it was arson.

109
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:27,974
We can't be sure unless
we investigate carefully.

110
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:30,677
There are signs that a wall
in the hallway was broken down.

111
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:32,285
What does that mean?

112
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,180
Who knows?

113
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:34,254
U-Um...

114
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:36,149
C-Come here a moment!

115
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:37,049
What's wrong?

116
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:42,388
This is...

117
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:47,158
I dug it up when I saw something
at the base of the rose bush.

118
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,396
They just keep coming out.

119
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:56,137
They'll reveal themselves
after many years.

120
00:10:57,411 --> 00:11:02,178
But no one knows
their names any longer.

121
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,282
This is terrible.

122
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,045
It's completely burned down.

123
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:12,652
Our only clue to find Tenma.
At this rate...

124
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:13,921
Out of the way.
Let us through!

125
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:14,995
Out of the way!

126
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:19,091
What's this?

127
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:22,826
C-Contact headquarters!
This is an emergency!

128
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:25,499
Skeletons!
Tons of human remains!

129
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,265
46?

130
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,609
Yes. That's what I've heard.

131
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:38,676
In 1981 , 46 people suddenly
vanished in that mansion.

132
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,650
It was among the intelligence
I had received in East Germany.

133
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:47,592
They were doing an experiment
at that mansion.

134
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:49,796
An experiment...

135
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,323
Move back, move back.

136
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,227
This is my deduction.

137
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,790
Turn away any onlookers!

138
00:11:55,736 --> 00:12:00,401
Those children were
probably born there.

139
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:13,580
Brother... I'm cold.

140
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:18,322
I can't walk anymore.
I'm hungry.

141
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:28,492
Brother.. .
Are we going to die?

142
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:39,504
Brother... Say my name.
Say my name.

143
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:46,944
We have no names.

144
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:51,581
Say my name. My name...

145
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:09,235
Get a blanket.

146
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,136
Yes!

147
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,008
And some water to drink.

148
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:12,772
Yes!

149
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,432
"Because Johan was
such a wonderful name."

150
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,747
Johan...

151
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:51,383
Those children had no names.

152
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:59,085
When I gave that child the name
Johan, something awakened inside of him.

153
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:03,591
No. There's no point in
talking about the past.

154
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:06,331
Let's talk about the future.

155
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,528
Though, I no longer have
a tomorrow.

156
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:14,135
That's enough,
General Wolf.

157
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:15,575
Don't talk any more.

158
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,670
Eva Heinemann is...

159
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:24,084
Eva Heinemann is. ..
with people from my organization.

160
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:29,050
The four of us formed
our organization.

161
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,793
There's Professor Geidlitz,
who was killed, and me...

162
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:38,832
Eva.. .is with the other two.

163
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,661
He's trying to use Eva.

164
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:45,428
They mustn't come together.

165
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:51,807
Whether I live or not,
I can no longer stop it.

166
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:55,210
He's going to go wild.

167
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:58,975
Stop him. Save us, Tenma.

168
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,645
Doctor Tenma...

169
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:08,858
My name is Helmut...
Helmut Wolf.

170
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:16,634
There's no longer anyone
who knows me as Helmut.

171
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:22,205
Call me. ..by my name.
It's the proof of my existence.

172
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:23,669
Helmut...

173
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:25,240
My name...

174
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:29,081
Helmut.. .
You're Helmut Wolf!

175
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:35,155
So this is what Johan saw.

176
00:15:41,862 --> 00:15:44,524
A world without names...

177
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:51,362
General Wolf...

178
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:16,420
It burned down, huh?

179
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:22,064
The gate is locked.
The police probably made it off limits.

180
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:31,237
It's useless.

181
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:34,105
Mr. Lipsky...

182
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,211
I understand how important
this place was to you.

183
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:39,252
You went to the recitals here
when you were a child.

184
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:40,679
But...

185
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:44,758
Nina. .. It should have been
an important place for you as well.

186
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:49,590
This might have been the place that
could have brought back your memories.

187
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:53,289
That vision...

188
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:59,765
Many people piled up dead in
a large hall in this mansion.

189
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:05,408
The vision you had was true.
I was surprised when I saw the news.

190
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,638
They said that they found the remains
of 46 people at the Red Rose Mansion.

191
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:14,184
Was it as your brother...
as Johan said it was?

192
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:17,756
What did my brother. ..
Johan see?

193
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:20,353
Something terribly frightening?

194
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:22,522
True fear?

195
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,555
If I had been there at the time...

196
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:32,569
If I were there,
would I have become the monster?

197
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:37,434
Nina... It might have been a good
thing for this place to burn down.

198
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:41,003
I thought that it would
be more painful.

199
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:44,883
I thought that I couldn't live
if I lost this place.

200
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:48,351
But I just don't feel that way.

201
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,025
This place is just
full of sad memories.

202
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:55,725
I wasn't a superior pupil.

203
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:57,789
That was sad.

204
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:00,991
I couldn't meet his expectations.

205
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:03,265
That was sad.

206
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:09,032
If...If I had been able
to meet his expectations...

207
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:12,568
But that wasn't the case.

208
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:15,276
I became unwanted.

209
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:19,277
Mr. Lipsky what about
your mom and dad?

210
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:20,779
They are alive.

211
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:23,990
But.. .I've never lived with them.

212
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:26,451
Your memory...

213
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:32,057
If your memory comes back Nina,
I hope they are fun memories.

214
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,463
Fun memories?

215
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:37,130
Yes...fun memories.

216
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:43,838
I wonder what fun memories are?

217
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:45,771
Tenma told me...

218
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:50,048
If you don't have any fun memories,
you just have to make them.

219
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:55,354
Tenma said that we should
just start making them.

220
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:48,938
Dieter, you've got ketchup
around your mouth. It's all red.

221
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:49,976
You too, Nina!

222
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,936
Huh?

223
00:19:58,418 --> 00:19:59,078
Nina...

224
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:04,050
I'm making a new puppet play
right now.

225
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:05,719
What's it about?

226
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:09,886
No one's ever wanted
to watch my puppet plays.

227
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:14,094
But people might like this one.

228
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,533
Show me your new work!

229
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:17,870
I wanna see it!

230
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:25,244
I am a girl who's
lost her memory.

231
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:28,312
I had a dream that I was
being chased by a monster.

232
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:30,949
I had a dream that I was
chasing a monster.

233
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,546
But I like to sing.

234
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,457
I like to dance too.

235
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:41,354
Someday,
I'll have a wonderful dream.

236
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:44,323
Someday,
that dream will come true.

237
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,426
Someday...

238
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:53,099
I can't figure out
what comes next.

239
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:57,671
I'd like to make this girl's story
have a happy ending.

240
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:01,575
But I still can't think of one.

241
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:04,451
I'd like to make it
a happy ending.

242
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:07,380
I'd like to make it
a happy ending.

243
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:12,925
Thank you.

244
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:18,323
The girl made up her mind
to go on a journey.

245
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:21,892
She doesn't know what
kind of journey it will be.

246
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:25,938
She doesn't know what
is waiting for her.

247
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:32,639
But the girl will courageously
continue her journey.

248
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:38,142
The girl turns and waves her hand
again and again.

249
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:40,282
Again and again...

250
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:43,956
And she is gone.

251
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:53,259
To search for
a happy ending.

252
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:12,777
Nina!

253
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:13,745
Nina!

254
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:15,447
Nina, you've come b–

255
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:20,517
I've been looking for you,
Mr. Lipsky.

256
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:24,955
You're the owner of
the Red Rose Mansion...

257
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:28,331
Franz Bonaparta's son,
aren't you?
