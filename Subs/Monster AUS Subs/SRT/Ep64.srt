1
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:16,129
First came countless bouquets that
barely fit into my dressing room...

2
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:22,301
Next came the brand-name
clothes and bags...

3
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:28,381
Finally a jewel the size of which
I've never seen before...

4
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:33,947
I had no idea who was
sending them to me.

5
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:36,350
It was you.

6
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:41,151
I felt something special
when I first saw your show.

7
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:42,354
Something special?

8
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,789
Was it my chest or my ass?

9
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:47,527
Something that
cannot be seen.

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,435
You should have come to see me
in person in my dressing room.

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,869
Even someone like me?

12
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:56,039
Huh? What are you
talking about?

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,881
You seem like someone
who'll listen to my story.

14
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:39,937
This is delicious!
I've never had anything this delicious!

15
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:41,706
Eat all you want.

16
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:44,984
Does "The Baby"
always eat this good?

17
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:51,590
Yes. But it can be good or bad
depending on the company you're with.

18
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:55,057
I always eat by myself.

19
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:57,624
Do you eat with a group?

20
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:01,263
Yes. I pay many people
and bring them over.

21
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,665
Huh? Why do you do that?

22
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,502
I wonder why.

23
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,406
Now that I think of it,

24
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:11,571
no matter how many people I bring
and no matter how lively things are,

25
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:14,411
I always feel like
I'm eating by myself.

26
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:16,283
How about now?

27
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:19,245
It's very fun.

28
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,446
That's good!

29
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:24,324
Would you care to dine
with me from now on?

30
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:28,393
All right. But I'll get tired
if the food is always like this.

31
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,928
It's been odd lately.

32
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,268
What has?

33
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:38,167
I've never felt like this before.

34
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:44,239
I built my kingdom
here in Frankfurt.

35
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:48,482
I fought to establish
a new order.

36
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,278
It was my dream to become
like Der Führer, Hitler.

37
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:56,748
My dream is to
become a dancer.

38
00:03:57,592 --> 00:04:00,027
What I'm doing right now
is a little different.

39
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:03,361
But everyone's fascinated
when they watch me dance.

40
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:06,627
I feel kind of good
when I dance.

41
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,668
I'm afraid.

42
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:08,495
Huh?

43
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:13,107
This is the first time
I've ever felt this way.

44
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:16,835
I'm afraid.

45
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:21,846
What are you trying to say?

46
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,879
Oh... Well... Anyway...

47
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:28,183
About the three murders that have
occurred during the past few months...

48
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:30,318
It was probably Johan's will.

49
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:34,222
Y-Yes. It's as you say.

50
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:37,960
I understand the meaning of
the murder of Fritz Oberth,

51
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:40,160
the Bilker Investment
Bank employee,

52
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:43,169
and the murder of Frieda Schilling,
the grocer's daughter.

53
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:45,703
He was hiding a scandal.

54
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:49,702
I understood what
those murders were for.

55
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:54,681
But Erich Klemperer,
the trader...

56
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,284
Did you know him?

57
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:00,750
No, I didn't know about it.

58
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,751
It's unrelated to Johan.

59
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,420
Is that really so?

60
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:13,562
Do we really know what
Johan is trying to achieve?

61
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,406
Or are you hiding
something from me?

62
00:05:23,744 --> 00:05:28,875
You have no need to worry.
Anyway, were you able to find Nina?

63
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:33,553
She left a psychologist
in Munich,

64
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:35,555
and it seems that she's
headed to Frankfurt.

65
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:41,894
Don't you think our first priority
right now is capturing Nina?

66
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:50,333
I don't think you know Nina's true nature.
Don't forget that she's Johan's sister.

67
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:55,500
That look she had...

68
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,839
That time we tried to burn down
the Turkish district...

69
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:03,242
The look she had when
she pointed her gun at me...

70
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:06,048
It gives me chills
just thinking about it.

71
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:08,685
Why, that's splendid.

72
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,826
Does that come from
the program you set up?

73
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:18,398
I only helped.
My master did everything.

74
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:26,171
Everything is proceeding
according to his program.

75
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:41,987
Are things really going
according to the program?

76
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,648
There it is!

77
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,419
Over there ! It's my favorite

78
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:48,692
This time, I'm buying.

79
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,170
Is it good? This is the best
ice cream in Frankfurt.

80
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:06,603
Yes, it's been a long time
since I've felt relieved.

81
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:10,211
Lately, I've been on edge.

82
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:11,551
Why?

83
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:15,655
Yes. I wonder why.

84
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:19,319
There's no need to
guard me so heavily.

85
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:23,325
Still, those are
Mr. Čapek's orders.

86
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,699
There's no need to worry.

87
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:30,999
Even if I walk outside, there aren't
many people who know who I am.

88
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:37,336
No. Things will become troublesome if
we let you do whatever you want again.

89
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:40,473
Who did whatever
they wanted?

90
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:45,676
Three people died to
cover up your scandals.

91
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,659
I wonder how many people will have
to be killed before people figure it out.

92
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:57,655
Who do you think is responsible
for keeping you in your position?

93
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:02,396
The four leaders
of this organization...

94
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:09,808
Professor Geidlitz, General Wolf,
Mr. Čapek... And your late father...

95
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:14,512
You seem to think that you've
succeeded to your father's post...

96
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:16,243
but it's not that simple.

97
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:20,948
What matters is whether you are a
talented person who is worthy of that post.

98
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:27,692
Are you saying that you
should have had the post?

99
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:30,291
The scandals
surrounding you...

100
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:33,266
I know all of them.

101
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:38,165
You know what happens to people
who know about them, don't you?

102
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:48,544
You're ten years too early
to try to scare me.

103
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:52,077
I have no intentions of
making an enemy of you.

104
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,984
You're the great leader of
Frankfurt's right-wing group.

105
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,631
I had fun.

106
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:11,972
Me too.

107
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:15,174
I'm really glad that
I talked to you today.

108
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:17,404
Talk to me any time.

109
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,651
It's been a long time since I walked
the streets like this without bodyguards.

110
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:30,086
Are you all right?
Shall I walk you home?

111
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:33,425
You? Walk me home?

112
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:36,095
Are saying that you're
going to protect me?

113
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:42,060
I'll be all right.

114
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,234
My hotel's nearby.

115
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:47,100
Amazing! You live in a hotel.

116
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:49,268
Here. This isn't much, but...

117
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:50,603
I don't need any.

118
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:51,370
Huh?

119
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:54,981
Goodbye.

120
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:58,379
Oh. S-Sorry.

121
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:01,150
It's a habit of mine.
I apologize.

122
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:11,565
I always...

123
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,465
bought people with money...

124
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,307
Can I go...

125
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:29,883
up to your hotel room?

126
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,551
You're called "The Baby"...

127
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,687
But what's your real name?

128
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:44,631
My name is...

129
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:47,860
Yes.

130
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:50,734
We've located the twin sister.

131
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:55,437
I called the Baby right now,
but he's not answering...

132
00:10:57,678 --> 00:10:59,339
so I'm going directly to his room.

133
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:02,073
Yes... Later...

134
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:35,039
Hello? Yes. It's me.

135
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:36,932
<i>Th-The Baby...</i>

136
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:40,614
<i>The Baby...</i>

137
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,082
<i>He's been killed!</i>

138
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:03,930
<i>Come here.</i>

139
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:05,839
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

140
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:07,897
<i>There's nothing
to be afraid of.</i>

141
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:18,446
Are you all right? Mr. Čapek?
You look pale.

142
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:23,857
So... Forgive me for asking
such a rude question,

143
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:27,819
You weren't the one who
killed the Baby, were you?

144
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,421
What an absurd question.

145
00:13:30,264 --> 00:13:32,255
We're just asking you
to confirm that.

146
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:37,764
By dawn, news of the Baby's death
will have spread everywhere.

147
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,567
With the death of the Baby,

148
00:13:40,641 --> 00:13:43,770
the balance of this organization
might suddenly collapse.

149
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:47,179
Our situation from
here on is unclear.

150
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:52,476
We are bodyguards. We will carry out
the job we were assigned.

151
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:59,426
But if that was your work, guarding
you will no longer be in our interest.

152
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:03,659
Why do you think
I called you

153
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:07,031
immediately upon hearing
the news of the Baby's death?

154
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:11,169
Was it because you sensed that
you would be in danger next?

155
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,400
Do you have an idea of
who killed the Baby?

156
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:22,516
<i>Do we really know what
Johan is trying to achieve?</i>

157
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,448
What am I afraid of?

158
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:36,058
Everything is going
according to plan.

159
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,133
Everything is...

160
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:45,802
is proceeding according
to the program.

161
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:53,343
Fine then.
We'll move you to a safe location.

162
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:56,349
I have a mountain villa
in Idstein.

163
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:58,980
I haven't told
anyone about it.

164
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:04,453
We'll stay there for a while.
But first... The twin sister...

165
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:07,851
You said that you knew where
the twin sister was, didn't you?

166
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:11,127
Yes. She's come
here to Frankfurt.

167
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:13,797
She's staying at the Toulette,
a cheap hotel.

168
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:19,504
Securing this girl will
guarantee my safety for now.

169
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,539
We'll do it immediately
tomorrow morning.

170
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:23,643
Do it right now!

171
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:28,681
All right.

172
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,753
I've contacted two other guards
to head to your villa in Idstein.

173
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:42,888
Okay.

174
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:46,467
Last night, for some reason,
the Baby sent his bodyguards away.

175
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,797
He went out on his own
and got himself killed.

176
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,331
You have us.

177
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:53,096
Don't worry.

178
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:56,102
Okay.

179
00:15:57,144 --> 00:15:58,305
You were also safe when

180
00:15:58,378 --> 00:16:01,143
that man tried shooting you at
the convention center the other day.

181
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:03,716
You're very lucky.

182
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,083
<i>Milan...</i>

183
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:13,560
<i>Milan, listen.</i>

184
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:17,430
<i>I've met a wonderful man.</i>

185
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:23,862
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Peter Čapek.

186
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,241
You've shown me something
wonderful. Your "recitals."

187
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:34,209
Could you tell me
more about them?

188
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:36,911
About your new...

189
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:40,186
You should read this.

190
00:16:46,994 --> 00:16:49,361
All the answers are
in these books.

191
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:53,458
Oh, how beautiful.

192
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,869
What beautiful children.

193
00:16:57,538 --> 00:17:02,806
So these children are the ones who
will lead the future of the human race,

194
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:05,504
according to your program,
Franz Bonaparta.

195
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:24,957
The car...

196
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,267
Stop the car.

197
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:38,144
What's wrong?

198
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:41,738
We'll be at your mountain villa once
we go up this forest path up ahead.

199
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,375
What did you say earlier?

200
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:44,443
Huh?

201
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:46,650
Two more guards.

202
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,384
Yes. At your mountain villa.. .
They should have arrived by now.

203
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:56,420
Is there any chance that those two
could let any other information slip?

204
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,156
Huh?

205
00:17:57,731 --> 00:18:00,860
Can you assure me that they
haven't leaked the information

206
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:03,164
that I'm heading to
my mountain villa?

207
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:07,196
Yes.
They're trustworthy people.

208
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:09,200
I've decided not to go
to my mountain villa.

209
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:11,741
Huh? Hold on a second.

210
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,240
So where are you going?

211
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:17,940
Never mind that. I've decided that
I'm not going to my mountain villa.

212
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:24,181
But there's no point
in driving all night.

213
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,592
This is an order.

214
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,963
I know that you feel
threatened, but...

215
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:36,226
Let's just go to
your mountain villa.

216
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:09,569
A-A lighter?

217
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:14,768
H-He wasn't reaching
for his gun?

218
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:05,682
It's me. Is anybody here?

219
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:47,593
J-Johan...

220
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,564
At Red Rose Mansion...

221
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:58,104
many people drank that wine.

222
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:10,946
It's all right. See?
I'm drinking it too.

223
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:20,490
What happened to the bodyguards
who are supposed to be here?

224
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:30,005
Why...did you kill the Baby?

225
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,949
We're supposed to be allies!
Y-You were helping us.

226
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,485
We were going to find and
bring your sister to you.

227
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,058
Everything is going
as planned.

228
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:52,963
Your sister. ..
We've already captured your sister.

229
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:56,768
If something happens to me,
your sister will...

230
00:21:57,737 --> 00:21:59,796
Nothing will go your way.

231
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:03,076
Got that? Everything will
go according to my plans.

232
00:22:03,243 --> 00:22:05,075
What am I?

233
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,183
The monster inside of me.. .
wasn't inside me.

234
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,483
It was outside.

235
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:18,157
What are you trying to say?

236
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:22,590
Franz Bonaparta...

237
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:32,936
is alive, isn't he?
