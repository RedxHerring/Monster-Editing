1
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:21,567
Has there been any change
in the patient's condition?

2
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,178
Oh, No. But...

3
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:27,913
How is his blood pressure
and pulse?

4
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:31,876
Excuse me, Dr. Tenma, but what
about mayor Rodecker's operation?

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,544
I'm beginning the operation.

6
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:35,351
Oh... Okay.

7
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:39,125
Oh yeah.
What's the patient's name?

8
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:40,120
Huh?

9
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:42,358
What's this boy's name?

10
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:45,290
Well, umm...

11
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:48,926
You don't know his name,
do you?

12
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:56,878
<i>It's all right. Hang on.
I'll save you!</i>

13
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:01,448
Kill...

14
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,660
Kill...

15
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:23,463
Kill...

16
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,868
Those children!

17
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:29,006
The twins are nowhere
to be found!

18
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,443
Did you search carefully?

19
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:36,275
I did! I've searched everywhere!

20
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:39,082
Do you suppose that they're playing
hide-and-go-seek somewhere?

21
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:54,091
<i>Playing hide-and-go-seek
somewhere...</i>

22
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:48,347
Tenma the coward!
Tenma the coward! Hey!

23
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:52,889
It's no use hiding,
Tenma the coward!

24
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:57,795
If you try too hard to hide,
you'll pee in your pants again!

25
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,336
Look at how late it is.
How long are you going to play?!

26
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:11,807
Okay!

27
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,040
See you tomorrow!

28
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:14,081
See you later!

29
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:15,206
Bye bye.

30
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,817
See you later!

31
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:17,885
Bye bye.

32
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:18,745
Huh?

33
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:22,456
Oh... What about me?

34
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:33,231
Hey, everyone... I'm over here.

35
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:38,270
Find me.

36
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:43,038
I'm here!

37
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,473
Find me!

38
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,654
Tenma the coward, huh?

39
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:39,419
What should I do?

40
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:43,957
The man that came by this evening
is still in front of the mansion.

41
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:45,691
Who is he?

42
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,693
He's Richard Brown's
personal psychiatrist.

43
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,864
Brown's the detective we hired.

44
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:56,242
I'll throw him out right now.

45
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:02,206
Karl, I cannot see.
What kind of man is he?

46
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:03,243
Okay.

47
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:05,283
He's a man past middle age.

48
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,489
What do you think of him?

49
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,118
He doesn't look like a bad person.

50
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:19,426
And he seems kind of...
desperate.

51
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,134
I see...

52
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:34,881
Thank you for agreeing to see me,
Herr Schuwald.

53
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,479
Let's forget trifling introductions.
Time is short.

54
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,151
Let's hear what you have to say.

55
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,622
I also don't have much time.

56
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:48,924
It's up to you whether
this ends quickly.

57
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:52,232
Didn't you come to talk about him?

58
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,826
Huh?

59
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:56,931
Johan.

60
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:02,842
It seems it is.

61
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:10,017
I knew someone like you would
come to me sooner of later.

62
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,845
To solve this mystery.

63
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:15,681
Mystery–?

64
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:19,888
He's too perfect.

65
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:26,125
Those who can see
might not be able to tell.

66
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:32,237
I can sense when I'm before
something perfectly in harmony.

67
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:37,702
I wonder if it even exists
in this world.

68
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:40,776
He definitely exists!

69
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:44,879
Fragments of his past
are written here.

70
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,947
I'll read it to you right now.
You'll agree that he's not an illusion.

71
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,095
The story begins in 1986
and starts with

72
00:07:54,161 --> 00:08:00,294
a certain boy with a critical injury
being carried into a hospital.

73
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:12,237
And he appeared before you.

74
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:17,580
Richard died...no, he was killed.

75
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:19,084
According to his findings,

76
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:24,181
Johan was the one who had
Fahren act as if he was your son.

77
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:30,463
But when Karl,
your real son, appeared,

78
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:34,161
he changed his plans and
allied himself with Karl instead.

79
00:08:35,202 --> 00:08:38,263
And Fahren was
forced to commit suicide.

80
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,610
Why did you accept your son whom
you've been separated all these years?

81
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,547
Over the past few years, how many
of your trusted associates have died?

82
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:53,846
The driver who served you
for many years...

83
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:56,757
The maid who
read books to you...

84
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:59,387
Your accountant friend
who was a fellow birdwatcher...

85
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:01,192
They all died.

86
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:07,590
Johan has isolated you in order to
worm his way into your heart!

87
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:10,464
Please help me!

88
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:13,332
Expose everything to the public.

89
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:18,178
If not, that Japanese doctor...
Dr. Tenma will.

90
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:31,316
You said that it was as if Johan
was playing with a line of ants.

91
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:37,421
A line of ants, huh?

92
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:43,100
Do you know what I am called?

93
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:47,799
That's right.
The Vampire of Bavaria.

94
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:52,038
I happily accepted that name.

95
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,950
When I try to prove myself,
for some reason, it keeps getting bigger.

96
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,155
The monster inside me.

97
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:07,416
But what of it?

98
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:12,062
My nickname is exaggerated,
but I'm very small.

99
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:18,028
Come to think of it, I wanted to
be able to play with a line of ants.

100
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:19,938
Like this.

101
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:26,745
What I wanted to become...
he's trying to become.

102
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:35,815
"Who is like unto the beast?
Who is able to make war with him?"

103
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:40,990
The Apocalypse of
St. John the Divine, is it?

104
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:45,455
The only thing that would be
able to defeat the monster...

105
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:48,628
would have to be
a bigger monster, right?

106
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:08,148
Father.

107
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:13,025
What did you discuss?
It's already morning.

108
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:17,596
So...where's Johan?

109
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:23,730
He's headed to the ceremony
directly from the Esterhoven office.

110
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:29,935
Anyway, you look very tired.
Shall we cancel today's ceremony?

111
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:34,413
No. Let's prepare to go.

112
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:39,646
<i>Kill...</i>

113
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:41,652
<i>Kill...</i>

114
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:43,757
<i>Kill...</i>

115
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:57,165
<i>Doctor Tenma... It's not your fault.
You just did your job as a doctor.</i>

116
00:11:58,772 --> 00:11:59,898
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

117
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:07,245
<i>Survive. And try to save
as many people as you can.</i>

118
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:10,943
Nina...

119
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:41,340
How unfortunate.
Are you really going to quit?

120
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:44,079
You just got used to working here.

121
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:46,549
Thank you very much.

122
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:49,983
If you come around here again,
give me a call!

123
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:51,722
Yes. Good bye.

124
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,991
She was a good girl.

125
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:02,664
Oh... Hello?
Is Lotte Frank there?

126
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:05,469
<i>Lotte's out at the moment.</i>

127
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:11,603
I see. Please tell her that I'll be
departing Munich on the 3:00 train.

128
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:13,471
<i>All right. I'll tell her.</i>

129
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:15,140
<i>Oh. Could you tell me
your name again?</i>

130
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:16,275
It's Nina.

131
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:18,849
Nina Fortner.

132
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:46,639
He's here!

133
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:48,711
His car's arrived at
the back entrance.

134
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:55,647
The Vampire of Bavaria
finally makes an appearance.

135
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,257
He can hear you.

136
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:00,327
Did you see the guests
at the assembly hall?

137
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:02,690
Yes. Bavarians aren't
the only ones here.

138
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:05,159
People from the rest of Europe, and
Japanese businessmen are here, too.

139
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:06,596
It's crawling with ambassadors,

140
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,863
and high-ranking politicians
and businessmen.

141
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:12,739
You'd never think that this was
a book donation to a college.

142
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:13,432
Yeah.

143
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:17,641
That's because it's said that
all of Mr. Schuwald's actions

144
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:19,839
affect the European economy.

145
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:22,974
He doesn't show
his face very often.

146
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,348
So I suppose people
are bound to gather.

147
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:28,850
But for him to suddenly come here
and donate his book collection...

148
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:31,282
It's as if he's distributing mementos.

149
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:32,985
Hey, don't say such things.

150
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,527
He's an important part of
the EU's economy.

151
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:37,360
He has to live a little longer!

152
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:39,058
Karl.

153
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:42,428
Yes?

154
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:46,562
I forgot that there are important
documents that I want you to fetch.

155
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:48,772
What sort of documents?

156
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,277
Just go fetch them
from the mansion!

157
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:53,338
They're on the desk in my study.

158
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:54,904
But Father...

159
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:59,251
Johan's coming soon.
Leave this to him.

160
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:03,654
O-Okay.

161
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:25,336
What's going on
with the investigation?!

162
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,440
It's going smoothly.

163
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:28,872
Smoothly?!

164
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:31,182
I told you that
Tenma was in Munich

165
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:34,687
because I thought that you would
put more effort into the investigation.

166
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:37,182
But what are you doing?!

167
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,919
Did you investigate Johan Liebert,
who's working as Schuwald's secretary?!

168
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:45,596
There's no doubt that he's the true culprit
of the multiple homicide case.

169
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,224
Are you listening?!

170
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:49,098
If you don't hurry, Tenma will...

171
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,129
Tenma is trying to
settle everything by himself!

172
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,142
Don't worry.

173
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:04,212
The investigation is
going very smoothly.

174
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:07,379
Excuse me.

175
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:10,250
Johan is right before our eyes.

176
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:11,591
Investigate him quickly.

177
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,152
As I expected of a teacher
of criminal psychology.

178
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:18,025
That's a wonderful expression.

179
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:21,292
Johan does exist.

180
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,702
Johan does exist.

181
00:16:30,844 --> 00:16:32,437
In Tenma's head.

182
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:37,682
Have you gathered
any new testimonies?

183
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:41,055
No. It's all the same stuff.

184
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:45,356
The gun is a Mauser SR93.

185
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:47,754
It was sold to a Japanese man.

186
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:50,191
Should we squeeze him
a little more?

187
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:53,562
No. That's probably all he knows.

188
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:58,896
A Mauser SR93 is
a sniper rifle, isn't it?

189
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:01,742
Yes. It's of high efficiency.

190
00:17:03,176 --> 00:17:05,645
Who do you think
he plans to shoot?

191
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:11,746
I am Tenma...

192
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:20,392
I am Tenma. I have obtained
a highly efficient sniper rifle.

193
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:27,392
I am Tenma. And I...

194
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:30,168
I am Johan.

195
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:33,030
Who am I going to
shoot with this rifle?

196
00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:36,234
I killed the director and
others at my hospital.

197
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,111
I killed many middle-aged couples.

198
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:43,445
And, right now,
who am I going to kill?

199
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,045
I am...chaos.

200
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,687
I like chaos.

201
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:15,079
You should eat something.

202
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:22,150
Oh... Thank you, Dieter.
I'm all right. Don't worry.

203
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:27,587
I won't give up!

204
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:31,921
I may not look like much,
but I strengthened my body and mind

205
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:34,491
when I was a medic for
the border patrol police.

206
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:37,670
I'll do anything I can
to save your friend!

207
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:39,368
Anything!

208
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:44,574
Don't underestimate
a former police medic!

209
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:49,273
Now, you took the time
to make this.

210
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:50,575
And I'll gladly eat it.

211
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:54,886
You can't fight if you're hungry.

212
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:10,896
This is it.

213
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:15,104
Did you figure something out?!

214
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,003
Schuwald's
book donation ceremony!

215
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,271
Is Tenma there?!

216
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,008
Dieter, wait here!

217
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:25,885
Don't follow me!

218
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:31,648
Schuwald!

219
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:32,751
Huh?

220
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:37,291
I need to meet Hans Georg Schuwald
face-to-face. Contact him!

221
00:19:37,764 --> 00:19:38,390
Okay.

222
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,326
Oh...

223
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:44,094
Wait, today he's at
the book donation ceremony

224
00:19:44,171 --> 00:19:45,730
at the University of Munich Library.

225
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:48,505
We need an emergency
deployment there immediately.

226
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:49,335
Huh?

227
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:53,440
Tenma is after Schuwald.

228
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:58,981
So let's bring up to the stage
the man who donated

229
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:03,990
this huge collection to our library,
Hans Georg Schuwald!

230
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:17,561
Is Johan... Is my secretary here?

231
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:18,564
Huh?

232
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,807
He's over there.

233
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:36,246
You've come.

234
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:03,083
<i>I.. .brought him back to life.</i>

235
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:07,751
<i>I brought back that monster.</i>

236
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:15,155
Nina!

237
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,329
Lotte, you came!

238
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:25,605
Sorry.

239
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:30,336
I looked all over the place, but I couldn't
find the person I was looking for.

240
00:21:30,844 --> 00:21:32,403
We had just become friends.

241
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:33,880
It's unfortunate, but...

242
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:37,911
Could it be that you're twins?!

243
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,887
Aren't you?

244
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:42,255
Aren't you?

245
00:21:43,323 --> 00:21:44,791
What is this picture book?!

246
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,656
When he saw this,
he suddenly collapsed!

247
00:21:50,197 --> 00:21:51,164
Picture...book...

248
00:22:31,004 --> 00:22:32,494
<i>Kill...</i>
