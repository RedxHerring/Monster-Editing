1
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,093
Those two were really alone
before they came here...

2
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:18,370
When they were taken into custody
near the border of Czechoslovakia,

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,035
they were holding hands
as they walked.

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,903
They both were shivering in the cold...

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,811
I heard that the conditions
of the orphanages in the east side

6
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:30,044
were horrible...

7
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:33,243
We're not like 511 Kinderheim.

8
00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:34,321
Huh--?

9
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:49,297
Inge, the bathroom isn't that way...

10
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:50,794
Okay? See?

11
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:55,438
Mommy...

12
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:59,980
It's all right. It's all right...
There's nothing to be afraid of.

13
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:02,778
Now...you can go to the bathroom
by yourself, can't you?

14
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:14,286
Those kids really did not know
a parent's love.

15
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:18,294
You only need love in order to
develop as a person...

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,637
As you say, the orphanages
of the east side were quite horrible.

17
00:01:24,138 --> 00:01:28,575
Even this place was once referred to
as Orphanage 47.

18
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:33,143
But we did what we could so
we wouldn't be controlled

19
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:36,377
by the government,
even just a little,

20
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:39,421
in order to avoid
becoming like 511 Kinderheim.

21
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:43,317
It was a special orphanage
run by both

22
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,951
the Ministry of Health and Welfare
and the Ministry of the interior.

23
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:48,095
But you know what that means?

24
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:49,530
No...

25
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:52,466
The real state of affairs
were being managed by

26
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:53,796
the Ministry of the interior.

27
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:59,638
That place was...Old East Germany's
experimental laboratory...

28
00:03:38,873 --> 00:03:39,897
Experimental laboratory?!

29
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:43,741
They were running a project
that would turn the children

30
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:45,176
into perfect soldiers...

31
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,312
Psychological reconstruction...

32
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:51,546
Research on modifying humans...

33
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:59,019
They made the orphans
join factions and

34
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:02,996
observed as they fought each other...

35
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:08,701
It was an experiment to create cold,
merciless humans...

36
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:16,442
Can you imagine what these children
would be like when they grew up?

37
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,779
But right now, there's no way to prove
that was happening...

38
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:27,353
All the data was burned
right before the Wall came down...

39
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,255
The people from
the Ministry of the interior

40
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:32,224
who were involved with
the Project escaped.

41
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:42,061
But I heard there is one person
who was able to gloss his record

42
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:44,571
and remain in this country...

43
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,502
He was the person
who was overseeing

44
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:51,910
the devilish project
that was 511 Kinderheim.

45
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,383
He was actually
a pediatric psychiatrist

46
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,817
affiliated with
the Ministry of the interior...

47
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:04,354
Officially, he was a district official from
the Ministry of Health and Welfare...

48
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:08,487
District official from
the Ministry of Health and Welfare?

49
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:16,431
Inge, are you done
using the bathroom?

50
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:20,707
Yeah.
-Sweet dreams. Now then...

51
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,572
Good night...

52
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:24,110
Good night.

53
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,179
But all of that was covered up
by that incident...

54
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:33,715
That...incident?

55
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:37,454
What happened at 511 Kinderheim?!

56
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:40,421
It seems like I've talked
a little too much...

57
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:42,530
It made me remember
such awful things.

58
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:46,427
Please! Please tell me what
happened there!

59
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:53,871
Where's my soccer ball?

60
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:55,509
Huh?

61
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,840
Where's my...
Where's my soccer ball?

62
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:00,514
Oh...

63
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:07,245
Here you go.
It's right here.

64
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:14,585
But hold off on soccer
until your wounds have healed.

65
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:20,660
That man said he was going to come
to pick you up soon, so rest until then.

66
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:27,974
I don't know what really happened...

67
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,211
The East German government at
the time placed a strict gag order on it.

68
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:38,814
It all began with the mysterious death
of the director of 511 Kinderheim.

69
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:42,454
Soon after, there was
a power struggle among

70
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:45,925
the instructors over
the director's position...

71
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:49,488
The orphanage was
thrown into anarchy...

72
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:54,326
The children's internal strife
couldn't be controlled...

73
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:57,995
It's amazing that Johan
made it out of there.

74
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,000
And?! What happened to
511 Kinderheim?!

75
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:03,839
Everyone died...

76
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:05,212
Wha--?

77
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:10,041
All the members of the orphanage,
including the instructors

78
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:12,176
killed each other off in there.

79
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:24,429
<i>It's a big lie that the world is dark.</i>

80
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,857
<i>Tomorrow will be a good day.</i>

81
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:30,771
Dieter.

82
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,007
You're going home.

83
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:56,129
Say...

84
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:59,428
Mr. Hartmann, aren't we going home?

85
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,460
No...let's take a detour...

86
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,628
I-I don't want to go there...

87
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,449
No! No!

88
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:18,485
Dieter...

89
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:22,047
Dieter, you're a good boy, aren't you?

90
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:36,292
What?!

91
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:40,101
I told you not to hand over Dieter
until I returned!

92
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:41,771
B-But...

93
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,011
That person
was that child's foster parent...

94
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:48,243
He was also quite the gentleman...

95
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:50,182
Much more of a gentleman
than you are.

96
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:51,685
Uhh...

97
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:53,220
Well...

98
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:54,986
But that man...

99
00:08:55,256 --> 00:09:00,194
Besides, that boy
wanted to go with him.

100
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:08,959
Dieter!

101
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,817
Dieter!

102
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:33,493
Dieter?

103
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,993
They haven't returned?

104
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:45,799
Hartmann's study?

105
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:29,248
It seems that they were
taken at different times,

106
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:31,045
but were all taken at the same place.

107
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:33,243
Where is this place?

108
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:44,464
Johan...

109
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:52,002
Who's the man in the photo with him?

110
00:10:56,844 --> 00:11:02,044
I see... All the photographs
were taken at 511 Kinderheim...

111
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,179
About ten years ago up until now...

112
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:12,724
<i>All the members of the orphanage,
including the instructors,</i>

113
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:14,659
<i>killed each other of fin there.</i>

114
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,323
Dieter...

115
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:22,292
Could it be--?!

116
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,886
Dieter!

117
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:52,420
Dieter, hold on! I'm coming!

118
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,067
It seems that this boy can't see it...

119
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,937
Hartmann!

120
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:12,607
This boy can't see what Johan saw
from here back then...

121
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:18,912
It's no good... It's no good again...

122
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:22,081
This boy isn't Johan either.

123
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,897
Everyone... Everyone died...

124
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:39,131
Ten years ago...

125
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,335
The instructors and the orphans...

126
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,172
All fifty of them died...

127
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:53,785
Johan...watched it...

128
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:58,182
He watched it from here.

129
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:12,299
Johan...just watched it.

130
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:21,537
I asked Johan...

131
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:23,240
What...

132
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:26,213
What did you do?"

133
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,356
He replied...

134
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:33,623
I just dropped
a piece of oil-soaked cloth

135
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:35,423
in into the fire like this..."

136
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,206
What do you think?

137
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:49,005
Do you know what this means?

138
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,709
Hatred is created
when people gather.

139
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:57,411
I just poured a little oil on it..."

140
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:00,247
That's what he said.

141
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,956
A boy, just 10 years old.

142
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:06,416
And he pulled it off!

143
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:12,294
He had fifty people kill each other
without moving a finger.

144
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:15,335
Your...

145
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:20,131
Your experiments turned him into
that kind of person!

146
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,070
We did?

147
00:15:24,044 --> 00:15:25,011
No...

148
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:26,803
Not at all...

149
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:28,872
Not at all...

150
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:30,250
Huh?

151
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:34,211
511 Kinderheim was indeed
an experimental ground.

152
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:38,649
It was a project to raise orphans
to become perfect soldiers.

153
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,221
Thinking back on it now,
it was such a small experiment...

154
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:47,566
And what about Johan?
Him, a soldier?

155
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,762
Not at all...

156
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:53,463
He was a born leader!

157
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:56,866
He was someone who was
meant to stand at the top.

158
00:15:57,444 --> 00:16:00,812
There's no way we could create
such a work of art!

159
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:04,215
He was superhuman
from the beginning...

160
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:07,014
He was a monstrous being!

161
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:14,588
He foretold that everyone would
end up hating and killing each other.

162
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:19,528
What do you think Johan's goal was?

163
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:22,593
He said...

164
00:16:23,904 --> 00:16:28,933
To be the last person remaining
in this world..."

165
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,651
Dieter...The future is dark...

166
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:49,252
You've got to become even just
a little more like Johan...

167
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:52,899
But...

168
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,538
Why is it no good?

169
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:07,673
Why can't you be like Johan?!

170
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:09,407
Stop, Hartmann!

171
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,011
I'll shoot you if you
harm him any more!

172
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:14,721
Get out!

173
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:17,383
This is our problem.

174
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:19,225
Get out.

175
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:20,260
Dieter!

176
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:21,661
Come down from there!

177
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:25,422
Dr. Tenma!

178
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:29,694
You want to know about Johan,
don't you?

179
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:34,074
What are you going to do
once you do?

180
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,743
I think it's impossible to
find and kill him.

181
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,917
Fine...

182
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:46,885
I'll tell you one piece of information.

183
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:51,685
In exchange, once you hear it,
leave us alone.

184
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:09,376
Look for General Wolf. He's the one
who first discovered Johan's skill.

185
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:12,439
He should be alive somewhere.

186
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:16,108
Is he the man from the photograph
in your study?

187
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,012
Is he the man in the photograph
with Johan?

188
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:22,347
He's the one who brought Johan to us.

189
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,118
He should know something.

190
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:27,057
Now...get going.

191
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:30,196
Dieter!

192
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:34,333
Decide for yourself if you're
coming down from there!

193
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:39,272
There's nothing to worry about!

194
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:42,907
I'll shoot Hartmann if he puts
his finger on the rifle's trigger!

195
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:51,751
Dieter!

196
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:55,522
Decide for yourself!
Make your own decision!

197
00:19:00,694 --> 00:19:04,562
There's no way you'd leave me,
would you...Dieter?

198
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:09,101
Because you're my child...

199
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:16,738
That's how it is, Dr. Tenma.

200
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:18,607
Now leave.

201
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:46,673
Dieter...

202
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:50,002
That's right...it's all right...

203
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:53,672
That's good... Slowly... Slowly...

204
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:57,044
Dieter...come back.

205
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:59,211
My dear Dieter...

206
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:00,720
Dieter!

207
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:05,516
Do you think that you can live
without me, Dieter?!

208
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:07,424
Stop, Hartmann! If you move,
I'll shoot!

209
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:10,261
I love you!

210
00:20:11,264 --> 00:20:12,925
Dieter!

211
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:14,893
The world is dark!

212
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:17,296
Tomorrow is dark!

213
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:26,508
Tenma told me that tomorrow
will be a good day.

214
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:28,904
Dieter!

215
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:33,953
Be strong!

216
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:35,421
Don't be afraid!

217
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:47,593
Dieter!

218
00:20:49,402 --> 00:20:51,234
Dieter!

219
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,130
Dieter...

220
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:04,110
Dieter...

221
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,813
Dieter...

222
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,197
Now did you get that?

223
00:21:18,632 --> 00:21:21,624
Get on the bus here and get off
at Keunen Street...

224
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:23,962
The orphanage is right there.

225
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:28,072
Give this to Elna Tyce...
She's an instructor there.

226
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:32,741
She looks scary,
but she's a very nice lady.

227
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:35,782
Take care...

228
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,616
I can't stay in this town.

229
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,543
We part ways here.

230
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:43,517
A bus will come
in two or three minutes...

231
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,258
See you later.

232
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:48,383
Good luck with soccer.

233
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:04,573
No, you can't come with me...

234
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:06,212
Here.

235
00:22:10,317 --> 00:22:11,284
Dieter.

236
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:15,352
I'm telling you that you
can't come with me!

237
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:24,389
You can't...come with me...
