1
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:23,677
Ruhenheim...

2
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:26,413
This is it.

3
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,906
Hey, Ludwig!

4
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:03,801
Why are you barking?!

5
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:10,083
Did that bike
breakdown again?

6
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,451
Yeah. The chain always
comes loose.

7
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:18,284
As expected, bulky trash left at
a trash pick-up isn't any good.

8
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:22,227
It doesn't look like
bulky trash to me.

9
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:24,931
When I ride it,
everyone says,

10
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,161
"It's trash.
Trash is moving by."

11
00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:31,133
"Trash is riding by on trash"'
they say.

12
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,668
That's not true. It's a wonderful
five-speed super cycle.

13
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:43,643
Let me see it.
Let's adjust it one more time.

14
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,451
Oh. It looks like
there's a guest.

15
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:53,390
Yes. He called earlier.

16
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,928
Umm... You had a reservation?

17
00:02:58,132 --> 00:03:00,430
Yes. My name is Lunge.

18
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:04,966
Ah, Mr. Lunge,
thank you for coming.

19
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,910
I'm glad that a room was open
on such short notice.

20
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:12,506
Well, we always
have openings.

21
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:15,077
Is it still the off-season?

22
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,381
It's like an off-season
all year round.

23
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:22,950
The only guests staying here
right now are that couple over there.

24
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:25,989
The man's legs are bad.

25
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,022
And it seems like they've had
a rough time on their trip.

26
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,367
I'll take his bags.

27
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:35,666
I leave it to you Wim.

28
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:37,936
It's room 302.

29
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:42,703
How's the view
from that room?

30
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:46,308
I've given you the room
with the best view.

31
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,353
I'll leave your bags here,
okay?

32
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,117
I don't think it looks
like trash, either.

33
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:58,017
Huh?

34
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:01,624
I think it's a pretty
wonderful bike.

35
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:07,598
Inspector Lunge of the BKA?

36
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:10,805
Why are you here at
this rural police station?

37
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:16,142
Well, I was wondering how many more
officers I could gather for backup here.

38
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,105
Backup? More officers?

39
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,415
Well, If you asked
the state police,

40
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:24,383
they could supply you with quite
a few officers in under an hour.

41
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:29,179
But I don't think that a situation like
that would happen in a rural town like this.

42
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:34,155
Right now, you should start checking
everyone who comes into town.

43
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:34,988
Huh?

44
00:04:36,764 --> 00:04:39,165
Before something
terrible happens...

45
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,670
That's good ! Just like that!
It's running well!

46
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,405
Speeding up!
Changing gears!

47
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,042
Ow!

48
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:57,852
What happened, trash?

49
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,887
Can the trash still move?

50
00:05:01,522 --> 00:05:02,853
It's an eyesore!

51
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,616
Trash!

52
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:04,792
Stop.

53
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:05,826
Stop it!

54
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:08,891
Trash, trash!

55
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:19,506
Are you all right?

56
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:28,148
Are you alone?

57
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:31,646
Are you traveling
by yourself?

58
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,980
Yes.

59
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:34,379
Is this for work?

60
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,248
No, it's private.

61
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,892
Oh. Aren't you lonely
by yourself?

62
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:41,956
No. I'm used to it.

63
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:43,520
What about your family?

64
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:47,462
I have family.
My daughter had a son.

65
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:50,801
Oh? You have a grandchild?

66
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:52,930
Grandchildren are nice.

67
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:56,943
Our grandchild always
thinks about us.

68
00:05:57,812 --> 00:06:01,510
See, I'm writing them
a postcard now.

69
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:04,483
Letters are nice.

70
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,947
You can write things that you would
never be able to say in person.

71
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:12,451
How about it?
Care to write one, too?

72
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,929
A letter to my grandson...

73
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:18,023
What should I write?

74
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:20,561
Anything is fine.

75
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:24,367
If I could only draw...

76
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:32,337
Umm, excuse me.
Can I stay here for the night?

77
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,478
Yes. Of course.

78
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:39,782
You saved me.
I was enjoying a relaxing picnic.

79
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:42,366
But I got lost along the way,

80
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,258
and when I finally reached this town,
it was already late.

81
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,892
You're a lifesaver.

82
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:04,007
No one got off at
this town, huh?

83
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:13,186
A gunshot?

84
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:17,281
It didn't sound like a gunshot.

85
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:21,657
No. It definitely sounded
like a gunshot.

86
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:25,455
No one in this town has a gun.

87
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,031
Even if they did,
it's probably that drunk out back.

88
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:32,236
It would make a larger sound
if it were out back.

89
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,574
Besides, that drunk
wouldn't hit anything.

90
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:39,846
Wouldn't hit...

91
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,104
Honestly!

92
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:44,974
I lost again because of
your unlucky talk!

93
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:45,996
Honestly!

94
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,957
Shut up! It's not my fault!
Stop playing the lottery!

95
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:53,355
Ludwig...

96
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:56,063
Ludwig...

97
00:07:57,498 --> 00:07:58,659
Ludwig...

98
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:03,862
My Ludwig isn't anywhere!

99
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:07,031
There was something that
sounded like a gunshot earlier!

100
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:09,876
Could it be that
my Ludwig was...

101
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:11,235
My baby was...

102
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:16,182
Calm down, Mrs. Hillman.
There was no gunshot.

103
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:17,284
Calm down.

104
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,578
What's the matter?

105
00:08:20,488 --> 00:08:24,220
Oh. Well, this woman's dog
has gone missing.

106
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,258
Oh my...

107
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:27,021
That's worrying.

108
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:29,658
Anyway,
let's inform the police.

109
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,596
I've already gone
to the police!

110
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:33,560
But that man's no good.

111
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:36,295
He's an officer,
but I can't count on him at all.

112
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:38,472
He's an officer
who hates dogs.

113
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,701
Shall I look for him?

114
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,401
Huh? Are you sure,
Mr. Newmeyer?

115
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:48,306
Yes. I was going to stroll
around town anyway.

116
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:53,878
Yes, I know Mrs. Hillman's dog.

117
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:57,057
It's that stupid dog
that barks a lot, right?

118
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:00,753
He's gone missing.
Did you see him?

119
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:02,923
No, I haven't.

120
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:04,726
I see. Thank you.

121
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:10,869
By the way, have you seen any
suspicious strangers around town?

122
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:11,938
I have.

123
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:12,632
Oh?

124
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:14,738
You.

125
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,047
A dog?

126
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:23,606
What's this? I thought that you
were going to stay over here.

127
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:27,243
Sorry. I'm staying at
the Versteck Hotel.

128
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:30,956
What's with that? They're stealing
everyone's customers.

129
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:35,659
Which means that...
the guests you have now...

130
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:39,393
I don't have any. Thankfully,
it's quiet because of that.

131
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:44,102
So if that dog barks as much as it did
when it was nearby, I'd know immediately.

132
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:46,330
Did you hear barking today?

133
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:48,366
No, I didn't.

134
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,066
Maybe...

135
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:53,305
I heard something that
sounded like a gunshot earlier.

136
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:57,879
Perhaps some weirdo got angry at
the dog for being noisy and shot it.

137
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:10,229
Oh. Good day. Umm...

138
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:12,789
It's Lunge, Mr. Newmeyer.

139
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:14,967
Oh, Mr. Lunge,
where are you going?

140
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:17,464
I'm looking for a dog.

141
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:21,737
Oh, I see.
Have you found any leads?

142
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:23,035
No.

143
00:10:23,377 --> 00:10:26,836
Then let's continue
our search.

144
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:42,093
A drink. .. Give me a drink!

145
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:44,632
No. Dad, you shouldn't
drink anymore!

146
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:47,030
Go and buy me a drink already!
A drink!

147
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:48,694
I don't have any money!

148
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:51,761
You have the money you earned
from working at that hotel!

149
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,751
I wonder if I could buy one.

150
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:14,357
Wim, it's all right.
That's the money you've earned.

151
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:19,765
You got beaten
pretty badly today.

152
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:23,128
Come on.
Let's go to my hotel.

153
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,846
This is delicious!

154
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:44,958
It's unusual to see someone
eat as eagerly as you do.

155
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,820
Really? It's really delicious.

156
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:51,455
But they're just
regular sausages.

157
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,967
This is the face I make
when things are delicious.

158
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:54,927
Huh?

159
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:59,034
This is a nice town.
It's quiet and there's good food.

160
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:04,076
You think so? I want to get out of
this boring town as quickly as possible.

161
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:09,107
I wonder if there's someone wonderful
who can take me away from this place.

162
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,475
Has someone wonderful
come recently?

163
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:15,065
Not at all.
Everyday, it's the same faces.

164
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:16,079
I'm sick of it.

165
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,515
By the way, about the dog...

166
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:22,529
Oh, I've walked
that dog before.

167
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:24,030
Walked it?

168
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:28,765
When Mrs. Hillman had a cold,
I walked him for her.

169
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:34,173
When I let him have some Eisbein
from my deli, he wouldn't let go.

170
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,174
He pulled it away
with incredible force.

171
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,113
Where did he go?

172
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:44,985
Inspector Lunge!

173
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:49,181
As you've said, something
terrible has happened.

174
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,354
It's a dog.
A dog has gone missing.

175
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:55,318
Did you hear the gunshot?

176
00:12:56,163 --> 00:13:01,192
Oh, that wasn't a gunshot.
A car broke down by the highway.

177
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:04,500
That was probably the sound
of the car backfiring.

178
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:07,732
You won't hear a gunshot
in this town.

179
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:08,834
Later.

180
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:29,453
Things will get bad
if you frighten me.

181
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:37,304
There he is.

182
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,074
Ludwig...

183
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:43,507
You troublemaker.

184
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:46,875
You remembered that
you buried that bone here.

185
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:56,156
Hey, nice to see you,
Mr. Lunge.

186
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,857
It seems like different clues
led us to the same place.

187
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:04,528
What are you doing in this town?

188
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:07,264
And yourself?
What are you doing in this town?

189
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:09,299
You're a detective,
aren't you?

190
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:14,865
I had a hunch.
You have the air of a detective.

191
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:16,538
I'm on vacation.

192
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:20,976
You don't look as if
you're on vacation.

193
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:23,314
I was in Prague
not too long ago.

194
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:28,477
There I heard information about
someone involved in a certain case.

195
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:36,019
He was a tall man with a big bag.
He had a friendly, gentle smile.

196
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:38,056
His hair color...

197
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:46,038
You completely match the data
I have on this man, Mr. Newmeyer.

198
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:50,310
No. Mr. Grimmer.

199
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:55,648
Why did you come
to this town?

200
00:14:57,418 --> 00:15:03,755
It seems we really were led to the
same place through different clues.

201
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,717
Am I wrong?

202
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:11,195
Do you think that
you can stop

203
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,830
the terrible massacre that's
about to happen in this town?

204
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,851
Hey. Are you matching
lottery numbers again?

205
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,587
Your husband's going to
sweat away at work.

206
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:41,886
Don't talk so big.
You make so little.

207
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:42,655
What?!

208
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,762
Our future will be bleak
unless we win the lottery.

209
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,994
If you don't like that,
then earn more money.

210
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:51,263
Dear!

211
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:53,066
Shut up. What is it?

212
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:55,164
Dear...

213
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:57,073
What is it?!

214
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:58,569
I've won.

215
00:15:58,846 --> 00:15:59,813
Won what?

216
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:02,639
Th-The lottery.

217
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:04,645
Give it back!

218
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:07,278
Where did you put my bike?!

219
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:09,089
Give it back!

220
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:10,384
Shut up!

221
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,850
We don't know about
your bike, do we?

222
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:14,985
We threw away
some trash, though.

223
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:16,624
You threw it away?

224
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:18,090
Yeah.

225
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:21,324
We tossed it in the Vampire's House
in the West Hills.

226
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,162
Vampire...

227
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:27,373
Go by yourself if
you want to get it back.

228
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,969
We don't know what'll
happen to you if you do.

229
00:16:30,077 --> 00:16:31,670
You trash!

230
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,657
D-Dear...

231
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:53,396
Did anyone come?

232
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,567
N-No.

233
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:56,631
Be sure to put the chain on.

234
00:16:58,238 --> 00:16:58,864
Say...

235
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,063
Y-Yes?

236
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,139
You're sure this is
the number, right?

237
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:07,180
I-I've checked it many times.
I-I really won.

238
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:10,911
20 million marks, huh?

239
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:12,750
What should we do, dear?

240
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,284
I went to the neighboring town.

241
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,090
D-Dear! This...

242
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:25,229
It's just in case. It's dangerous to be
carrying that much money unarmed.

243
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:30,360
Well, you don't need it if we
make sure no one knows about it.

244
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:32,535
Y-Yeah.

245
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:33,773
What's wrong?

246
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:37,702
No one knows the number of
the lottery ticket you bought, right?

247
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:43,208
A-Actually,
when I bought that ticket...

248
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:45,442
<i>The usual.</i>

249
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,487
<i>Here you go.</i>

250
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:52,720
<i>You just don't win,
do you, Mrs. Henich?</i>

251
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:54,727
<i>Oh. Hello, Mr. Conrad.</i>

252
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:59,059
<i>Your husband was grumbling
about your lotto obsession.</i>

253
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:09,234
<i>You can use my birthday.
March 2, 1945. It wins pretty often.</i>

254
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,374
<i>I've hit the jackpot twice
at the horse races.</i>

255
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,245
<i>All right. Thank you.</i>

256
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:20,884
I-It can't be...

257
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:24,081
You used Conrad's birthday?

258
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,921
If he sees the number
in the newspaper...

259
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,667
B-But he doesn't know what
numbers you wrote, right?

260
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:38,894
I don't know. Rumors about it might
be spreading through town now.

261
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:40,235
C-Come to think of it...

262
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:41,374
W-What?!

263
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:45,969
On the way home, I stopped at the
general store to buy some cigarettes.

264
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:50,174
When I did, the girl from
the sausage shop was looking at me.

265
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:53,184
Oh! That's got to be it!

266
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,444
Me, too!

267
00:18:55,188 --> 00:19:01,855
When I was throwing away the garbage,
the drunk in the back was staring at me!

268
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:06,396
Who knows what that drunk would do
if he heard about the money!

269
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:07,433
Calm down!

270
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:08,468
- But.. .
- Listen.

271
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:11,766
We've got to
protect ourselves.

272
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:27,283
The Vampire's House...

273
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:47,171
I-It's dead.

274
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,326
Someone's here!

275
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:15,967
From the looks of it...

276
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:19,434
No one's come here recently.

277
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,534
Everything's uncompleted.

278
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,234
Did he stop drawing?

279
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:27,842
Or could he not draw?

280
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,088
Hey. Why it's Wim.

281
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:39,991
Mr. Newmeyer...
Mr. Lunge...

282
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:42,491
What are you doing here?

283
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:48,296
U-Umm... My bike... My friends said
that they dumped my bike here.

284
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:51,630
Ah. Your friends tricked you.

285
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:55,875
Your bike was in a bush at
the bottom of the mountain path.

286
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,103
Anyway...

287
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:04,114
It seems like that cat was shot
with a submachine gun.

288
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:06,852
They've already...

289
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:09,250
Yes. They're nearby.

290
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:15,320
Look.

291
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:19,523
A drawing of the twins...

292
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:20,392
Yes.

293
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:23,970
And this...

294
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,707
And this...

295
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,009
And this...

296
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:32,044
And this...

297
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:34,213
And this...

298
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:36,983
And this...

299
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:39,986
They're about ten-years old.

300
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:46,625
Those twins were about ten when
I was in charge of Tenma's case.

301
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,656
These are pictures drawn
around that time.

302
00:21:50,564 --> 00:21:53,033
How many other pictures
like this one are there?

303
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:59,834
No matter how many times he
drew it... he was never satisfied.

304
00:22:03,443 --> 00:22:04,535
My, my...

305
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:07,576
Looks like there're going to
be a lot of vines this year.

306
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:11,308
I'm worried about this year's
lingonberry crop.

307
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,124
Hey. I haven't seen you before.
