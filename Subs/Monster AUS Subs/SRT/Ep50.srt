1
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:14,128
Oh, that mansion
is right up this hill.

2
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,497
I see. Thank you.

3
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:18,765
You're welcome.

4
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:43,864
Roses, huh?

5
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:47,365
Just like sleeping
beauty's castle...

6
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:22,859
<i>My name is Anna.
Anna Liebert.</i>

7
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:26,432
<i>Good luck,
Mr. Great Detective!</i>

8
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:30,602
<i>She was worried that
something might happen to you.</i>

9
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:35,476
<i>I feel the same way
about you as your mother.</i>

10
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:40,807
Anna...

11
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:44,877
Were you dreaming,
Detective Suk?

12
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,545
W-Who are you?

13
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:51,850
Lunge...
An inspector with the BKA.

14
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:53,923
BKA?!

15
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:54,888
Oh.

16
00:02:55,496 --> 00:03:01,333
You can lie down.
I didn't come here to arrest you.

17
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,808
This is a pretty nice
hospital room.

18
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:12,276
I arrived here by checking out
hospitals that were involved with

19
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:15,577
the former Czechoslovakian
secret police under the old regime.

20
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:17,284
Judging by your treatment...

21
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,657
You must be pretty important to
the Czechoslovakian secret police.

22
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:24,616
No. I just...

23
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,821
I know everything about you.

24
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:31,360
The fact that Inspector Zeman, who
had close ties with the secret police,

25
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:32,422
was beaten to death...

26
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:36,833
The fact that the Prague police chief and
two detectives were poisoned to death...

27
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:42,300
The fact that the two detectives who
were following you were found shot dead...

28
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:49,307
And the fact that you are being pursued
because you are an important witness...

29
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:53,744
In any of these incidents, if you were to
look at just the circumstantial evidence,

30
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:54,788
you're the culprit.

31
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:57,653
No! I didn't do anything!

32
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:02,220
Then what about Grimmer, the tall
man who Inspector Zeman questioned

33
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:04,162
the day before
he was beaten to death?

34
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,326
Grimmer's also not the culprit!
He's not the sort of person to do that!

35
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:09,902
Then who's the culprit?

36
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,232
You know, don't you?

37
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:17,977
You know who the culprit is,
don't you?

38
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:22,407
W-What are you talking about?

39
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,348
This wouldn't be happening
to me if I knew.

40
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:28,687
I've been betrayed by
all sorts of people.

41
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,222
I've been made out to be the culprit
and the police are after me.

42
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:38,055
I've had enough ! I don't want to be
betrayed by anyone anymore!

43
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:41,463
You're a detective, aren't you?

44
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:48,439
If you're a detective,
you must dissect everything calmly.

45
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:52,443
You must dig up the truth
as rationally as you can,

46
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:55,278
even at the expense of
destroying your own happiness.

47
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:04,354
If you don't want to be
betrayed anymore,

48
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:07,588
doubt the people you
don't ever want to doubt.

49
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:20,297
Who gave you permission
to see him?

50
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,008
Take me to your boss.

51
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,080
Tell him I want to talk to him
about the Rose Mansion.

52
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,858
That'll make him
want to see me.

53
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,265
Inspector Lunge of the BKA...

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,765
I've looked up your identity
and your past.

55
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:51,936
I also heard rumors
about you

56
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:54,338
when the old regime
was in force, Captain Lanke.

57
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:59,643
And now, you're essentially the leader
of the Czechoslovakian secret police.

58
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:03,848
It's a big position with quite a lot of
trouble attached to it at the moment.

59
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:06,044
Thank you for your concern.

60
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,150
I envy the fact that you can
take a long vacation.

61
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:15,990
I hear that two years ago your forceful
investigation drove a man to suicide.

62
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,862
He was the secretary
to Senator Boltzmann,

63
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,664
a candidate for the leadership
of the German Democratic Party.

64
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:25,437
You have to know how
to get ahead in the world.

65
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,300
You're fools!

66
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:33,344
If you took a softer line and

67
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:36,406
actually managed to conceal
your activities during democratization,

68
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:40,387
you could have emerged as
the secret president of this country.

69
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,986
But the fear that the people have
of you is now all but a mere illusion.

70
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:52,162
I see. You're smart.

71
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:55,660
If you're so smart,
what do you want from me?

72
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:59,865
No. As you know,
I'm on a long vacation.

73
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:01,842
This is partially for fun.

74
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:04,542
I'm looking for something.

75
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:08,973
For true fear...

76
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:18,723
I want to know if a real demon was
born from the illusion you created.

77
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:23,329
Would you be referring
to Red Rose Mansion?

78
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:32,739
I went all over the place
to reach that mansion.

79
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:37,508
This author had many,
many pseudonyms.

80
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:42,809
The author of <i>The Nameless Monster</i>
is Emile Scherbe.

81
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,986
He lived in an old building
in Prague.

82
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,485
A company is renting
that room at the moment.

83
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,256
Under another alias,
Klaus Poppe,

84
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:52,622
was an old farm in the suburbs.

85
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,059
The farm has already
been destroyed.

86
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,765
Under another alias, Jakub Farobek,
was a rental office.

87
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:06,195
So. ..you've finally arrived.. .
at Franz Bonaparta?

88
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,901
What is that mansion?

89
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:16,044
Who is Franz Bonaparta?

90
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,379
No matter how hard I search,
I can't find anything on him.

91
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,452
Which means that
he's one of you.

92
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:29,094
He's with the former
Czechoslovakian secret police.

93
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:31,563
What do you want to know?

94
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,968
I want to know what you know.

95
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,633
I don't know anything.

96
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:40,099
But...

97
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:41,367
But?

98
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:46,836
There is something I've been
consciously trying to forget.

99
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,780
I tried to forget the existence
of that mansion.

100
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:58,190
That's why it still
stands there untouched.

101
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:02,152
The political criminals
who were taken there,

102
00:09:02,229 --> 00:09:05,893
all the researchers who were there,
disappeared one day.

103
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:11,295
That's all.

104
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:18,768
What's the reason for the wall?

105
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:20,273
Wall?

106
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:24,985
I went inside the mansion
the other day.

107
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:29,552
There was no sign of any human
entry. It was completely abandoned.

108
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:33,190
But the wall to the north
on the second floor...

109
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:38,190
The wall was plastered over as if
to hastily seal something away.

110
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,001
That wall...
May I break it down?

111
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:55,080
What are you afraid of,
Captain Lanke?

112
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,642
You might die.

113
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:08,621
If you get any closer to it, you
and I might end up seeing true fear.

114
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:57,962
Franz Bonaparta?

115
00:11:58,172 --> 00:11:59,799
That name
brings back memories.

116
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,966
Would you like milk or sugar
in your coffee?

117
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:04,975
Oh. Black is fine.

118
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:08,407
What is it?

119
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,876
Well...

120
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:14,545
I never expected a Franz
Bonaparta fan to appear now.

121
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,083
I heard from Moravia Publishing
that you, Mr. Zobak,

122
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,858
were Mr. Bonaparta's editor
for a long time.

123
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:24,891
Yes.

124
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:31,905
But I was in charge of him when he
was using the pseudonym, Klaus Poppe.

125
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:35,966
I want to know what
kind of person he was.

126
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:38,939
Franz Bonaparta, huh?

127
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:43,011
He came to this house to
make work arrangements.

128
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:47,954
Yes. He sat right on
that chair just like that.

129
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,321
He often played with
my daughter in the yard.

130
00:12:57,164 --> 00:13:00,464
But at the time, my daughter
said something strange.

131
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:03,936
She said,
"that man is scary."

132
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:12,637
My daughter probably doesn't
remember that now.

133
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,844
Did he work for a government agency
during that time?

134
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:21,848
Probably. I assumed that was the
case when I was doing business with him.

135
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:27,558
But judging by his demeanor, the way
he talked and the clothes he wore...

136
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:30,958
He had a mildness and elegance
that was nothing like

137
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,999
the important figures
of the old regime.

138
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,764
Bonaparta had
a doctorate in psychiatry.

139
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:41,338
He was also a psychologist.
His specialty was neurosurgery.

140
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:43,176
O-Okay.

141
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:48,638
When was the last time
I saw him?

142
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:52,279
I believe it was
the summer of '81 or '82.

143
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:58,921
Yes. That day, he wandered to
my house. He told me his new story.

144
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:02,518
Oh, he looked strangely sullen.

145
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:05,962
New story?
What kind of story was it?

146
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:11,737
A story where
a monster falls in love.

147
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:18,801
But it was like a mix between <i>Beauty
and the Beast</i> and <i>Sleeping Beauty.</i>

148
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:21,042
I rejected it.

149
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:25,177
Then, at the door,
just as he was about to leave...

150
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:31,884
He turned and said,
"then what about this?"

151
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,491
"A story about a door that
should never be opened."

152
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:39,655
I asked him whether there was
paradise on the other side

153
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:41,360
or whether a monster
would come out.

154
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:49,106
He said, "No. It should never be opened,
so I guess it's not much of a story."

155
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:52,635
He laughed as
he said that and left.

156
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:56,115
That was the last time
I saw him.

157
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:08,024
Did he tell you anything important
about Bonaparta?

158
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:10,687
No. Nothing important.

159
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:14,596
Mr. Grimmer,
what were you doing here?

160
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:20,171
I was thinking that
it sure is a nice day.

161
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:24,244
It sure is.

162
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,147
I knew it.

163
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:34,451
Oh, hello? Is this the police?
My name is Zoback at Schweig Court.

164
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:37,056
A man just came to my house.

165
00:15:37,624 --> 00:15:42,528
I think he's a prime suspect in a multiple
homicide that happened in Germany.

166
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:46,990
Yes. He's Japanese.
The neurosurgeon, Dr. Tenma!

167
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:04,674
Ethanol...
the smell of disinfectant.

168
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:35,842
Death? How many?
How many people died here?

169
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:40,877
Ten... Twenty...

170
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:43,950
No. More.

171
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,805
That woman...

172
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:10,048
The woman from
the sketchbook...

173
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:13,547
The mother of the twins...

174
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,653
If you don't hurry, the older students
will take the soccer field!

175
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:25,624
Hurry up, Milosh!

176
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:27,295
Oh. Okay.

177
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,760
Go! Counter attack!

178
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:30,462
Oh no!

179
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:32,335
Stand back!
The goal's wide open!

180
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:34,633
They got us!
They got a goal!

181
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:39,279
Milosh!

182
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:40,777
Are you all right, Milosh?!

183
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:42,211
Get a hold of yourself,
Milosh!

184
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:48,765
Nice defense,
Milosh!

185
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:51,121
Nice clear!
You protected the goal!

186
00:17:57,564 --> 00:18:00,795
That laugh...
He's all right now, isn't he?

187
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,402
What do you think,
Dr. Tenma?

188
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:06,265
Yes.

189
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:15,839
Mr. Grimmer, aren't you going to
see Milosh and the other children?

190
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:22,353
I realized why
I wasn't good at soccer.

191
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:25,221
It's teamwork.

192
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,989
What do you think will
happen to Detective Suk?

193
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:35,961
He's wanted as a prime suspect
in a murder.

194
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:38,997
He's pretty much done-for,
socially speaking.

195
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:43,634
Even if he turns himself in,
how will he prove his innocence?

196
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:46,843
How will he prove
that there was

197
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:48,847
a blonde woman leaving
the crime scene?

198
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:55,853
Suk is in the same situation as you.
Except for one thing.

199
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,827
This is goodbye, Doctor Tenma.

200
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:03,055
Huh?

201
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:08,961
There's only one person who knows the
details about the latest string of events.

202
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:11,304
He's right here.

203
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:17,472
What do you think of sending
this to the police?

204
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:21,974
What's this?

205
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:25,782
It's a letter from
the serial killer...

206
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:33,155
I reveal in detail secrets that
only the murderer would know.

207
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:37,463
B-But if you send this
to the police, you'll be...

208
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:42,233
Grimmer will suddenly
return to Germany.

209
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:47,963
The police will cast a dragnet,
but Grimmer will get away.

210
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:54,081
That's because he used to
be a skilled spy.

211
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:58,341
But you'll be a suspect and be forced
to run away for the rest of your life!

212
00:19:58,485 --> 00:19:59,452
That's all right.

213
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:05,254
Because the person known as
Grimmer never existed to begin with.

214
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:08,861
Someone just gave
that role to me.

215
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:13,930
Even if Grimmer is a suspect for the
rest of his life, I'll be completely fine!

216
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,296
Just kidding.

217
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:20,265
What do you think of
this method, Dr. Tenma?

218
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:23,538
Oh. No.
That's all right.

219
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:27,780
You're going to the Rose Mansion,
aren't you?

220
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:29,644
Y-Yes.

221
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:33,782
You might be close
to your goal.

222
00:20:34,221 --> 00:20:36,155
No. I don't know that.

223
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,560
I'd tell you to not do anything rash,
but you won't listen.

224
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,120
But please don't die.

225
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:51,397
Mr. Grimmer...

226
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:55,732
That promise we made when
we crossed the Czech border...

227
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:59,435
When we meet again,
let's have a picnic.

228
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,609
We'll fish for trout in surrounded
by wonderful scenery.

229
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,977
We'll have good wine
and cheese.

230
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,587
Until we meet again!

231
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:32,367
From now on I have to live
in fear of that sound.

232
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,851
It hurts!

233
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,149
It hurts!

234
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:51,893
What's wrong?
Let me take a look at that!

235
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:55,700
It's just a scratch.

236
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:58,028
I'll just apply some antiseptic.

237
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:05,103
O-Owowow!

238
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,004
You're a boy, aren't you?
Bear with it!

239
00:22:10,684 --> 00:22:12,277
Good. You're a strong boy.

240
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:21,895
You're Kenzo Tenma,
aren't you?

241
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,000
We're the police !
Come with us to the station.
