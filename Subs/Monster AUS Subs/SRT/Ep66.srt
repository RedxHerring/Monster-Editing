1
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:08,596
<i>Mom...</i>

2
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:12,759
<i>Don't let go of my hand, mom.</i>

3
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:15,092
<i>Mom...</i>

4
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:17,104
<i>Mom...</i>

5
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:04,873
The man. ..was Czechoslovakian
of German decent.

6
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:07,574
He was the oldest son
of a family

7
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,880
that remained in Bohemia
after the Second World War.

8
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,649
He was a soldier who graduated
from a military academy.

9
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,453
He was an elite, someone who was
to lead the country in the future.

10
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:25,127
His name...
His name is not important.

11
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,537
The woman...

12
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:37,775
was the only daughter of a
Moravian elementary-school teacher.

13
00:02:38,913 --> 00:02:43,350
She was a beautiful blonde-haired,
blue-eyed woman.

14
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,048
She went the University of Bruno.
She majored in genetic engineering.

15
00:02:50,992 --> 00:02:53,791
Her teachers had
great expectations for her.

16
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:54,953
She was a talented woman.

17
00:02:57,065 --> 00:03:00,695
Her name. ..
Her name...is not important.

18
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:12,105
The two met at a cafe in Prague. It
didn't take long for them to fall in love.

19
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:21,649
Not long after,
the woman became pregnant.

20
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:27,619
And the man
made a confession.

21
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:32,391
"This was a mission"' he said.

22
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,734
He told her that there was
an experiment being conducted

23
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:43,766
involving several dozen
couples of men and women

24
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:48,874
chosen for their race, intellect, physique,
and athletic abilities to produce children,

25
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,784
and that they were
one of those couples.

26
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:59,453
The man had followed
the orders as planned,

27
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:02,462
but he said that he no longer
wanted to do so anymore.

28
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:05,561
Then he said...

29
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:09,095
Let's run away.

30
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:15,708
The two of them ran away.

31
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:39,565
The man said that he wouldn't
do things as planned.

32
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:45,169
But his actions were
already a part of the plan.

33
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:04,614
The woman was isolated
in an unfamiliar room.

34
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,198
<i>Let me see him.</i>

35
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,510
<i>He's been assigned
a new mission.</i>

36
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:24,809
<i>Let me see him.</i>

37
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,074
<i>He's been assigned
a new mission.</i>

38
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:30,011
<i>Let me see him.</i>

39
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:32,953
<i>He's been assigned
a new mission.</i>

40
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,452
The woman said...

41
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:39,689
"Let me see him.
Let me see him."

42
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:43,587
"Let me see him.
Let me see him."

43
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:51,863
She knew that he
was no longer alive.

44
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:07,950
Her unborn children grew well.
They were twins.

45
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:11,422
<i>Turn your head this way.</i>

46
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:20,030
The woman began to realize that
the man who came to visit often...

47
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:24,264
the man who was sketching her...

48
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:29,270
was the man responsible
for the whole experiment.

49
00:06:32,747 --> 00:06:37,651
<i>I won't forgive you.
I will never forgive you.</i>

50
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:47,157
<i>Even if I die, the children who are
growing inside of me will get revenge.</i>

51
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:51,465
<i>You say the most
interesting things.</i>

52
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:59,797
The due date came and
the moment of birth had arrived.

53
00:07:02,977 --> 00:07:06,709
When she was being moved to a different
room to calm her of her labor pains,

54
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:09,216
she finally sprang into action.

55
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:27,495
It was only a several
dozen centimeters wide...

56
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:35,636
Pregnant and wracked with labor pains,
she escaped through a ventilation duct.

57
00:07:47,388 --> 00:07:51,916
She collapsed on the road several
dozen meters from the gate.

58
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:55,526
Her water broke.

59
00:07:58,032 --> 00:07:59,761
<i>How beautiful.</i>

60
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:03,033
<i>What beautiful children.</i>

61
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:08,335
<i>So these children are the ones who
will lead the future of the human race.</i>

62
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:10,967
<i>Wonderful.</i>

63
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,678
<i>I thought of names for them.</i>

64
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,221
<i>You don't need to think
of unnecessary things.</i>

65
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:29,191
<i>I thought of names for them.</i>

66
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:31,832
<i>You don't need
to think about that.</i>

67
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:34,868
<i>Names...</i>

68
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:39,804
<i>Give them names.
Give them...</i>

69
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:48,209
<i>It's all right.
They don't need names.</i>

70
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:05,427
Franz.. .Bonaparta...

71
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:07,424
That's right.

72
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:12,037
Johan asked me about
where he was.

73
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,470
Is Bonaparta alive?

74
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:24,382
"I won't forgive you.
I will never forgive you."

75
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:33,419
"Even if I die, the children who are
growing inside of me will get revenge."

76
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,958
Franz Bonaparta is still alive,
isn't he?

77
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,745
You should ask Johan.

78
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:06,420
He's over there.

79
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:18,628
What a terrible doctor.

80
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:26,847
There's a hospital up ahead.

81
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:30,676
I'll take you there if you tell me
where Johan is.

82
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:35,086
At this rate,
you're going to bleed to death.

83
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:41,325
I-I don't know
what I don't know.

84
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:47,025
Tell us immediately.

85
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,601
What a terrible doctor.

86
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:56,205
You shoot me with a gun,
you make me bleed like this...

87
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:57,642
and you threaten me...

88
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:07,945
Where is Johan?!

89
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:15,053
What a terrible doctor.

90
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,643
Tell us now! Right now!

91
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:32,676
I don't know
what I don't know...

92
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:35,274
Eva...

93
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:40,379
Over there.
There's a pay phone.

94
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,847
Call the hospital and tell them
that there's an injured person

95
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:46,256
who's bleeding excessively
in this car.

96
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:50,722
W-What are you saying?!
He's about to tell us where Johan's-

97
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,323
His life will be in danger
if we stall any longer.

98
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:56,332
Hurry. Call them.

99
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:18,459
You saved again.

100
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:26,364
You're always like this.
You can't kill people.

101
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:37,568
He wants to see you.

102
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:45,281
I'll tell you where Johan is.

103
00:12:57,531 --> 00:13:01,229
Kenzo, the hospital's sending
an ambulance right away.

104
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:03,194
Let's get away from here
immediately.

105
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:13,980
Where's Kenzo?!

106
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:17,183
He left.

107
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,851
He left a message for you...

108
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:29,989
"I can't let you get involved
any further. I've ruined your life."

109
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:37,065
"I'm very sorry.
Please find happiness"' he says.

110
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:47,438
Why are you crying?

111
00:13:58,258 --> 00:13:59,225
I don't understand.

112
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:04,693
I don't understand at all.

113
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,466
Johan.

114
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:48,658
<i>Welcome home.</i>

115
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,742
<i>L-It's a fire!</i>

116
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:03,047
<i>The Three Frogs is on fire!</i>

117
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,771
Go on, eat.

118
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:31,308
If you eat that quickly,
you're going to choke.

119
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:33,906
You must have
been really hungry.

120
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,674
Where did you two
come from?

121
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,086
What are your names?

122
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:44,958
You don't talk at all,
do you?

123
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,528
Fine. We can talk once
your stomachs are full.

124
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:53,333
Wait!

125
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,027
Wait!

126
00:16:57,304 --> 00:16:58,362
Wait for me!

127
00:16:58,438 --> 00:16:59,428
This way!

128
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,633
What should we do?

129
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:03,733
What do you mean?

130
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,503
Those children...

131
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:09,175
They don't have any parents,
do they?

132
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:15,646
Even if they did, maybe there's
a reason they don't want to go back.

133
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:22,892
We've always
wanted children, right?

134
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:24,390
Yeah.

135
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,659
We could take them in.

136
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:29,998
Don't be foolish!

137
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:38,575
Sorry. I didn't mean to be harsh.

138
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:42,542
Anyway, let's call the police.

139
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:45,681
What's wrong, son?

140
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:02,729
Look, look. A pretty flower.

141
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,100
I'm going to give it to
the man and the lady.

142
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:08,274
You don't have to.

143
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:09,235
Huh?

144
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:14,442
I told you, didn't I?
I have a good plan.

145
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:16,475
Come on.

146
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,880
Oh, honestly!

147
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:22,453
Wait!

148
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,157
Wait!

149
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:27,389
Wait! Wait!

150
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:57,149
We finally meet.

151
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:03,692
When I escaped from
Red Rose Mansion,

152
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:08,930
you greeted me when I got to
the room at the Three Frogs.

153
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:13,573
So this time,
I'll say it to you...

154
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:15,742
Welcome home.

155
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:25,711
A lot of time has passed since I came
for you in Heidelberg on our 20th birthday.

156
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:30,050
You came for me?

157
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:32,915
You came to kill.

158
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:39,861
The Fortners and
the Lieberts...

159
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:43,969
Everyone who had
been kind to us...

160
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:47,205
You killed them all!

161
00:19:55,315 --> 00:19:56,476
<i>Please come back to life!</i>

162
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:03,181
Huh?

163
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:08,918
I said, "Today's a nice day,
isn't it?"

164
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:11,626
Oh. Yes.

165
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:16,536
Driver...

166
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,363
Yeah?

167
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:21,602
Could you hurry a little?

168
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:27,171
<i>It's all right.
Hang in there.</i>

169
00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:30,508
Shoot me.

170
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:32,079
Kill...

171
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,287
I'll save you.

172
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,277
Are you going to shoot me
like you did then?

173
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,373
Yes.

174
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:03,376
I'm going to
put an end to this.

175
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:05,877
The end...

176
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:09,547
What is the end?

177
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,557
The end...

178
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:13,025
The end...

179
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:14,393
The end...

180
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:15,895
The end...

181
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:17,563
The end...

182
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:19,532
The end...

183
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:26,696
I've seen the end of
the world over and over.

184
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:34,072
What is the end?

185
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:37,016
This will end.

186
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:40,478
You're going to die
and I'm going to die.

187
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:43,756
You've seen it?

188
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:49,556
What did you see?!

189
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,031
What have you seen?!

190
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:07,011
You don't know.

191
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:14,282
I'll tell you...

192
00:22:16,623 --> 00:22:18,591
a truly terrifying story.

193
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:33,673
<i>I'm back.</i>
