1
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:10,287
Maurer, you haven't been
taking a bath, have you?

2
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:13,811
You promised, when I moved
to the desk next to you,

3
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:16,065
that you'd take one every other day.

4
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:18,795
You're such a pest.

5
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:21,498
You have a visitor
in the reception office.

6
00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:25,705
I'm going home,
so make your own tea, will you?

7
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:28,108
A visitor? At this hour?

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,212
He hasn't had a bath, either.
He smells almost as bad as you do!

9
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:38,524
What the hell...?
Upsy daisy!

10
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:42,831
And whose fault is it that
I haven't been able to take a bath?

11
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:49,704
She doesn't realize that she's able to
make a living at this paper

12
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:54,004
with no future,
thanks to me.

13
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,342
Jeez.

14
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:58,736
Sorry to keep you waiting. Huh?

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,380
Uh... My name is Tenma...

16
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:04,351
I'd like to ask for your assistance!

17
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:07,847
Right... He really is filthy...

18
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,787
I see, so you're a doctor...

19
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:14,693
You don't look like one.

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,498
In other words, Doctor,
is this what you're trying to say?

21
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:22,513
The next target of the person
who's been killing

22
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:25,097
middle-aged couples
throughout Germany

23
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,901
is here in Heidelberg?

24
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:31,922
That couple is fostering a young girl,
and when that girl turns 20,

25
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:34,176
the killer will come to take her away...

26
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:38,086
And when he does, the foster parents
are sure to be killed...

27
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:43,581
But you have no idea
who that girl or her foster parents are,

28
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:44,989
or where they live...

29
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:53,190
If that's not delusional,
I don't know what it is.

30
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:56,098
It's not a joke. Please believe me.

31
00:01:56,638 --> 00:02:01,166
Ridiculous! Not even the gossip rags
would write up that story.

32
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:03,868
I didn't come here
to get you to write it up!

33
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:06,676
After those twins
slipped out of the hospital,

34
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,592
there is at least
a 6-month blank period

35
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:10,550
before the brother showed himself.

36
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:12,181
So what?

37
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:15,354
I believe that,
after leaving the hospital,

38
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:18,051
those twins came to
Heidelberg together.

39
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,353
You believe...

40
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:24,358
And the two were raised by
the girl's current foster parents.

41
00:02:24,932 --> 00:02:27,958
But the brother ran away from here
after a short period,

42
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:29,003
leaving his sister behind.

43
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:34,001
Why don't you write a novel?
'Course it probably won't sell.

44
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:37,106
It is possible that there is
a missing person's report out on the boy.

45
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:40,713
And there might even be
a newspaper article about him!

46
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:46,310
Please let me check the newspapers
from nine years ago! Please!

47
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,126
Please!

48
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:55,627
We mustn't allow
any more people to be killed!

49
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:58,232
Please...

50
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:13,074
The president has a thing against
computerization, you see...

51
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:17,194
These are smaller versions
of the daily newspapers,

52
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:18,344
and manuscript files.

53
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:23,447
And these are files
of cancelled stories and raw data.

54
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:26,153
T-Thank you very much!

55
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:31,693
Is that the Japanese bow...?
You're quite welcome.

56
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,459
Let me say this...

57
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,560
I just don't have the time
to spend on silly stories.

58
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:40,197
Hurry up and leave
when you're satisfied!

59
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:47,310
Jeez! Every once in a while,
I get a nut case like him.

60
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,186
<i>Please...</i>

61
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:55,588
<i>Please let me find something!</i>

62
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:31,282
Good morning, Nina!

63
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:32,753
Good morning!

64
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:35,684
Thank goodness.
You're looking well, Nina.

65
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,487
Fainting like that...
You startled me.

66
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:41,857
I guess you really didn't like
the boy we hooked you up with.

67
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:43,858
T-That's not true.

68
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:47,658
I just suddenly felt bad.
I have to apologize to him.

69
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:50,905
Oh, never mind.
You don't have to worry about him.

70
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:52,105
Huh?

71
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,607
That Otto... When I talked to him,

72
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,007
I found out that he's not
your "prince on a white horse."

73
00:05:57,612 --> 00:06:01,515
He says he didn't send you
any email message.

74
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:03,851
Is that so...?

75
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:12,522
So you're saying that you fainted
because you saw that boy?

76
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,027
Yes...

77
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:15,660
What did he look like?

78
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:19,467
I only saw him for a second,
so I'm not sure...

79
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:23,332
What was your impression of him?

80
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:26,535
It felt very nostalgic...

81
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,342
Oh...

82
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:33,438
But that's not it...
I can't explain it well, but...

83
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:34,982
But...?

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,094
You needn't force yourself, Nina.

85
00:06:55,636 --> 00:06:56,694
Absolute evil...

86
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,401
I don't know how to put it, but...

87
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:04,742
Yes, it felt just like
when I had that nightmare...

88
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,544
Absolute evil"...
It's beginning to sound religious.

89
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:14,550
I don't go to a church...

90
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:17,823
But, it seems to me that
everything will be cleared up

91
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:19,656
if I see that person again.

92
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:23,558
You feel that you will regain
the memory you've lost...

93
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:24,965
Yes.

94
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,258
That's one means you may be
able to employ...

95
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:31,463
But I don't think you should let that
be a burden on you.

96
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:35,565
Thinking about your future
without stressing, is also important.

97
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,577
Yes...

98
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,191
Don't worry. Just work up a sweat
playing sports,

99
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:42,944
and your insecurities
should disappear.

100
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:52,183
Maurer, pull another all-nighter?

101
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:53,393
Yeah...

102
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:59,394
Oh, by the way, were you the one
who let that guy use the file room?

103
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,029
That guy...?

104
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:04,230
Yes. I asked him
what he was doing there

105
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:06,136
and he said
you had given him permission.

106
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:08,042
You mean he's still there?

107
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,242
Jeez!

108
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:15,516
Hey, you! It's about time you... Huh?!

109
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:19,847
Oh! Hey!

110
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:24,250
Are you all right? Hey! Huh?

111
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:35,462
Come on. Eat up.

112
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:37,471
Yes...

113
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:47,975
Good, isn't it?
I always have breakfast here.

114
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:51,877
Don't you go home?
What about your family?

115
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:55,678
Haven't got one.
My wife left me, you see.

116
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:56,790
Huh?

117
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,950
I was always so busy with work.

118
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:00,594
When I finally realized it,

119
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:03,289
my wife had gone back to her parents
with our daughter.

120
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,502
Have you ever thought about
bringing your wife home?

121
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,038
Why would I do that?

122
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:15,002
She's the one who walked out!
Why should I go to get her?

123
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:19,537
Well, you seem to regret
being so occupied with work.

124
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:22,006
Don't be silly!

125
00:09:22,383 --> 00:09:24,442
Work is most important to a man!

126
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:28,752
Any wife who cannot understand that
is welcome to leave me!

127
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,222
I'm sorry. It was none of my business.

128
00:09:31,592 --> 00:09:33,822
That's right.
It's none of your business.

129
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:36,562
Oh, uh... One more thing...

130
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:40,359
You smoke too much.
I say that as a doctor.

131
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,829
I told you it's none of your business!

132
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:44,971
Quit saying the same thing
my wife said!

133
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:49,071
Your wife was worried
about your health, too.

134
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:56,579
Mind your own business.

135
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,482
Nina's birthday present?

136
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:04,390
Yes. I finally finished it.

137
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:08,391
Her sweaters used to be
this tiny before.

138
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,598
Dear, are you really going to tell her
that she's not really our daughter?

139
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:17,570
Why can't we leave it...?

140
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:24,067
You're right...
There's no need to tell her that.

141
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:27,075
Nina is our daughter, after all.

142
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,017
I'm home!

143
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:32,408
Welcome home!

144
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,519
Boy...am I hungry!

145
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:41,895
Think about the future...?

146
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:44,897
Dr. Gaitel may be right.

147
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:07,879
"Tomorrow, your birthday, let's meet at
Heidelberg Castle at 7:00 PM."

148
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:12,549
Tomorrow...at Heidelberg Castle...?

149
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:22,893
I'm so busy, but here I am staring at
a mountain of papers with you!

150
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:25,772
Isn't it about time you gave up?

151
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:36,216
Listen, Doctor...

152
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:39,614
If...it's just a thought, now...

153
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:46,425
If I were to go to get my wife...
Do you think she'd come back?

154
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:49,789
Yes. If you quit smoking, that is.

155
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:55,802
Oh!

156
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:56,937
What is it?

157
00:11:57,972 --> 00:11:58,939
I found it!

158
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:00,440
Huh...?

159
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:02,669
11 -year-old boy disappears...

160
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:04,988
It is possible that he was kidnapped,

161
00:12:05,012 --> 00:12:08,892
but there has been no word
from a kidnapper.

162
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,441
16 Necker Street...

163
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:13,954
Someone named Fortner has filled out
a missing person's report!

164
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:19,054
The raw data should be
in here somewhere...

165
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:20,351
Oh, here it is!

166
00:12:23,097 --> 00:12:24,895
Huh...? Oh!

167
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:26,763
W-What is it?

168
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:29,412
You said that that killer would

169
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:32,599
come to take his sister away
when she turned 20, didn't you?

170
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,604
If the boy in this article
is her brother...

171
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:39,113
Look! His birth date is printed here.

172
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:43,879
Today is the 20th birthday
of those twins.

173
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,827
Uh, hello, Dad? It's me.
I just finished work.

174
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,128
I'm going to meet up with a friend
then I'll be coming home.

175
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:02,168
Yes... At Heidelberg Castle.

176
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:03,670
I see.

177
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:06,736
Your mom is making preparations
for a birthday party, you know.

178
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,836
Was that Nina?

179
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:13,773
Yes. She says she's going to meet
a friend before coming home.

180
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:15,974
I wonder who it is.

181
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:18,677
Nina's all grown up, after all.

182
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:24,383
<i>Maybe this will help me
to remember things...</i>

183
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:32,363
<i>I want to know who I really am.</i>

184
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:38,299
Doctor, what do you intend to do if
the twin girl is at the Fortners' home?

185
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,201
Whatever the case,
that family is in danger.

186
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,204
I will contact the police
and ask for protection.

187
00:13:46,313 --> 00:13:48,525
Do you think the police will
do anything just from your reasoning?

188
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:50,574
Nothing has happened yet.

189
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:52,679
It'll be too late
after something happens!

190
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,288
Nothing's going to happen.
It's all in your head!

191
00:13:58,258 --> 00:14:03,073
Listen, Doctor...
Of the four murder cases,

192
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:05,464
I myself went to
the crime scene in Cologne.

193
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,767
There was something different
about that scene.

194
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:14,470
I sensed no purpose,
no greed, no bitterness...

195
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,138
It was like someone simply ended
these people's lives.

196
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:22,182
I could tell just by looking
at the crime scene.

197
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:26,078
You said that a kid
who wasn't even 20, did it.

198
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:27,477
But do you think a youngster could

199
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:30,580
kill those people
without feeling any emotion?

200
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,953
That wasn't something done by a kid!

201
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:36,285
It was something bigger...

202
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,491
Bigger... What...?

203
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,761
That's just it...

204
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:44,270
I just can't find the right words
to describe this case.

205
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:55,712
If I have to describe it, it's trite,
but that was the Devil's work.

206
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:03,149
If that killer were to appear before me,
I would kill him without a pause.

207
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:13,656
16 Necker Street... We're here.

208
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:22,575
Good evening!
Sorry to call on you so late...

209
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:28,181
Yes?

210
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:36,783
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm Maurer of the Heidelberg Post.

211
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:39,190
What would a newspaper reporter
be wanting?

212
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:42,459
Uh...I'd like to ask you
some questions...

213
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,699
What is it?
- Oh...!

214
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:54,566
It's regarding this missing persons report
that you filed in 1936...

215
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:59,511
Y-You can forget about that matter!

216
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:05,541
Uh... Could you please talk to us?
Don't you have a girl living with you?

217
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:08,751
The twin sister of
the boy who disappeared...

218
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:13,325
Please! Please answer me.

219
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:16,620
Oh, dear...

220
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:17,730
Huh?

221
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:19,365
A cake...

222
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,231
They had a birthday cake prepared...

223
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:27,273
You took in a pair of twins
nine years ago, didn't you?

224
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:30,238
The girl still lives with you,
doesn't she?

225
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:31,669
Please leave!

226
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,374
We have raised her
as our true daughter.

227
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,477
Please don't make waves.

228
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,079
Please leave us alone.

229
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:44,386
You took in a pair of twins
nine years ago.

230
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:46,953
The boy had surgical scars
on his head

231
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:49,394
and the girl had amnesia.

232
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,797
Isn't that right?!

233
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:56,960
Mr. Fortner, you must contact
the police at once!

234
00:16:57,337 --> 00:17:00,034
Your lives, and your daughter's,
are in danger!

235
00:17:01,074 --> 00:17:02,041
Mr. Maurer...

236
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:09,909
W-What are you talking about?

237
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:12,650
Please let us see your daughter.

238
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:14,952
She is out at the moment.

239
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:17,824
Where is she?!

240
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:19,557
At Heidelberg Castle.

241
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,553
She said she was going
to meet a friend.

242
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:24,855
Please let me use your car!

243
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:27,929
W-Wait! We must
notify the police first.

244
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:31,169
We don't have the time
to explain things to the police!

245
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:32,572
Give me the key, quickly.

246
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:37,241
All right. I'll call them from here.

247
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:38,878
Thank you.

248
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:41,080
Hey, Doctor!

249
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:46,880
Be careful! As I said earlier,
he's a terrible person.

250
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:48,846
You'd better not die!

251
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:50,890
Mr. Maurer...

252
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:56,606
Come back alive...
Then I'll quit smoking.

253
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,496
I'll follow the quack's advice.

254
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:01,228
Your wife will be happy, too.

255
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,631
Now, how should I explain
this to the police...?

256
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,334
Our daughter... Is she all right?

257
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:11,344
What has happened?

258
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:14,540
Don't worry.
Let me use your phone.

259
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:17,113
What has happened to our daughter?

260
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:19,243
Please tell us!

261
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:20,851
Calm down!

262
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:22,221
Huh?

263
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,224
What in the...?!

264
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:31,961
The phone line's been cut...

265
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:49,080
Anna... Please be safe... Anna!

266
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:58,188
It's way past time...
I guess that message was a prank.

267
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:00,418
I'm going home.

268
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:03,388
You can't.

269
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:05,598
Huh?

270
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:19,042
You have to...wait here.

271
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:26,419
Who are you?

272
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:34,753
I was asked to make sure
you waited here.

273
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:41,832
I said to wait...
Don't you understand?

274
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:45,371
Wait!

275
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:49,171
You have to wait here!

276
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:51,373
That's what I was told!

277
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:53,880
Anna!

278
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,688
Anna... No, you're Nina Fortner,
aren't you?

279
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:08,993
Do you remember me?
I'm Dr. Tenma. I'm glad you're safe.

280
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:12,589
Anna... Dr. Tenma...

281
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:15,902
Let's go. You must go home.

282
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:19,095
Y-You... Are you...
my prince on a white horse?

283
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,406
Huh...?!

284
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:21,906
Who are you?

285
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:26,502
Don't butt in... Don't butt in, will you?

286
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:30,014
She's gotta wait here.

287
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:34,086
If she doesn't, I-I...

288
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:37,483
I won't get paid!

289
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,720
He said no one would come!

290
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:45,091
Damn...!

291
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:58,745
Are you all right?

292
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,380
I-I'm amazed...

293
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:03,345
I need something to tie him up with!

294
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:05,785
Oh...

295
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:10,383
Who asked you to do this?

296
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:12,453
I-I don't know.

297
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:14,691
When did he say he was coming here?

298
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:18,407
I don't know. He just said
he would come here

299
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,456
after doing something important.

300
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:24,363
Don't tell me...your home...

301
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:25,772
Huh?

302
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:30,068
I have to hurry back to your home!

303
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:31,304
W-What's going on?

304
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:34,506
I'll explain later!
We've got to hurry, Anna!

305
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:36,411
Anna...
-Hurry!

306
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:45,123
Damn... I can't get loose...

307
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,773
Please tell me! Who are you?
And I'm not Anna!

308
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:10,293
I'm Nina!

309
00:22:10,317 --> 00:22:15,153
No, when you were brought into
my hospital, you were Anna.

310
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:20,056
And your brother's name was Johan.

311
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:23,396
My brother...
