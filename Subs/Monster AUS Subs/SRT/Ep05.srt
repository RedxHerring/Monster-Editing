1
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:19,471
Now, class...
Tell me what the decision

2
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:23,910
in the 1963 Stuttgart case
was based upon.

3
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:30,482
Now, now, what is this silence...?
Is this a Zen temple in the Orient?

4
00:00:33,254 --> 00:00:36,622
Mr. Eimer... I would like to
hear your answer.

5
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:37,725
Huh?!

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,422
Well...uh... That is...

7
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:45,993
Anyone! Is there anyone
who will break this silence?

8
00:00:56,444 --> 00:01:01,177
So, the chronic latecomer is here at last.
You're 13 minutes late...

9
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:05,475
Seems your part-time pizza delivery job
was awfully busy today.

10
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,383
I'm sorry...Professor...Kronecker...

11
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:12,889
Now, then, let me ask you a question
before you sit down.

12
00:01:13,428 --> 00:01:15,954
Do you have enough strength
to tell me what the basis was

13
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,590
for the decision in the Stuttgart case?

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,564
Huh? Uh...yes. Well...

15
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:26,969
The accused claimed that
the kidnapping was a sham

16
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,602
and that the victim's death
had been due to an accident.

17
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:33,771
After an investigation
of the crime scene

18
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:37,910
it was found that the victim's death
had indeed been accidental.

19
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:42,433
And so, based on the fact that the intent
to kill must be proven in a murder

20
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:45,483
I believe that a sentence
of 15 years was handed down.

21
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:54,101
Very good.
Sit down, Nina Fortner.

22
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:57,734
Yes, Professor!

23
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:32,295
You saved us, Nina.

24
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,694
If no one had been able to
give him the answer,

25
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:38,796
Kronecker would have probably
demanded 50-page reports.

26
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,104
50 pages, if we were lucky.

27
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,104
I have to treat Nina, to whom we're
greatly indebted, to something to eat.

28
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:47,272
You can come, can't you Nina?
Just the two of us...

29
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm sorry, Peter.
I have a club meeting today.

30
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:52,519
See you!

31
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,319
She turned you down again...

32
00:03:57,258 --> 00:03:58,783
Peter, how many times was that?

33
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,054
Shut up! I'd like to see if there's anyone
who can get Nina to agree to a date.

34
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:15,533
I-I give up...!

35
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:22,882
Oh, no! If I'm late with my deliveries,

36
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:24,577
I'm going to get it
from the manager again!

37
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:42,296
I'm home...!
Boy, am I hungry!

38
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:44,599
Oh, my, the neighbors
can probably hear you.

39
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:46,298
You're a young lady now.
It's not becoming.

40
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,006
Go and wash your hands.

41
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:49,610
Yes, ma'am!

42
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:53,879
Oh! Mom, did you
color your hair?

43
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:55,272
It looks good, doesn't it?

44
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,518
Honestly! You shouldn't be dying
your hair so bright, at your age!

45
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:02,356
You're wrong, Dad.
She looks lovely.

46
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,118
She's not going to
a masquerade party, after all.

47
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:08,056
Wouldn't it be wonderful
for Mom to be young forever?

48
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:09,530
Hi, Dad...

49
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,533
Oh, yes... Speaking of masquerades...

50
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:17,232
I saw some kids in costumes today.

51
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:21,173
Oh, yes...
It's the St. Hadrian Costume Parade.

52
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,675
I wish I had dressed up like that
when I was little. They were so cute!

53
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:31,483
Huh? Oh...you did dress up
in a costume.

54
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,150
Isn't that right, dear?

55
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:35,785
O-Oh...that's right.

56
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:37,090
Huh?

57
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:39,692
Let's see... It's around here...

58
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:43,492
Oh, here it is!
Here, look at this!

59
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:49,703
It's true...

60
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:53,063
You were so excited
and made such a fuss.

61
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:54,308
Isn't that right, dear?

62
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:56,704
Huh? Oh, that's right.

63
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:13,124
A costume parade...?

64
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:18,966
Distant spring.

65
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:23,170
I forlornly wait for a spring
that will never come... Hannah.

66
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:26,966
Oh, Hannah... Will you hurry
and get over your broken heart?!

67
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:30,444
Huh?!

68
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:35,342
Let me send you
the world's most beautiful flower.

69
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:39,385
I was born to blanket you in flowers...

70
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:44,258
Wow... I wonder who sent this.

71
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:49,286
Aha...!
I'm very impressed, Peter!

72
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:52,798
How have you been, Nina?

73
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,295
Yes, well, I've been very well,
thankfully, Dr. Gaitel.

74
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:58,064
That's good.

75
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:01,151
Of course, I could tell by the look
on your face when you entered

76
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,735
this counseling room
that your were doing well.

77
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:07,843
And do you no longer
have that dream?

78
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:10,942
Of that monster appearing
out of the darkness...

79
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:16,047
Yes! I've been sleeping so well,
I have no time to dream.

80
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:20,159
I wonder why I was plagued by
such a dream night after night.

81
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:23,528
It's common for people to become
insecure during their student years.

82
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:28,063
Dreams of the future become
confused with other insecurities,

83
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,570
and you lose sight of who you are.

84
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:34,069
But what you are is something
you can spend your whole life

85
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:36,075
trying to learn, and never discover.

86
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:39,790
All you can do now is be prepared
to spend your whole life searching,

87
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:43,682
and do only what you can do
toward your future.

88
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,582
Yes. I will do my best.
I want to become a public prosecutor.

89
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:52,389
That's good. All right, I think we can
end our counseling session for today.

90
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,291
Thank you very much.

91
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:04,905
Nina Fortner... Such a cheerful girl...

92
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:08,602
But I can't help but feel
that her cheerfulness

93
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:10,701
is a reaction to something
she's running away from.

94
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,044
Some...vast...darkness...

95
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:17,661
What?

96
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:20,848
Don't say that.
Don't act so innocent.

97
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:23,223
What in the world
are you talking about?

98
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:26,051
I was born to
blanket you in flowers..."

99
00:08:27,094 --> 00:08:30,530
I never thought you had
the makings of a poet.

100
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:32,358
I don't know anything about that.

101
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:37,165
I wouldn't be able to come up with words
like those even if I stood on my head.

102
00:08:37,605 --> 00:08:39,630
Huh? Then, who was it?

103
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:43,241
I've given my email address
to only my friends.

104
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:44,678
Who knows?

105
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:49,672
Damn. All I know is that
I have another rival in love!

106
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,586
Who in the world could it be...?

107
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:01,318
This bizarre murder
that took place in Munich...

108
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:06,825
The perpetrator,
after shooting the parents to death,

109
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:09,028
strangled the two children with a rope.

110
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:16,001
Now, I'd like you to explain the ruling
of the judge from the court records...

111
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:18,145
Nina Fortner.

112
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,248
Huh?

113
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:24,049
Do you not understand the question?

114
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:26,652
N-No...uh...

115
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:31,654
The trial was focused on
the cold-blooded murder

116
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,955
of a whole family...

117
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:36,764
Huh...?
- The evidence...

118
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:39,524
The evidence...

119
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:44,169
Oh...? There are times
you can't answer either, Nina?

120
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,080
Nina!

121
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:55,075
What's wrong, Nina?

122
00:09:58,319 --> 00:09:59,286
Nina!?

123
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:02,983
Are you all right?
You want to go to the infirmary?

124
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:07,893
I-I'm all right.
I just felt a little ill...

125
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:11,788
After listening to the professor's story...
suddenly...

126
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:15,296
Huh? You mean that bizarre
massacre of that family?

127
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:16,470
Stop it!

128
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:21,074
Is that it?

129
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:23,520
I thought you were awfully brave,

130
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:24,978
but you're more sensitive
than I expected.

131
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,910
Did you see a horror movie
that terrified you as a child?

132
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:32,976
I know! I'll bet that counselor,
Dr. Gaitel, would probably say...

133
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:34,731
If you look back on
why this happened,

134
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:36,223
you'll find it was nothing significant.

135
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:39,820
Now, why don't you think back
on your childhood..."

136
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:44,397
I don't remember...

137
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:45,832
Huh?

138
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,132
I don't remember anything
before the age of ten...

139
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:14,992
My memories...
My childhood memories...

140
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,697
Huh?!

141
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,008
Yes...

142
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:33,308
They were a very nice couple...
To think they were killed like that...

143
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:35,379
Huh? Children?

144
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,918
Oh, now that you mention it,
they had a son.

145
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:44,222
His name was Michael, I think.
They lived together about two years.

146
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,486
A boy? Was there a boy...?

147
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:50,023
Yes, there was.

148
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:53,331
Wasn't his name Michael?
He was around fourteen.

149
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:57,436
Michael, you say...?
I seem to remember him.

150
00:11:57,972 --> 00:12:00,737
Why? Are you the police?

151
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:07,077
Yes. Michael Reichmann.
He was a student in my class.

152
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:10,973
But he didn't leave
much of an impression.

153
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:14,877
I'm embarrassed to say this,
but I don't remember him well.

154
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:20,689
I'm not sure if he had any friends.
And, there are no records...

155
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:24,356
Everything burned
in a fire six years ago.

156
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:32,115
<i>There definitely was a boy
named Michael living here</i>

157
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:34,005
<i>in Cologne until six years ago...</i>

158
00:12:35,142 --> 00:12:38,009
<i>And.. .Michael's real name...</i>

159
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:43,383
<i>Johan... I've used that name before...</i>

160
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:47,182
<i>Who. .. are you...?</i>

161
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:52,725
<i>But what's the use in knowing that?
What's the use?</i>

162
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:57,730
<i>He is a serial-killer who is a twin...
That's all there is.</i>

163
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,428
<i>What am I doing...?</i>

164
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:11,573
<i>A twin! What about his sister?
Where did his twin sister go?!</i>

165
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,638
"I will come for you soon..."

166
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,383
Who is this...?

167
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:20,244
You'll come for me soon...?
What does that mean?

168
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:32,962
A child...? Yes, there was...
about 7 or 3 years ago.

169
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:37,002
So Mr. and Mrs. Heinemann,
who were killed, were fostering a boy?

170
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:38,505
What was he like?

171
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,502
What was he like...?

172
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,767
That was a long time ago.

173
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:46,406
And he only lived with them
about a year.

174
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:49,309
I don't remember
anything about him.

175
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,080
Didn't that boy have a sister?

176
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:53,816
It was only that boy.

177
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:57,317
Listen, I just want to forget about
what happened to that couple.

178
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,450
I even thought about moving away
after it happened.

179
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:11,066
I know about that boy.

180
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:16,670
Come on in. I was just about to
fix some tea.

181
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,078
Have a seat.

182
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:30,055
Uh...yes. Thank you.
Uh...I...

183
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:31,585
Have a seat.

184
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:54,305
Please have some tea.

185
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:01,654
Thank you very much.

186
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:10,521
You're a doctor, aren't you?

187
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:16,359
That boy told me.
You're Dr. Tenma, aren't you?

188
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:20,766
He's coming for you?

189
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:21,941
Who?

190
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,339
I have no idea.
It was an anonymous message.

191
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:28,238
You look so happy.

192
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:30,994
You're not thinking a prince
on a white horse

193
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,783
will be coming for you, are you?

194
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:35,989
Are you jealous?

195
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,686
There you go,
daydreaming again, Nina.

196
00:15:39,526 --> 00:15:42,496
"I was born to blanket you in flowers..."

197
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,295
There aren't any kids
who talk like that today.

198
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:47,700
Oh!

199
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:52,568
Say, listen. Haven't you noticed
a strange boy in class recently?

200
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:54,173
Oh! Yes, I have!

201
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:57,469
The one who calmly sits in
that "legendary seat" in Room 12,

202
00:15:57,544 --> 00:16:00,036
where you're bound to be called on
by the teacher.

203
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:02,743
And yet, he's never called on.

204
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,649
That's right. And do you know,
he stares at Nina all through class!

205
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:09,652
Huh?
- He's the one!

206
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:11,024
What...?

207
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,569
You know...!

208
00:16:12,593 --> 00:16:13,958
Your prince on the white horse!

209
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:22,959
That boy was extremely grateful
to you, Dr. Tenma.

210
00:16:23,904 --> 00:16:25,882
He said you were the one
who saved him;

211
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:28,170
you meant more to him than a parent.

212
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:30,475
What name did he go by?

213
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:35,042
Franz... But he said
it wasn't his real name.

214
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:40,084
He trusted you enough
to tell you that?

215
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,360
That Franz, who had shown up
out of the blue,

216
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:50,090
was cared for by
Mr. and Mrs. Heinemann,

217
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:52,359
who lived in the flat across the hall,
for a year.

218
00:16:53,834 --> 00:17:01,834
No, actually, it was 14 months
from March 1937 to April 1933.

219
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:06,639
Then, one day, he suddenly vanished.

220
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:12,247
He was very bright.
And he was well-mannered.

221
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:15,045
Did he used to
come to this apartment?

222
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:20,426
Every day. I lived alone
so I always welcomed him.

223
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:25,057
He sat in that seat
and spent his time studying.

224
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:28,678
In no time, he had mastered

225
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:30,932
the English and French
that I taught him.

226
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:36,072
By the time he disappeared,
he was fluent in both.

227
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,344
That 12-year-old boy...

228
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:43,978
Is there anything else
you remember about him?

229
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:47,886
He always listened closely
to my stories.

230
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:52,590
What stories do you think
he was most interested in?

231
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:54,294
Well...

232
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:56,594
War stories.

233
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,797
War...?

234
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:00,944
During World War II,

235
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:03,027
I was on the crew of a U-boat.

236
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,205
His favorite story
was about the time

237
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:10,232
we were attacked by a destroyer
of the Allied Forces...

238
00:18:10,877 --> 00:18:12,743
We were at a depth of 120 meters...

239
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,458
We were attacked by the enemy

240
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:18,918
and although we had suffered
a fatal blow, we kept going.

241
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:24,117
Inside that groaning ship,
we all waited in terror.

242
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:30,958
We returned from that living hell
33 hours later.

243
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:33,664
An ordinary child would probably

244
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:36,759
look at this as
another adventure story...

245
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:38,929
But that boy was different.

246
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:42,139
What he was
most interested in was...

247
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,336
the terror.

248
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,272
Extreme terror.

249
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:51,373
What is the reaction of a person
standing on the edge of death?

250
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:53,943
That was his only interest.

251
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:56,889
He took pleasure in terror!

252
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:04,741
Wh-What sort of expression

253
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:06,324
did he have while
listening to your stories?

254
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:11,304
Probably had a gleam in his eye,
and a smile on his face.

255
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:13,039
Probably?

256
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,631
I am blind, you see.

257
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:23,442
Yes. I know neither his real name,
nor what he looks like.

258
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:29,721
Earlier, you said that boy
trusted me, didn't you?

259
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:33,353
He never trusts anybody.

260
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,023
There's only one person
he's ever trusted--his sister.

261
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,662
I-I'm looking for that sister!!

262
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:46,566
He said he would go and collect her
when she turned twenty.

263
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:47,774
Go where?

264
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,271
To Heidelberg.

265
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:54,580
See you later!

266
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:57,994
Ride carefully on your scooter.

267
00:19:58,018 --> 00:19:58,985
I will!

268
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,481
Bye, Dad!

269
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:03,690
Be careful.

270
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:08,758
Good bye!

271
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:18,195
I guess it's time...

272
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:20,106
But...

273
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:21,504
We decided, didn't we?

274
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:28,214
That we'd tell her on her 20th birthday
that she's not our child.

275
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:38,691
Hey, wait, I can't...

276
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,091
What are you saying?
You wanted to meet him.

277
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:44,289
We told him you'd wait for him here.

278
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:47,092
Don't screw up,
with your "prince on a white horse."

279
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:48,334
See you later!

280
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,237
Oh... Ciara! Beata!

281
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:57,539
How could they do this
behind my back...!

282
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:04,541
Oh, look!

283
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:05,685
He's here!

284
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:20,790
H-How do you do...
You're Nina Fortner?

285
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:22,260
Y-Yes...

286
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:26,301
Uh...I'm Otto Hubermann...

287
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:29,808
Oh, hello...

288
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:49,495
<i>Who is he...?</i>

289
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:52,231
<i>Who is he?</i>

290
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:57,728
<i>I've seen him... somewhere. ..before...</i>

291
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:10,545
<i>Who are you...?</i>

292
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:26,365
Huh? Huh...?

293
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:27,762
Nina!
- Nina!

294
00:22:28,335 --> 00:22:30,112
Nina! What's wrong?
Are you all right?

295
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:31,814
Nina, wake up!
- Nina! Nina!?

296
00:22:31,838 --> 00:22:33,272
Nina, wake up!
- Nina!

297
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,569
Hey, Nina!
- Hey, Nina!

298
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:35,802
Nina, are you all right?!
