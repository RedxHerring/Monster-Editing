1
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:25,974
Doppel Ranger Kick!

2
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:32,897
Hey, that's not fair!

3
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:34,446
I kicked you! Fall over!

4
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:38,854
My evil empire is planning to
take over the world.

5
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:41,021
We won't be defeated that easily!

6
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:45,833
In the TV show, we always
defeat you at the end!

7
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:50,729
Are your plans for world domination
going well?

8
00:00:51,105 --> 00:00:52,072
Oh, Johan!

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,665
He's not falling over at all!

10
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:59,503
Things will be rough after you
take over the world.

11
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:02,548
What kind of world are you
going to make?

12
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:06,749
I don't care.
I'm finished after I mess it up!

13
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:11,147
What?! It sounds like more fun
to mess it up.

14
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:14,885
I'll quit the Rainbow Rangers
and join the evil organization!

15
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:21,634
Now then, shall we start
heading back?

16
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:23,304
Okay.

17
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:25,703
All right, let's all head back.
Don't forget anything.

18
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,189
It's getting a bit warmer, isn't it?

19
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:28,621
Yeah.

20
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:32,924
Did Rosemary catch a cold
this past winter?

21
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:37,233
Yes. She was running around
outside with her friends.

22
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:40,837
She gets a terrible fever every year.

23
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,777
Yeah, it was around this time.

24
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:47,475
We had to rush to the doctor
in the middle of the night.

25
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:53,146
Do you always carry around
pictures of her?

26
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:56,257
Yeah. She's probably gotten big.

27
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,752
She's growing, so her face

28
00:03:58,826 --> 00:04:00,954
has probably changed
during the time we've been apart.

29
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:07,900
But I know that I'll be able to
recognize Rosemary,

30
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:09,664
no matter how big she gets.

31
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:12,873
Oh yeah.

32
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,970
Show her this when
you think it's appropriate.

33
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:22,447
They're newspaper clippings
and a copy of the report

34
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:25,043
from when I shot
that young serial killer.

35
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:33,457
I'm not going to ask you to explain.

36
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:38,864
The truth is that I killed someone.
I'm not justifying my actions.

37
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:44,036
It's just that I want her
to know the truth.

38
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,175
I understand.

39
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:56,344
When...can I meet her?

40
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,155
I'll ask her once more
if she wants to meet her father.

41
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:09,825
I-I see ! I'll be waiting for a call !
I return home every night at 9:00!

42
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:13,126
Richard, you're back
to your old self again.

43
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:14,794
Huh?

44
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:19,735
You have the same look in your eyes
as when you were younger...

45
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:23,539
When you first became
a detective... When we first met.

46
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,383
I see.

47
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,584
What do you think? You'll get a bonus
if you sign up now.

48
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:41,228
Well, we already have insurance.

49
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:43,759
Just listen to what I have
to offer, Mr. Liebert.

50
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:46,489
The insurance I have right now
is enough.

51
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:49,937
I can't afford another policy.

52
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:54,369
We bought a policy four years ago
when we moved in.

53
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:55,701
Four years ago?

54
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:57,110
Where were you living before then?

55
00:05:57,812 --> 00:06:00,144
In Bruntál, near Mannheim.

56
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:05,676
Bruntál, huh? That's a nice place.
Are you from there?

57
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,250
Yes. We lived there
before coming here.

58
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:10,851
By the way, ma'am,
do you have any children?

59
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:14,489
Yes, our son is currently attending
the University of Munich.

60
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:15,926
A college student!

61
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:19,595
In that case, I have a policy
that's perfect for young people.

62
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:21,230
Just hear me out!

63
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:22,095
Huh?

64
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:23,604
Oh.

65
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:25,998
Is this your son?

66
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:29,570
He was very cute. What's his name?

67
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:32,412
It's Johan. Would you like some tea?

68
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:34,713
Oh. ..you don't have to.
Don't mind me.

69
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,877
He only calls once in a while
now that he attends the university.

70
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:41,946
That's how boys are.

71
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:43,913
Boring, isn't it?

72
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:58,798
I'm back, Dr. Reichwein.

73
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:01,473
Yes, to Johan's home.

74
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:08,013
Yes. Well, they were
a pretty ordinary family.

75
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,043
So what do you think, Richard?

76
00:07:11,585 --> 00:07:15,146
Well, my experience
as a police detective tells me that

77
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:19,352
the more ordinary something is,
the more suspicious I should be.

78
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,827
I see.

79
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:24,397
Anyway, I'm going to do more
research on Johan's acquaintances.

80
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,932
Something...
There's got to be something.

81
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:36,366
Johan's prep school report
describes him as

82
00:07:36,444 --> 00:07:40,005
a well-behaved student
with good grades.

83
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:17,194
<i>But I know that I'll be
able to recognize Rosemary,</i>

84
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:19,687
<i>no matter how big she gets.</i>

85
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:35,930
<i>That baby's face... It couldn't have
grown up to become Johan!</i>

86
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:42,804
Here. This is the birth certificate.

87
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,077
Oh...thank you.

88
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:53,754
<i>Johan Wilhelm Liebert...
Born February 9, 1976...</i>

89
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:57,984
<i>He was definitely born in this town.</i>

90
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:01,886
<i>Nothing... out of the ordinary.</i>

91
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:05,632
Mr. Hertz!

92
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:06,993
Huh?

93
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:09,100
How many times must I tell you?!

94
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:10,534
No smoking in this office!

95
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:13,637
Don't be so stiff. Get me an ashtray.

96
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:14,674
No!

97
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:17,073
There was a fire here
four years ago, remember?

98
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:18,407
We've had such a terrible time
since then.

99
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,878
All of our documents were destroyed.

100
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:23,045
Did you redo all the documents?

101
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:24,795
Y-Yes.

102
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:27,379
We had to have people give us
their information to redo everything.

103
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:32,023
It's a small town, so we were able to
get everything back to normal.

104
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:43,194
Hey, thanks for coming, Dr. Gillen.

105
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,472
It's been a while, Dr. Reichwein.

106
00:09:54,482 --> 00:09:56,883
Dr. Tenma appeared before you

107
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:59,352
and said that he was looking
for a man named "Johan"?

108
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,447
Yes. He didn't have any grounds
for anything he said.

109
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:07,122
But if this person is the "friend"

110
00:10:07,194 --> 00:10:13,156
who incited Peter Jurgens,
the serial killer I'm researching,

111
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:15,896
we'll be able to find a clue
to all these cases.

112
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:18,868
Take care of it, Dr. Gillen.

113
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,366
Yes. I'll get permission to interview
Jurgens as soon as possible.

114
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:26,977
We'll be able to prove
Dr. Tenma's innocence

115
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:29,675
based on his reaction
to this photograph.

116
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,724
He's dead?

117
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:25,571
Yes. The real Johan Liebert,
who was born in Bruntál,

118
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,765
died when he was two years old.

119
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:29,308
Does that mean that the Lieberts

120
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:34,007
used the fact that the office's records
had been destroyed

121
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:37,312
to pretend that their son
was still alive?

122
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:38,377
Probably.

123
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:39,378
Then...

124
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:43,652
The Johan Liebert
who exists right now...

125
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:46,523
Who in the world...is he?

126
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:54,327
At any rate. .. As I told you, I've given
Dr. Gillen a photo of Johan.

127
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:58,067
Let's hope to get an answer from him.

128
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,538
How about some dinner?

129
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:03,543
No, I've got to get back.

130
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:07,676
What? Going back to work
after running around all day?

131
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,680
Well, I might get a phone call.

132
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:14,850
I may be able to meet my daughter.

133
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:16,489
Oh?

134
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:21,622
It's all right. What's important is that
I move forward...right?

135
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:26,630
All right! You've completely recovered!

136
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:38,069
Yes?! Hello?!

137
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:43,974
<i>Dad? It's me.</i>

138
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,457
Rosemary...

139
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:58,390
Yeah, I'm doing fine. Yes... Yeah
Of course I can see you.

140
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:02,762
I can see you.. .at any time.

141
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:07,674
Mr. Richard...

142
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:09,042
It's Johan.

143
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:14,740
This boy. Jurgens...

144
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:16,513
Have you seen him before?

145
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:20,381
Have you met him before?

146
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:25,316
I don't know him.

147
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:32,491
You said that your friend Johan
only sent you letters.

148
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,364
That you'd never met.

149
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:39,772
But Johan knew a lot about you.

150
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,308
Could I borrow your pen?

151
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:50,214
Huh? Sorry, but I'm not allowed
to give things to you.

152
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:51,551
Lend me the pen.

153
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:09,969
The park.

154
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:11,397
Huh?

155
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:15,369
The park. It was the day
after I had killed someone.

156
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:20,941
I was thinking, "I'm going to quit.
This is going to be the last time."

157
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:22,382
I went to the park.

158
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:26,186
He was with a lot of children.

159
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:30,921
Hold on a second.
I forgot to rewind the tape!

160
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:32,417
Start over from the beginning.

161
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:33,919
"Come with us."

162
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:35,221
Huh?

163
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,459
"Come with us."

164
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,560
"Come with us."

165
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:41,796
"Come with us."

166
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,295
"Come with us."

167
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:46,673
"Come..."

168
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,950
W-What do you want?!

169
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:05,453
We met at Mr. Schuwald's place.

170
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:12,398
I'm Johan Liebert. I called you
several times and you didn't answer,

171
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:13,797
so I came to see you in person.

172
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:26,309
Yes? Ah, Dr. Gillen.
How was it?

173
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:28,707
What happened when
you showed Jurgens the photo?

174
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,887
He's dead?

175
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:36,547
Yes. Just now in the hospital.

176
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:40,292
The police are questioning me
right now, so I can't go anywhere.

177
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:42,525
Our key witness is dead

178
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:46,032
because I was careless enough
to give him a pen.

179
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:51,033
But, Dr. Reichwein, his suicide

180
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:52,833
was clearly a response
to Johan's photograph!

181
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:57,968
<i>I'll come over after
they're finished questioning me.</i>

182
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:01,278
All right!
I'll contact Richard immediately.

183
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:07,454
Richard...

184
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:17,589
A college paper?

185
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:22,467
Yes. I'm researching the Convention
on the Rights of the Child,

186
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:25,130
which was formed in 1989 by the U.N.

187
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,299
Would you like something to drink,
Mr. Richard?

188
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:29,599
I'm fine.

189
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:33,169
You quit drinking, didn't you?

190
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:36,282
That's right.

191
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:42,184
You were drunk
and executed that boy.

192
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,457
Am I right?

193
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:50,759
Y-Yeah. I was drunk,
and I did something unforgivable.

194
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:54,131
I want to know something
related to that.

195
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:59,732
The boy you killed. ..
Stephan Yoss, age seventeen.

196
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:02,368
What crime did he commit?

197
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:08,638
Boy, huh? A seventeen-year-old boy
committed those demonic crimes.

198
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:12,080
Nine counts of rape and murder,
two counts of attempted murder.

199
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,884
Is that why you executed him?

200
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:14,954
It wasn't an execution!

201
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:20,151
Oh. ..sorry. By the way,
you are aware that Article 40

202
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:22,821
of the Convention on the Rights
of the Child states that every child is

203
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:26,355
"to be presumed innocent until proven
guilty according to law"' aren't you?

204
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:30,896
Yeah, I know. I was once
in the juvenile department.

205
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:31,597
I see.

206
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,202
So what about Article 37?

207
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:37,104
"Neither capital punishment
nor life imprisonment"

208
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:39,669
"without possibility of release
shall be imposed for of fences"

209
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:41,771
"committed by persons
below eighteen years of age."

210
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:47,386
Most of the convention concerns
basic human rights,

211
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:49,683
which are given to people
of this country regardless of age.

212
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,755
I did not set out to execute him!
It was a drunken mistake.

213
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:57,088
I know it is something
I cannot take back.

214
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,463
I've accepted
society's judgment and...

215
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,501
Now, now, just hold on a second.

216
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:06,168
I wanted to meet you
in order to write my paper.

217
00:18:08,342 --> 00:18:10,470
I'm sorry if I upset you.

218
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:13,609
Shall we take a walk
for a change of pace?

219
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,078
I'd like this whiskey.

220
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,087
The night air is still chilly.

221
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:26,789
Ah, Dr. Gillen, I still haven't
been able to contact Richard.

222
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:30,459
He said that he might be
able to see his daughter.

223
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:33,799
I don't think he'd be meeting her
this late at night.

224
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:38,469
Anyway, when you get a hold of him,
tell him to move with caution.

225
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:41,172
I'm heading over right now.

226
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:46,378
Stephan Yoss's history. ..
Do you know about it?

227
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:49,742
I believe. ..he was in an orphanage
in East Germany when he was young,

228
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:50,806
or something like that.

229
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:53,386
You need to know more.

230
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:58,189
That's the most important thing
when talking about him.

231
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:03,092
The orphanage he was in.. .
It was a horrible place.

232
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:10,230
He was a good kid.
But horrible things happened to him.

233
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:14,837
The way his mind was warped there.

234
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:18,205
Convention on the Rights of the Child,
Article 6.

235
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:21,771
Rights to life, and assurance
of survival and development.

236
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,942
Article 8. Preservation of identity.

237
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:28,047
Article 19. Protection from abuse.

238
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:32,120
Yes. It was a demonic place

239
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:33,990
where no one was concerned
with such things.

240
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:37,859
The place was called 511 Kinderheim.

241
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:41,261
Will you be able to see your
daughter?

242
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:44,300
W-Why...

243
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,162
How do you know about her?!

244
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:50,338
Was that your daughter calling you
at your house?

245
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:52,635
Will you be able to see her?

246
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:54,280
Maybe tomorrow?

247
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,951
What's. ..your motive?

248
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:06,683
To write a paper.

249
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,827
Not that!

250
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:11,558
What's your motive for staying
at Schuwald's place?!

251
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:18,371
Who... Who...are you?!

252
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:30,911
You said that you were drunk
when you shot that boy.

253
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:32,986
Answer my question first!

254
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:40,083
On that day, you were seen drinking
at a bar after you had killed the boy.

255
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:43,760
But isn't that strange?

256
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:46,623
As far as I can determine,

257
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:52,764
there isn't a single person who saw
you drinking before you killed that boy.

258
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:59,711
You weren't drunk
when you shot that boy, were you?

259
00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:00,839
What?

260
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,310
You were sober. You were calm.

261
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:10,246
You calmly pulled that trigger
in order to execute him.

262
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,718
Am I right?

263
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:16,021
No!

264
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:19,331
Why are you trying to forget?

265
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:23,060
Or are you lying?

266
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:28,570
Are you lying to other people?
Or to yourself?

267
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:32,477
Were you certain that
he committed his crimes?

268
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:35,339
Did you have the right to execute
him?

269
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,778
Do you think that by lying,
your sins will go away?

270
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,792
What a serious crime.

271
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,757
Can someone who's done
such a serious crime

272
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:57,236
really face his daughter
and act as if he's been rehabilitated?

273
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:10,616
How about it?

274
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:12,175
Want a drink?

275
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,392
Gillen? Is that Dr. Gillen?

276
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:24,931
It's the police.

277
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:29,001
Your patient, Richard Braun...is dead.
