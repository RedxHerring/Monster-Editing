1
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:11,158
Come on, get out of the way!

2
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,727
Don't interfere with the investigation.

3
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:18,568
At least tell us what you
think of the case.

4
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:22,232
Do you think that this incident
is one of the serial murders?

5
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:25,469
The victims, the Joppes,
did they have any children?

6
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:27,481
No matter how I think about it,

7
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,881
this is exactly like the murders
of middle-aged couples

8
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:31,885
that have been happening
throughout Germany!

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,746
No comment!

10
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:36,683
I've heard that an agent from the BKA

11
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:38,692
who's in charge of that case
has come.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,728
Does that mean that there's
a connection to the serial killings?

13
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:41,990
No comment!

14
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:49,727
It looks like it would be quicker
to ask the BKA agent directly.

15
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:52,470
Leave it to me!

16
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,510
I'll get ahead of the other papers!

17
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,006
Leave me a giant space
for the headline.

18
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:01,582
Take care of it!

19
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:04,685
Excuse me.

20
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:07,946
I'm Kipper from the Hamburg Tag.

21
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:14,257
You're the agent from the BKA,
aren't you? I'd like a comment.

22
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:16,255
Is there a connection between

23
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:18,857
this case and the other murders
of middle-aged couples?

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,034
Kipper of the Hamburg Tag...

25
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:24,101
I'll give you an exclusive.

26
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:27,468
That's precisely correct!

27
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:31,540
This case is one of the murders
of middle-aged couples!

28
00:01:31,913 --> 00:01:35,008
I thought so! Then the suspect is
that Japanese doctor!

29
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:39,783
I just saw the report. It was carried out
in the same way as the other killings.

30
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:41,449
That's quite the scoop.

31
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:43,917
Thanks.

32
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:44,959
Hold on a second.

33
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:45,785
Yes?

34
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,360
The Hamburg Tag is the leading
paper around here, isn't it?

35
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:54,525
I expect your article to be in
the leading papers across Germany.

36
00:01:55,236 --> 00:01:58,171
Of course. Thank you
for your cooperation.

37
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,798
I am the culprit.

38
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:46,646
I am the culprit.
I have just become the culprit.

39
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:48,712
Should I knock?

40
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,182
Ah, it would be best not to
startle the Joppes.

41
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,293
They're a friendly couple.

42
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:04,024
They casually welcome me in
and lead me to the living room.

43
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:06,999
They aren't suspicious of me.

44
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,269
The husband's chair...

45
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:18,776
Of course, I sit in the guest chair.

46
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,182
The husband dies over there
on the floor a few minutes later.

47
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:32,253
But I still haven't made my move.
Where is the wife?

48
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,161
That's right, she still isn't in this room.

49
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,026
She should be pouring out tea
in the kitchen.

50
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:43,663
The wife is stabbed in the back
before she can serve it.

51
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:48,908
Which means that I should
make my move about now.

52
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:51,809
I take out my knife.

53
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:55,012
As the husband panics
and tries to stand up,

54
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:56,049
I stab him!

55
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:58,185
Whoops. I missed.

56
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,946
The husband runs away
with a wound on his left hand.

57
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:05,054
The next strike is on
the husband's right shoulder.

58
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:09,293
I miss again. I'm really an amateur!

59
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:12,193
The husband screams
his wife's name.

60
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,996
But his wife, who's in the kitchen,
cannot hear him.

61
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:17,971
His wife has become
hard of hearing lately.

62
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:20,932
That's right. I knew about that.

63
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:22,701
Make noise. Cry and scream!

64
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:25,507
I can take my time and deal with
your wife after I kill you.

65
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,047
I've cornered you!

66
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,276
The husband's left hand print.

67
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:33,846
I've cornered the husband
in front of this sideboard.

68
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:35,656
The final blow!

69
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:41,461
No, I don't finish him off here either.

70
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,557
It's 5 meters from where
the husband died.

71
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,093
Why?

72
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,767
Why don't I finish him off here?

73
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:51,531
Why?

74
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:01,641
Did...

75
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:04,947
Did this man kill the Joppes?

76
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:08,248
No, that may not be the case.

77
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,821
I just want to ask a favor
of everyone in the neighborhood.

78
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:16,024
Behave normally if this man appears.

79
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,058
And give me a call
as soon as possible.

80
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:21,102
That's all.

81
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:22,870
Okay.

82
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:24,467
You won't be in any danger.

83
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:26,273
I guarantee it.

84
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:32,636
This was such a terrible incident
for such a quiet neighborhood.

85
00:06:33,347 --> 00:06:37,284
Indeed. The Joppes were
really good people.

86
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:41,085
Mrs. Joppe always greeted me
cheerfully every morning

87
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:42,280
when I called out to her.

88
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:44,154
When you called out to her?

89
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:49,390
Mrs. Joppe became hard of hearing
about a year ago.

90
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:51,565
Huh?! It can't be.

91
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,395
It was written on
her physician's medical chart.

92
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:58,300
She shouldn't have heard
most of your greetings.

93
00:06:58,806 --> 00:06:59,432
Oh my.

94
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:05,305
Knowing her, she probably greeted
me when she sensed my presence.

95
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:10,072
Didn't anyone in the neighborhood
know about her hearing?

96
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:12,445
No. I don't think so...

97
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:16,786
Well... What a wonderful business
you have.

98
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:19,992
You've made such rapid progress
at such a young age.

99
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:23,424
It's not an easy thing to do, Mr.
Giebel.

100
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:25,329
No, the contracts I made

101
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,699
with car manufacturers
just happened to work out.

102
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:34,907
I'd like to give my sincere condolences
for your uncle and aunt's misfortune.

103
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:40,344
Yes. My uncle and aunt
were my only relatives.

104
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:43,511
That couple never had any children.

105
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:47,049
They must have taken good care
of you as their nephew.

106
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,279
Yes. It was if I was really their son.

107
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:52,592
So, will the culprit be caught?

108
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,628
Yes. I'm pretty sure I know who it is.

109
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,524
Is it that Japanese ex-doctor?

110
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,692
You're familiar.

111
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:04,860
Of course. There have been cases
like this before.

112
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,069
How much will your inheritance be?

113
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:10,169
Huh?

114
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:14,314
Well, Mr. Joppe was
quite a wealthy man.

115
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:18,478
Does that have something to do
with this case?

116
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,049
You are the only heir to their estate.

117
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,658
Am I right?

118
00:08:27,094 --> 00:08:30,655
What about it? That's not something
to be talking about.

119
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:37,905
Companies can be hard on money
even if they seem to be doing well.

120
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:40,506
It happens often.

121
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:42,340
What are you saying?!

122
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,978
You talk as if I was
after their inheritance!!

123
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:50,444
It's all right. You have a perfect alibi.

124
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:54,164
You went out to dinner

125
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,088
with your secretary and subordinates
after a business meeting.

126
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:57,391
There are witnesses.

127
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:00,920
W-What are you trying to say?

128
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:03,924
You're not the culprit.

129
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:05,432
Isn't that right?

130
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:10,003
Inspector Lunge!

131
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:12,297
Oh, you.

132
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:13,769
What's going on?!

133
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:15,208
What are you talking about?

134
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,234
Don't act dumb.

135
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:20,539
I've been investigating that nephew
for the past few days.

136
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:23,378
His company might look profitable
at first glance,

137
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:25,681
but it's holding a lot of
bad stocks and bonds.

138
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:27,185
It's pretty strapped for cash.

139
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:31,185
You've even thoroughly investigated
the area around the nephew's company.

140
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,253
What is the truth?

141
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:37,561
Do you really think this case
is connected with

142
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:40,362
the middle-aged couple murders?

143
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:44,469
All the newspapers are taking
the same take as our exclusive!

144
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:48,808
It'll be a huge false report if it's
not related to that string of murders!

145
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:51,445
It's as you say.

146
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:54,081
It's the work of a copycat.

147
00:09:54,482 --> 00:09:56,678
It was made to look like
the serial killer's work.

148
00:09:57,318 --> 00:09:58,285
I thought so!

149
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:00,478
I've got to rewrite
my article immediately.

150
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:02,746
No. It's fine as it is.

151
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,582
Huh?

152
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:05,750
Continue writing your article
as if it was one of

153
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:08,659
the middle-aged couple murders.

154
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:10,363
No way!

155
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:12,165
I can't write an article of lies!

156
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,530
Just do it.

157
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:17,233
I-I'm still a journalist.

158
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:19,097
It's useless to pressure me.

159
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:21,066
Kipper, was it?

160
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:23,974
She was quite an attractive woman.

161
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:30,679
You have a comfortable household...
a lovely wife and daughter...

162
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:36,149
It's impossible to resist the charms
of such an ideal, attractive woman.

163
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:43,992
Keep writing features on the middle-
aged couple murders as you've been doing.

164
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,897
No, write even more about it
than before.

165
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:53,073
He will come if you do.

166
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:54,000
Huh?

167
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:57,373
I'm counting on you.

168
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:04,277
Yes?

169
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:11,017
There's something I wanted to
ask you about.

170
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:18,759
I see. They were such
a wonderful couple.

171
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,826
Yes.

172
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:23,865
Did they have any foster children?

173
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:24,931
No.

174
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:28,203
Did they ever live with any children
you've never seen before,

175
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:29,538
even for a little while?

176
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:35,243
Never. They took good care
of their nephew.

177
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:38,448
Oh. Would you like another
cup of tea?

178
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,150
Oh...no, I'm already...

179
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:42,048
Don't say that.

180
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:51,558
<i>There's no mistake.
It's the man from the photograph.</i>

181
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:53,195
<i>He's in my house right now.</i>

182
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:57,333
I see. Thank you
for your cooperation.

183
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:04,411
Inspector Lunge, there's someone
who wants to see you.

184
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,005
Who is it?

185
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,313
It's the nephew of the Joppes
who were killed.

186
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:13,544
You think that I'm the culprit,
don't you?

187
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:15,152
Don't you? Isn't that right?

188
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:19,322
I killed them for their fortune.

189
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,119
That's what you're really thinking.

190
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:24,761
True, I have countless debts
at the moment.

191
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,358
Their fortune they left for me
would save me from this fiasco.

192
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,596
But I'm not that kind of person!

193
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,174
Is that all you came here to say?

194
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,302
Huh? Is that all?

195
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:42,176
You have no right to say that
after treating me like the culprit!

196
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:46,946
I have somewhere
I have to go right now.

197
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:51,890
Wait! I want you to take back
the rude things you said before!!

198
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:57,329
The police stopped following you.

199
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:04,600
The police here think you're innocent.
Isn't that good enough?

200
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:08,699
Then who do you think
is the murderer?

201
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:10,938
You mean the culprit?

202
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:14,177
That doesn't matter.

203
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:15,141
Huh?

204
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,852
As long as I catch that man.

205
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:31,163
There's a bloodstain there.
Which means...

206
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,223
He missed?

207
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:41,373
Does this mean you don't think that
the Japanese doctor did it?

208
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:43,339
Well...

209
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:48,241
It's a crime made to look like the string
of middle-aged couple homicides.

210
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,447
How can you be so sure?

211
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:55,048
There's one thing in this case
that the others don't have.

212
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,821
The culprit cornered the victim here.

213
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:03,196
But instead of here...

214
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:06,866
He's finished off over there.

215
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:09,095
Why?

216
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,504
Why does he hesitate for a moment?

217
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:19,905
It isn't him.

218
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:22,407
There were emotions.

219
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:24,084
Emotions?

220
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:27,950
The crime scenes
of the man I'm after...

221
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:30,648
He takes a few valuables and tries to
make it look like a robbery.

222
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:33,722
But no emotions can be sensed
at those crime scenes.

223
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:39,561
But this crime scene is full of
emotions.

224
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:42,096
The culprit panics at the sight of

225
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:44,763
the victim's face
and his face in a mirror.

226
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,801
Well, don't worry.

227
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:50,777
The police here are incompetent.

228
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:57,109
<i>No matter how I think about it...</i>

229
00:14:57,584 --> 00:15:00,645
<i>This is a crime made to look like
Johan's crimes...</i>

230
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,186
How long is this going to continue?

231
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:07,360
How long...

232
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:18,362
It's been a while.

233
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:26,643
We finally meet, Dr. Tenma.

234
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:32,275
I've been looking for you.

235
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,546
For a long time...

236
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:38,351
I've wanted to have
a quiet talk with you.

237
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:45,522
There's no use in
running away anymore.

238
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:48,928
Let's have a quiet talk.

239
00:15:50,404 --> 00:15:54,864
How long are you going to
keep doing this, Dr. Tenma?

240
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:02,946
It's over.

241
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:16,525
If only you weren't here...

242
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:25,361
Out of the way!!

243
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:33,505
I-I did it. I killed the Joppes.

244
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,478
I'll turn myself in! Forgive me.

245
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:38,574
I'm not interested in you.

246
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:40,281
Don't get in my way.

247
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:45,854
S-Shit!!

248
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:09,244
What's with this wound?!

249
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,185
At this rate, you're going to
bleed to death.

250
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,357
<i>Who stabbed inspector Lunge?</i>

251
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,385
<i>I've got to drop him off
in front of a hospital and run away.</i>

252
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:38,737
Damn it.

253
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,117
So you've regained consciousness.

254
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:45,783
Where are the keys
to these handcuffs?

255
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:48,784
It's pointless to look for your gun.

256
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:50,484
I have it.

257
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,290
Just quickly hand me
the keys to these handcuffs!

258
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,728
I can't help you like this.

259
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:57,858
I looked at your wound.

260
00:17:58,498 --> 00:18:00,933
Luckily, it hadn't penetrated
your abdominal cavity.

261
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:03,493
But the large amount of blood
you're losing...

262
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:05,672
You'll die if we don't
stop the bleeding!!

263
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:14,876
Confess...Dr. Tenma.

264
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:16,583
What?

265
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:20,546
You murdered the director
of Eisler Memorial Hospital

266
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:21,986
along with three others.

267
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:26,553
You've been killing middle-aged
couples for the past three years.

268
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:30,364
Confess that it was all your doing.

269
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:32,828
You're really going to die.

270
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:35,828
It's all Johan's doing.

271
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:39,900
You're looking for the real culprit,
right?

272
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:42,403
Johan doesn't exist.

273
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:46,378
You are Johan, Dr. Tenma!!

274
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,338
Confess.

275
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:53,351
There wasn't anything good
in this warehouse,

276
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,548
but I found what I needed
to perform an emergency procedure.

277
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:57,381
All that's left are these hands!

278
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,658
I can save you as long as
these hands are freed!!

279
00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:04,690
You are a skillful doctor
when you're Dr. Tenma...

280
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:08,101
A good-natured man with no faults.

281
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:11,598
How many people did you kill
with those hands?

282
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,436
You're mistaken.

283
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:17,972
When are you going to
change into Johan?

284
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:22,404
When is that good-natured face
going to turn into that of a killer?

285
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:25,750
You're mistaken.

286
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,155
I don't make mistakes.

287
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:33,115
You're losing consciousness
as your blood pressure falls.

288
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,689
At your crime scenes...

289
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:37,797
You shouldn't talk anymore.

290
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:42,668
At your crime scenes...
there are no emotions.

291
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:44,270
Don't talk.

292
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,639
You lose your emotions

293
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:50,871
when you deal with life and death
every day, don't you, Dr. Tenma?

294
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:57,307
That's it. That calmness
is always at the crime scenes.

295
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,780
Perfectly calm.

296
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:02,687
You're mistaken.

297
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,822
Whenever I performed a surgery...

298
00:20:08,562 --> 00:20:12,055
Would I make a mistake?
Could I do this well?

299
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:14,765
Would trouble happen
all of a sudden?

300
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,103
I was always tense...

301
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:21,166
People's lives are at stake
with my hands.

302
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,509
My hands...

303
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:27,745
There's no way that I can be calm.

304
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:32,877
Don't...move.

305
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,553
I'm going to save you!

306
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:36,884
I'll...shoot.

307
00:20:37,724 --> 00:20:38,714
I'm going to stop your bleeding!

308
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:39,992
Where are the keys?!

309
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,561
Are they in your pants pocket?

310
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,855
I'll...shoot.

311
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:04,848
I'm relieved.

312
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:06,480
You look well.

313
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,846
You look better than
when you're working.

314
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:12,519
I'm sorry for worrying you.

315
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:16,296
It seems that that emergency
procedure was perfect.

316
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:19,457
The doctor said that
you would have died

317
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,025
if it that exact procedure
wasn't performed.

318
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:26,439
I guess this means that Tenma
saved my life.

319
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:29,608
Well, Tenma got away,

320
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:32,407
but Giebel confessed to
the murder of the Joppes.

321
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,371
You did good, Lunge.

322
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:35,674
Thank you.

323
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:39,977
What do you think?

324
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,946
Huh?

325
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:43,756
Tenma saved Lunge's life.

326
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,386
This might be problematic
in catching Tenma.

327
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:50,455
Should I remove Lunge
from the Tenma case?

328
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:56,725
Oh, I'm sorry if Inspector Lunge
is being a nuisance.

329
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,129
He's not a nuisance at all.

330
00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:01,231
He was a very pleasant man.

331
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:05,870
I keep telling him that he doesn't
have to recover that quickly,

332
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:09,246
but he's squeezing that ball
and walking down the halls.

333
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,551
It seems like he's having a lot of fun.

334
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,187
Fun?

335
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:19,021
Yes. He keeps saying that
nothing could be more fun.

336
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:24,121
What was that culprit's name?
Oh yes, Tenma.

337
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:27,397
He's said that he was having
a wonderful time

338
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:29,299
chasing a culprit like Tenma.
