1
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:09,955
No, you can't sleep here.

2
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:14,832
It's all right. It's all right.
Leave me right here.

3
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:34,450
You left her there.

4
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:38,652
Isn't that right?
You left your mother there.

5
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:42,686
The next day, you were informed
that your mother had frozen to death.

6
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:46,629
But at that time,
you thought that you weren't at fault

7
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:49,838
and that you left her there
because she told you to.

8
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:52,638
That's right.
You're not at fault.

9
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:56,142
You were letting people who
wanted to die, do what they wanted.

10
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:58,945
You're not wrong.
You're right.

11
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,543
You released them
from the pain of living.

12
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:09,780
Eva also wants to die.

13
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:19,627
<i>It was at that moment...
the devil arrived.</i>

14
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:23,698
<i>I passed by him,
careful not to look.</i>

15
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:28,933
<i>Like a child, I repeated to myself,
"Don't look, don't look."</i>

16
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:32,645
<i>"Don't dare look."</i>

17
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:54,633
<i>Eva also wants to die.</i>

18
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:58,132
<i>Kill me!</i>

19
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:02,805
<i>Leave me right here.</i>

20
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:12,448
Kenzo...

21
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:34,935
<i>I'm not going to do the devil's bidding.</i>

22
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:40,614
<i>Because nobody wants to die.</i>

23
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:35,823
Where's the woman?

24
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:38,157
Eva's not here anymore.

25
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,223
Where did you let her escape?

26
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:42,831
I finished her.

27
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:46,363
Don't lie, Martin.
If you tell us now...

28
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,039
I'm not lying.

29
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:49,834
How pitiful.

30
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:51,677
What is?

31
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:54,442
To lose your life
over a woman.

32
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:04,381
Are you up?

33
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:12,724
Our pursuers are here.

34
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:16,401
They've parked
their car outside.

35
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:19,637
It's only a matter of time now.

36
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:23,036
I took a maid's uniform.

37
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:25,737
Wear it and escape
out the back way.

38
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:28,378
What about you?

39
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:34,349
Wandering out together would be like
telling them to come and get us.

40
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:36,967
But they'll get you
if you don't run away!

41
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:38,720
I can handle them by myself.

42
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:42,820
Go to the place that's
written on the note, on the desk.

43
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:45,489
It's Tenma's hotel.

44
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,236
Get dressed. Hurry!

45
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,577
I'll be waiting at
Frankfurt Central Station.

46
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:08,651
Let's run away together.

47
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:16,427
Cut it out.
This isn't the time for jokes.

48
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:21,797
Listen ! You'll be safe if you go
to Tenma. It's what you want.

49
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:24,236
This is an order! Go now!

50
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,175
I don't remember having to
take orders from you.

51
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:37,775
Just kidding.

52
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,551
I'm going.

53
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:42,788
Okay.

54
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:47,627
Don't get yourself killed
doing something stupid.

55
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:50,663
I don't owe you that much.

56
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:53,893
See you later.

57
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:13,345
<i>Right.
I don't owe her anything.</i>

58
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,457
<i>I don't have to go
this far for her.</i>

59
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:27,764
<i>One...</i>

60
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:30,032
<i>Two...</i>

61
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,497
<i>Three...</i>

62
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:35,207
<i>Four...</i>

63
00:07:58,232 --> 00:07:59,461
I can't believe I'm alive.

64
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:11,475
Frankfurt Central Station, huh?

65
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:33,567
No more bullets.
I really am unlucky.

66
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:51,479
You idiot. Aim for the head.

67
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:07,391
<i>There was a gunfight at the Reagen
Motel in Sossenheim, Frankfurt.</i>

68
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:09,266
<i>Four men were found dead.</i>

69
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:11,605
<i>The police believe it was
a gang related dispute.</i>

70
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:13,367
<i>The police are questioning
motel employees about the incident</i>

71
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:16,968
- Robby. Did you hear that, Robby?
<i>- and are tracking down the culprit.</i>

72
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:20,874
- That's my heroic story.
<i>- None of the employees were injured.</i>

73
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:22,106
Robby?

74
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,577
<i>In other news...</i>

75
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:25,777
We're here, Martin.

76
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:30,087
Huh? Frankfurt Station?

77
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:37,728
Hey... Doctor.

78
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:46,571
I've done as much first aid as I can.
I can't do much more here.

79
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,198
Let's go to a hospital.

80
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:50,105
Stop.

81
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:53,178
I already know.

82
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,615
It's probably no good.

83
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:58,143
Eva...

84
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,047
Where is Eva?

85
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:02,847
What happened to Eva?

86
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:06,894
Didn't she come here?

87
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,462
Why are you laughing,
you idiot!

88
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:17,468
Don't talk anymore.

89
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:20,572
I can't do that.

90
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,670
Listen to me, Dr. Tenma.

91
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:26,442
Where should I begin?

92
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:31,142
I know far too much
about so many things.

93
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,250
The experiments at the Red Rose
Mansion are still continuing.

94
00:10:40,394 --> 00:10:43,728
Do you know what I mean?

95
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:49,527
Also...the devil now
has an apprentice.

96
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:57,471
That man is trying to
create a dictator.

97
00:10:57,745 --> 00:10:58,837
"That man?"

98
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:05,348
The man with glasses.
The survivor of Red Rose Mansion...

99
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,989
Peter.. .Čapek...

100
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,881
Peter. ..Čapek.

101
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:17,856
He is trying to
control the devil.

102
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,336
But the devil is...
The devil is far more terrifying.

103
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:23,598
Far more.

104
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:29,332
The Jahreszeit Hotel...
Room 606...

105
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:32,312
The devil's apprentice is there.

106
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:36,878
You mustn't look at the devil.

107
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:42,148
Can't do his bidding.

108
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:47,488
Nobody wants to die.

109
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,797
Martin!

110
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:01,104
I'm...happy...

111
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:04,308
I don't have to
look at the devil anymore.

112
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:10,881
Eva... Eva is waiting for me
at Frankfurt Central Station.

113
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,650
I'm sure...she bought
two tickets.

114
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:24,591
For as far as...
For as far as we can go.

115
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,667
Eva is waiting there?

116
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:32,436
Please protect. ..Eva.

117
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,409
Eva...

118
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,976
Don't die.

119
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:49,955
You've got to go
to the station, right?

120
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:59,595
Don't die. Don't die!

121
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:37,563
Even if you stay there, there's still
a lot of time until the first train comes.

122
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:41,039
Are you waiting for someone?

123
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,810
Ah, a man right? I can tell.

124
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:50,879
I've been working at
this station for a long time.

125
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:54,654
Then do you know if
he's going to come?

126
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:58,687
I don't know that.
I'm not a fortuneteller.

127
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:03,824
But having someone
to wait for is happiness.

128
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:06,697
Whether he comes or not.

129
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:09,368
Happiness?

130
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:15,305
Yes! When you get to be my age,
you don't get that feeling that often.

131
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:20,808
Happiness, huh?

132
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,655
Oh, could this be the person
you were waiting for?

133
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:52,576
Kenzo!

134
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:55,815
Martin is...

135
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:57,774
dead.

136
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:13,365
It seems he's not the person
she was waiting for.

137
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:26,035
He came to tell me
some important information...

138
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:30,540
with the last bit of
strength he had.

139
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:36,750
You have to leave, quickly.

140
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:40,058
Eva...

141
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:45,163
There's still time
until the first train.

142
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,166
Can you stay with me a bit?

143
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,066
Sure.

144
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:58,340
It's not alcohol,
is that all right?

145
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:03,945
That man, Martin...
didn't like alcohol.

146
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:05,575
I see.

147
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:09,549
To Martin.

148
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:20,163
It's been a while.

149
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:22,400
Yeah.

150
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:24,835
Are you eating properly?

151
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:29,108
You've gotten pretty thin.

152
00:16:30,844 --> 00:16:31,777
Yeah.

153
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:40,186
It's strange. We're holding
Martin's funeral together like this.

154
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:43,085
He was a good person.

155
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:48,258
I did such a horrible thing
to such a good person.

156
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:57,036
I made him wear a suit and tie
like the one I gave you.

157
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:03,108
How horrible. I'm horrible.

158
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:08,709
Why am I still alive?

159
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:15,653
I also gave false testimony against
you and continued to pin the guilt on you.

160
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,656
Why am I still alive?!

161
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,360
Because Martin protected you.

162
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:27,697
Why did he?

163
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:31,997
Why would he protect
a woman like me?!

164
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:35,305
Nobody wants to die.

165
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,312
That's what Martin said.

166
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:48,653
He said he was happy that
you were waiting at the station.

167
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,984
He said he was
happy about that.

168
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:13,737
Munich...

169
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,313
Go to Munich.

170
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:19,551
I know a psychiatrist there.

171
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:23,383
Dr. Reichwein...

172
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:25,621
Do you know him?

173
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,624
Yes.

174
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:31,194
Anyway, stay with Dr. Reichwein.

175
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,657
He'll take care of you.

176
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:35,824
And go to the police.

177
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:40,271
Tell them that you're being chased by
The Baby's organization in Frankfurt.

178
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:45,275
And that Roberto's after you.
Tell them everything.

179
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:49,643
I'll tell them about you too.
You haven't killed anyone!

180
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,481
It was all Johan's doing!
I'll tell them everything.

181
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,554
So come to Munich too...

182
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:01,053
He's right in front of me.

183
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:02,660
Huh?

184
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,625
He's so close.

185
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:07,297
You saw him
at the party, didn't you?

186
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:10,767
Johan's right in front of me.

187
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:14,871
I've got to end this.

188
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:23,180
There can't be any more
victims like Martin.

189
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:25,579
Do you understand?

190
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:30,449
I've got to end this.

191
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:41,834
I'll send a letter to Dr. Reichwein.

192
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:45,765
I'll give him all the information I know.

193
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,197
Kenzo...

194
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:50,439
Now go.

195
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,044
But Kenzo...

196
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:55,711
The only way you can help me
is by going to Munich

197
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:57,876
and telling everything
you know.

198
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:55,598
<i>I'm glad you helped us
find Johan.</i>

199
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:59,171
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

200
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:04,441
<i>I heard that there
was someone</i>

201
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:07,283
<i>who matched his description
here in Frankfurt.</i>

202
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:10,049
<i>That's why I had you
identify him.</i>

203
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:13,656
<i>Excuse me interrupting your dinner.
You have a telephone call.</i>

204
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:15,518
<i>Okay.</i>

205
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,227
<i>Hello? It's me.</i>

206
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,094
<i>Johan...</i>

207
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:25,235
<i>I see. Where is he?</i>

208
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:28,431
<i>An apartment on
Haldecker street.</i>

209
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:37,178
"An apartment on
Haldecker street."

210
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:44,482
<i>Johan...
even I can end all this.</i>

211
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:56,166
<i>The Jahreszeit Hotel...
Room 606...</i>

212
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:59,529
<i>The devil's apprentice
is there.</i>

213
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:12,084
Are you the one
that wanted a gun?

214
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:13,680
Yes.

215
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:15,880
I have all sorts of guns.

216
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,951
I want the biggest one
you have.

217
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:23,058
Beginners can't handle
the big ones.

218
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:26,226
What are you
planning to shoot?

219
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:32,294
A devil.
