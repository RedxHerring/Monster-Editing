1
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:32,379
It's me.
Is anybody here?

2
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,355
J-Johan...

3
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:19,258
At Red Rose Mansion...

4
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:24,762
many people drank that wine.

5
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:37,779
It's all right. See?
I'm drinking it too.

6
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:47,023
What happened to the bodyguards
who are supposed to be here?

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,701
Why...did you kill the Baby?

8
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:06,743
We're supposed to be allies!
You were helping us.

9
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:10,281
We were going to find and
bring your sister to you.

10
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:11,886
Everything is going as planned.

11
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:19,791
Your sister. ..
We've already captured your sister.

12
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:23,496
If something happens to me,
your sister will...

13
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:26,524
Nothing will go your way.

14
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,826
Got that? Everything will
go according to my plans.

15
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:31,802
What am I?

16
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:37,911
The monster inside of me.. .
wasn't inside me.

17
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:41,179
It was outside of me.

18
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:44,885
What are you trying to say?

19
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:49,183
Franz Bonaparta...

20
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,529
is alive, isn't he?

21
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:36,423
I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour,
Miss Nina Fortner.

22
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:47,474
Miss Fortner?

23
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:49,704
Miss Nina Fortner?

24
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:05,826
Don't move!

25
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:09,792
Who ordered you
to come here?

26
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:12,099
I see.

27
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,831
As the Baby told us,
you're no ordinary girl.

28
00:05:17,538 --> 00:05:18,528
The Baby...

29
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:22,374
Did the Baby
order you to get me?

30
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:25,979
No. The Baby is dead.

31
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:27,481
Dead?

32
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:31,650
Peter Čapek is the one
who told us to get you.

33
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,656
It seems that if we take you as
a hostage, your safety is ensured.

34
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:37,891
Čapek...

35
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:40,861
Take me.

36
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,763
I'll go see Peter Čapek.

37
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:51,538
This is the police.

38
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,971
We'll be conducting a search
of the home of Milan Kolas,

39
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:00,844
a suspect in Roedelheim
Convention Center Shooting.

40
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:02,809
Begin.

41
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:05,853
Out of the way!

42
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:08,553
Come on,
move out of the way!

43
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:12,651
Is this Kolas' room?

44
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:14,094
So it seems.

45
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:30,605
The police are going to
search this place soon.

46
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,974
I have to go.

47
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,183
Milan...

48
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:40,550
Did Milan really die?

49
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,123
Milan...

50
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:48,795
Milan...died for us.

51
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:53,698
Čapek killed our relatives.

52
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:58,896
He died trying to
get revenge for us.

53
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:05,646
Revenge...

54
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:07,508
Let's get revenge.

55
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:10,941
Let's get revenge!

56
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:12,185
Let's get revenge!

57
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,944
- Let's get revenge !
- Let's get revenge!

58
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:15,749
No!

59
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,459
You mustn't think that way.

60
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,626
But. .. But Milan. ..
Milan...

61
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:23,662
Milan wouldn't
want you to do that!

62
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:33,837
Revenge leads to more revenge.
It will repeat itself over and over.

63
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:39,005
Milan didn't want you
to think that way.

64
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:44,079
Someone has to stop it.

65
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:48,148
Milan tried to put an end to this.

66
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:53,826
What was Milan's true wish?

67
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:58,854
To visit each other's
homelands together.

68
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:05,463
Study hard. Someday,
that dream will come true.

69
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:16,883
Thank you for everything,
Mr. Mustafa.

70
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:21,254
Mrs. Minh...

71
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,057
Mrs. Suleiman...

72
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:26,017
Thank you for the delicious food.

73
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:28,895
Dr. Tenma...

74
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,620
You aren't going to...

75
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:52,145
There is a ton of information about
a man called Peter Čapek, isn't there?

76
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:59,358
Yeah. It seems like Milan Kolas
was after this Čapek.

77
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:03,728
Find this man immediately
and question him.

78
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:04,490
Inspector!

79
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:10,569
A man known as The Baby, the leader
of a right-wing extremist organization,

80
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,629
was killed at the Kaiser Hotel.

81
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:28,678
Someone has to...
I have to stop this.

82
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,963
It's the young man who's
come in and out of this hotel

83
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:44,869
countless times
with Peter Čapek.

84
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:55,175
Is that the "devil's apprentice"?

85
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:05,016
Follow that car.

86
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:46,192
Johan...

87
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,605
Are you there, Johan?

88
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:18,430
Where have you been Johan?

89
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:25,401
If I remember correctly,
you're... Eva.

90
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:26,640
Where is he?

91
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:30,505
Where is Johan right now?

92
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:37,184
Mr. Čapek...

93
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:38,946
We've brought Nina.

94
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:46,159
Mr. Čapek...

95
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:59,802
Peter.. .Čapek...

96
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:03,571
<i>Come here.
There's nothing to be afraid of.</i>

97
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:07,480
H-Hey!

98
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:08,982
Wait. Stop!

99
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,786
Which one is it?
Is it Johan?

100
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:24,659
Or is it his sister?

101
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,834
At this point,
they're both the same.

102
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:34,368
Johan let me live.

103
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:39,041
Because the one that's
going to kill me...

104
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,017
is his sister.

105
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,524
Everything is
going as planned.

106
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,190
Whose plan? Mine?

107
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:01,462
Johan's?

108
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:11,009
Whose... Whose plan is it?

109
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,982
Hurry up, kill me.

110
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:32,555
Johan was...here, right?

111
00:13:36,704 --> 00:13:37,762
Where did he go?

112
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,830
Take me to him.

113
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:45,474
Where is Johan right now?

114
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:54,054
It's pitch dark.

115
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,448
I'm scared.

116
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,526
I want to get out
of here quickly.

117
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:05,256
If we go out now...

118
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:09,402
I wonder if it's still going on.

119
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:12,764
The killing...

120
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,871
If I hadn't introduced you two...

121
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:24,382
at that party...

122
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,687
You and that devil...

123
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:35,419
If I hadn't done that...

124
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:39,455
Martin wouldn't...

125
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:43,470
Martin wouldn't...

126
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:50,132
...wouldn't have had to die.

127
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,538
All right. Hold on a second.

128
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:56,449
Where is Johan?

129
00:14:57,251 --> 00:15:00,551
I don't know.
I'd like to know that, too.

130
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:02,180
Calm down...

131
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:06,286
I've been watching
this apartment for two weeks.

132
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:11,730
He never showed up.
Where else could he be?

133
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:16,293
As I said, I don't know.
Really.

134
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,502
My ear... My ear!

135
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:25,470
I'm serious.

136
00:15:25,913 --> 00:15:27,779
It hurts. It hurts!

137
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:29,676
The next time,
it won't be just an ear.

138
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:33,985
Christof Sievernich...

139
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,882
I looked you up.

140
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,697
Though, I did know about
your late father, Ernest,

141
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,493
without having to
looking him up.

142
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:51,036
The Sievernich Financial Group
is quite prominent in Frankfurt...

143
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:52,503
no, in all of Germany.

144
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:56,900
Who would have thought that you
were the heir to that financial group?

145
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:03,978
What is Peter Čapek planning to do
by bringing you and Johan together?

146
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:08,753
I'm bleeding a lot.
Help me out.

147
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:14,286
What's going to happen when you
and that devil are brought together?!

148
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:17,454
No. That's wrong.

149
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:18,923
What's wrong?!

150
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,367
Čapek thinks that
he introduced us.

151
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:30,169
But Johan and I have known
each other for a long time.

152
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:31,778
What?

153
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:40,279
Čapek doesn't know that we were
friends in East Berlin over ten years ago.

154
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:44,252
Over ten years ago.. .
In East Berlin?

155
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:47,961
I'm the adopted son
of the Sievernich's.

156
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:53,727
Actually, I was sold to them
in secret by a smuggler.

157
00:16:56,003 --> 00:17:04,003
Johan and I met in
East Berlin's 511 Kinderheim.

158
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:06,307
511 ...

159
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:11,750
We met there...and survived.

160
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:17,084
He and I survived.

161
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:21,685
I'm scared.

162
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:24,865
I'm hungry.

163
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,524
I really need to pee.

164
00:17:31,004 --> 00:17:34,838
I wonder if the killing
has stopped.

165
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,308
I wonder if everyone died.

166
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:43,650
Let's go out.

167
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:44,543
- Huh?
- Huh?

168
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:46,276
It's all right.

169
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:49,947
It's gotten quiet outside.

170
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:56,020
It's all right. Let's take a look.
We'll go crazy if we stay here.

171
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,131
I-I'll go take a look.

172
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:06,941
Come back and tell us
if things are all right.

173
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:08,441
O-Okay.

174
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:19,185
I don't know why, but everyone at
511 Kinderheim went crazy that day.

175
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,958
It wasn't just the children.

176
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:28,026
Even the instructors
began killing each other.

177
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:33,931
He hasn't come back.

178
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:35,863
He ran away.

179
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:36,862
Huh?

180
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,796
He left us behind
and ran away.

181
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:41,441
How terrible.

182
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:43,838
He tried to save himself.

183
00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:45,668
You think so?

184
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,577
Go take a look
if you think I'm lying.

185
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:55,751
He's probably happily eating
a warm meal right about now.

186
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,955
A warm meal!

187
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:01,285
I-I'm going to take a quick look.

188
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,227
You won't betray me, right?

189
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:09,629
O-Of course not.

190
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:17,871
He also didn't come back.

191
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,876
I'm going to keep on hiding.

192
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:31,954
Wracked with hunger and thirst,
I fell in and out of a light sleep.

193
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,302
Am I going to die like this?

194
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:49,669
There he stood.

195
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,577
It's just you and me.

196
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:58,183
I have a plan.

197
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,248
That was Johan?

198
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:07,786
Čapek calling it
his plan is laughable.

199
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:11,423
Johan and I talked about it constantly
when we were children.

200
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:14,727
About what?
What is his plan?

201
00:20:17,037 --> 00:20:18,266
Do you want to hear it?

202
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,206
Well...

203
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:36,351
You can't do that.
You can't shoot my ear!

204
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:42,094
To become a politician,
a face is very important!

205
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:44,030
You can't do that.

206
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:48,728
I'm going to put the world
into motion. Right?

207
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:53,564
I'm going to team up with Johan
and make the world mine.

208
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:55,438
Right?

209
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:58,878
What are you going to
do about my ear?!

210
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:02,280
You can't interfere
with my plan.

211
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:04,241
You can't!

212
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:05,284
Drop your gun!

213
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,523
Kenzo?

214
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:31,670
Johan told me to tell his sister,
where he was if she came

215
00:21:32,312 --> 00:21:37,716
and that his sister would
probably kill me afterwards.

216
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:41,584
Why won't you kill me?

217
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:48,285
Your memories...

218
00:21:48,762 --> 00:21:50,821
Did you get them all back?

219
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:53,392
Yes.

220
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:57,665
Then why won't you kill me?

221
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,745
You must be overflowing
with hatred, anger and grief.

222
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:18,688
What are we?
You know, don't you?

223
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:22,217
I've heard things...

224
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:30,627
about how you twins were born.
