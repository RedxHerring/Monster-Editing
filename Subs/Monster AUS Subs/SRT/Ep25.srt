1
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:16,935
"Oh, Corinna, why are your letters
ever so short?"

2
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:25,639
"As with Eupolis the astro...astro,
astrologist, you drive my heart mad."

3
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:33,664
"Even the gold of ideas fades,
and the work of Galonius..."

4
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:34,951
That's enough.

5
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:39,616
I said that there's no need
to read any further.

6
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:42,060
Umm... Is there something wrong?

7
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:45,560
That's enough from you. Get out!

8
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:48,136
I-I'm very sorry!

9
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:50,271
Did I do something to upset you?

10
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:54,003
Those who cannot
pronounce Latin correctly

11
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,840
do not have the right to
read books to me!

12
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:58,637
I-I'm sorry.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,104
I'll be careful next time!

14
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:02,281
I told you to leave!

15
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:57,889
You got quite the scolding
at the mansion.

16
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:03,537
Cheer up, Mr. Business Admin
Student, Karl Neumann!

17
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,607
How do you know who I am?
Who are you?

18
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:11,637
I'm Lotte Frank.
I'm in cultural anthropology.

19
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:16,305
Do you read books for him
part-time as well?

20
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:19,185
No, I look after him.

21
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:23,521
He only has male students
read to him.

22
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:25,523
You're in charge of Tuesdays.

23
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:30,990
Other students read to him
on other days. He can barely see.

24
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,694
So, what do you think of

25
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,569
the mysterious tycoon,
Hans Georg Schuwald?

26
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:44,873
I-I don't know. I jumped at the job
because the pay was good.

27
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:48,275
Have you heard all the rumors
about him?

28
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,047
It's said that he can control the stocks
of businesses throughout Germany

29
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,487
with a single phone call
from his mansion.

30
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,925
He's called
the Howard Hughes of Bavaria.

31
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,059
He has no family!
There's no one close to him!

32
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,865
But his fortune continues to grow!

33
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,227
What do you think he's going to do
with that money?

34
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:08,328
Who knows?

35
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:10,830
But there's an even greater mystery.

36
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:14,206
His other nickname is
"The Vampire of Bavaria."

37
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:15,676
Vampire?

38
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,378
When the bell tolls at 2:00 AM,

39
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:23,475
he drives into town with his butler
in a hearse.

40
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:27,483
It's like something
from a gothic horror story.

41
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:29,649
He's probably just taking a walk.

42
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:33,225
I'm going to find out soon
if he really is just taking a walk.

43
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,254
What do you mean, "find out"?

44
00:04:35,997 --> 00:04:37,726
It's for my research paper!

45
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,728
"The Intellectual Activities
of Medieval and Present-day

46
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,532
Business Men of Bavaria."

47
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:46,169
He'll be a great sample.

48
00:04:46,774 --> 00:04:49,266
Is that why you looked me up?

49
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:52,245
I just looked up
your name and department.

50
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:56,078
Well, don't worry that
Schuwald yelled at you.

51
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:58,984
He says mean things
to all the other students.

52
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:03,553
Well... I'm used to being
yelled at and being hit.

53
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:05,218
Used to it?

54
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:09,429
Y-Yeah. I was shunted around to
different foster homes as a kid.

55
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:10,992
I went through a lot.

56
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,227
Come to think of it, you're not from
any of the local prep schools, are you?

57
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:17,661
You really did look me up.

58
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:21,637
I see. So you don't have parents.

59
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:23,970
To be honest...

60
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:26,071
I came to this university in Munich

61
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:28,013
because I thought I could
meet my mother.

62
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:30,483
Your mom's in Munich?

63
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:32,248
So, did you meet her?

64
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:35,585
No. It doesn't matter anymore.

65
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,549
What?! Why?

66
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,452
You're already so close.

67
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:42,453
You know your mom's name,
don't you?

68
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:43,323
Yeah.

69
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:44,765
What's her name?

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,434
I said it doesn't matter anymore.

71
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:49,232
Tell me!

72
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,164
I'm already interested.
I'm going to find out anyway!

73
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:54,400
Margot...

74
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,302
Margot Langer.

75
00:05:58,112 --> 00:06:00,843
It'll be easy to find her
if you know that much!

76
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:02,015
Go meet her.

77
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:03,613
Your mom will be delighted!

78
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:06,283
I said...it doesn't matter anymore.

79
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:11,884
Margot Langer...

80
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:13,154
Margot Langer...

81
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:17,698
No way!!

82
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:22,593
"His dash, like a chestnut mare"'

83
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,301
"gathered thunder in his blood
and caused great waves..."

84
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,843
I can't stand listening to this.

85
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:32,378
I only love beautiful things.

86
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:34,879
I can't stand listening to this.

87
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,686
Why didn't you tell me something
so important?

88
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,718
I looked up your mom.

89
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:49,893
I don't know what to say.

90
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:52,562
I said it doesn't matter anymore,
didn't I?

91
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:57,362
Karl... Is there some way
I can help you?

92
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:59,336
Thank you. It's all right.

93
00:07:00,474 --> 00:07:01,441
Karl...

94
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,481
Lotte...you said that you were
going to find out where

95
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:11,644
Hans Schuwald goes at night,
didn't you?

96
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:12,645
Huh?

97
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:15,153
Can I go with you?

98
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,849
Yeah, of course!
It'd be great if you could.

99
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:25,022
I'm telling you, it's true!

100
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:26,466
It's the greatest scoop since

101
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:28,593
the Supernatural Phenomenon
Research Group was started.

102
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:30,993
I wonder about that.

103
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:35,334
Anyway, there's no mistake that
this poem was written in 1502

104
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:39,471
by Bishop Gropius, one of
the founders of this university!

105
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:41,882
This verse is the important part!

106
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:45,352
"On the second to the last great year"'

107
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,465
"Thursday's boy will
come to this land"

108
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:50,253
"and the books shall be
engulfed in flames."

109
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:53,256
"The entire world will be
engulfed in sorrow."

110
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:55,824
So, what about it?

111
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,259
Don't you understand?

112
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,692
Look. "The second
to the last great year."

113
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,136
This is 1996.
In other words, this year.

114
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:07,433
Why?

115
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:10,740
The "great year" is a leap year.

116
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:14,641
The only leap year after this one
in this century is the year 2000.

117
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:17,378
He will "come to this land"

118
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:19,044
"and the books shall be
engulfed in flames."

119
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:23,351
"The books of this land" means that
this university is going to burn down!

120
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:26,483
Then what's "Thursday's boy"?

121
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:30,695
Thursday, or Donnerstag,
comes from the word, "Donner."

122
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:32,791
In other words, "thunder."

123
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:34,226
Which means that
it's the god of thunder!

124
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,194
That's pretty far-fetched!

125
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:39,069
This isn't funny!

126
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:41,205
This is the feature of our next bulletin!

127
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,742
I don't mind printing this,
but who's going to believe

128
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:48,805
that a god of destruction
is coming to this university?

129
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:02,662
Vampire of Bavaria, huh?!

130
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:06,158
This is the truth behind
his mysterious prowling?

131
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:08,663
How disillusioning.

132
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:10,129
He came out.

133
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,538
How stupid. I'm leaving!

134
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:20,209
Okay, be careful!

135
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:21,107
Huh?

136
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:22,647
I'm going to go.

137
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,245
Go where?

138
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:36,121
Hey, let's not do this!

139
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,689
Yeah. This isn't a place for a girl.
Go home!

140
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:44,664
"I only love beautiful things."

141
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:45,898
Huh?

142
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:52,112
I want to know
how pathetic a man he is!

143
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:58,274
It's open.

144
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:08,962
If you're looking for a girl,
you've come to the wrong place.

145
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:11,832
I retired a long time ago.

146
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,526
Who are you?

147
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,105
You should introduce yourself first
when you go to someone else's place.

148
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,140
I'm Margot Langer.

149
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:31,781
You look like students.

150
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:33,348
Y-Yes.

151
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:37,055
I'm working part-time
for Hans Schuwald.

152
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,324
So what do you want from me?

153
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:43,862
Why does he... Why does
Hans Schuwald come here?

154
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,967
He comes for fun.

155
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:54,971
Or so I'd like to say, but it seems like
he can't function down there.

156
00:10:57,645 --> 00:10:59,477
He comes to give me money.

157
00:10:59,914 --> 00:11:00,608
Huh?

158
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:02,005
It's only right.

159
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:07,947
He wept and apologized to me
when I told him my name.

160
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:12,490
He made me bear a child
and threw me out like trash.

161
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:17,494
Karl...could it be that
you're Hans Schuwald's child?

162
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:19,432
Oh...but...

163
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,336
That's a lie. You're...you're...
not Margot Langer!

164
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:28,308
That's right!
It was in the newspaper a year ago!

165
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,237
"Former Prostitute"... Oh...

166
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,242
"Former Prostitute, Margot Langer,
Murdered. Culprit Still Unknown."

167
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:37,951
His mother is already dead!

168
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:43,248
You used that to pretend to be
my mother...Margot Langer.

169
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:45,923
So you could swindle money
from Hans Schuwald.

170
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:52,894
He knows.

171
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:58,031
He pays me knowing that
I'm not the real one.

172
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:00,200
He knows that the real Margot,

173
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:02,299
the one he should be
paying money to,

174
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:03,673
is no longer in this world.

175
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:06,710
This is his way of atoning
for what he did to her.

176
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:08,711
Money, money, money!

177
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:11,685
He lived only for money.

178
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,947
This is the only way.

179
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:21,151
You talk big, but people
aren't that different.

180
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:24,120
He's an old man without much time.

181
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:30,570
You should tell him that you're
his son and get that huge fortune.

182
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:31,795
What are you trying to say?!

183
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:34,300
You call me a liar, but...

184
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:39,445
I'm not so sure about you, either.

185
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:42,642
There's one more.

186
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:46,084
There's another boy
who says that he's his son.

187
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:51,925
He came here like you did
and had the same story.

188
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:55,554
No way. It can't be...

189
00:12:57,698 --> 00:13:00,099
It's a lie. He's lying!

190
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:05,500
I don't know who's lying.

191
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:08,466
Both look like fakes to me.

192
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:10,543
Who is he?

193
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:11,736
He's the same as you.

194
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:17,278
You take turns during the week
to read books to Schuwald, don't you?

195
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:20,086
He's one of the readers.

196
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:25,058
Yes, I believe he was Thursday's boy.

197
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,795
Why don't you tell her
that you're the real one?!

198
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:38,728
I...I was shunted around to
different foster homes as a kid.

199
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,340
I went through a lot.

200
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:46,441
But my current foster parents
are really good to me.

201
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,440
No matter how grateful I am to them,
it's not enough.

202
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:53,882
That's why I want to meet
my real parents.

203
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:58,750
I thought by learning how pathetic
my real father was

204
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:01,693
I could love my current foster parents
from the bottom of my heart.

205
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:04,959
That's all it was.

206
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,297
Have you ever seen
Thursday's boy?

207
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:16,438
I'm off on Thursdays.

208
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:20,245
But once, I went to
get something I forgot.

209
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,645
You've seen him?

210
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:24,150
What was he like?

211
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:25,352
What was he like?

212
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:29,388
He was blond and had
a very handsome face.

213
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:40,966
<i>Who is Thursday's boy?</i>

214
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:47,171
<i>There is someone in this university
who is pretending to be me.</i>

215
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:50,944
<i>Listen, Karl.</i>

216
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:52,940
<i>Listen well to what
your mother has to say!</i>

217
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:56,042
<i>Take this money and ride the train
at Platform 5.</i>

218
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,852
<i>Get off at the eighth station.
There will be a lady called Marta.</i>

219
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:02,155
<i>What about you, Mom?</i>

220
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:04,987
<i>I told you that I can't go with you.</i>

221
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,226
<i>Are the police after you?</i>

222
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:11,563
<i>I'll stay with you.</i>

223
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:12,258
<i>No!</i>

224
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:15,197
<i>You'll be put in the orphanage here,
if you stay with me!</i>

225
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:17,996
<i>You'll continue to be called
a prostitute's child if you stay here.</i>

226
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,569
<i>Now, quickly.</i>

227
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:22,809
<i>What about Dad?</i>

228
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,636
<i>Huh?</i>

229
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:28,643
<i>My dad is Hans Georg Schuwald,
isn't he?</i>

230
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,177
<i>Who told you that?</i>

231
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:32,585
<i>Mrs. Bella from across the street
told me so.</i>

232
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:34,582
<i>He's really rich, isn't he?</i>

233
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:39,191
<i>She said that he abandoned me.</i>

234
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:46,024
<i>You weren't abandoned!</i>

235
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:49,394
<i>Then I'm going to where Dad is.</i>

236
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:50,770
<i>Not right now!</i>

237
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:52,030
<i>When would be okay?</i>

238
00:15:53,574 --> 00:15:54,700
<i>When you're bigger.</i>

239
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:58,139
<i>If you're an adult
and still want to meet him.</i>

240
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:01,077
<i>But you mustn't expect anything.</i>

241
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:03,410
<i>You mustn't hate him
even if he's cold to you!</i>

242
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:04,978
<i>Why?</i>

243
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,918
<i>Because I don't hate him.</i>

244
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:22,493
<i>Take this with you.</i>

245
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:25,629
<i>This is something your father
gave you when you were born.</i>

246
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:32,809
Karl, I found out!

247
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:36,542
I found out who Thursday's boy is!

248
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,576
What?!

249
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:41,254
His name is Edmund Fahren!

250
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:42,953
He's a student from
the literature department.

251
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,557
There's no mistake.

252
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,855
He's working part-time
reading books at Schuwald's place.

253
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:48,288
He's in charge of Thursdays!

254
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:50,589
Edmund Fahren...

255
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,932
Here it is!
This class has just finished a lecture.

256
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,167
Say!

257
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:04,101
I want to see Edmund Fahren.

258
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:05,704
Oh...

259
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:08,372
Edmund! Are you here?

260
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:09,883
Edmund?

261
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,082
He didn't come to class today.

262
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,486
That's the case.

263
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,653
Is that so?

264
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,492
That's too bad.

265
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:26,859
But it's only a matter of time
before we catch that fraud.

266
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:30,702
You're the one who's going to inherit
Schuwald's great fortune!

267
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:32,262
That's not it.

268
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:33,365
Huh?

269
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:36,032
His fortune doesn't matter.

270
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:37,169
But...

271
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:40,708
Schuwald can have all the money
sucked out of him...

272
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:42,141
But...

273
00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:43,242
But?

274
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:48,047
But...I can't forgive
this Edmund Fahren

275
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:50,886
for saying that he's my mom's son.

276
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:03,736
"As the petals of your silk flowers
which swayed in the breeze"'

277
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:06,364
"the mockingbird cried in my heart."

278
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:17,076
You're not saying anything today,
Mr. Schuwald.

279
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,051
I yell at you so much.
Why don't you quit?

280
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,791
Is it because the money is good?

281
00:18:27,694 --> 00:18:28,661
That's...

282
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:34,364
That's...not it.

283
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:38,161
Is money the only thing
you can talk about?

284
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,599
It's as you say.

285
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:44,671
Who are your parents?

286
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:49,874
I was taken in by foster parents.

287
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,178
I see. I asked you
something unpleasant.

288
00:18:54,221 --> 00:18:56,747
Don't you want to meet
your real parents?

289
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:01,787
To be honest...

290
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:03,889
I...

291
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:09,165
It seems that boy who came to me
is the real one.

292
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:10,229
Huh?

293
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:12,906
He's not after money.

294
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:14,400
He?

295
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:16,900
No. I'm just talking to myself.

296
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:19,874
You can leave already.

297
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:25,986
Oh, also...

298
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:33,156
Your Latin has gotten better.

299
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:35,923
Thank you very much.

300
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,901
It seems that Edmund Fahren
is absent again today.

301
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,773
He's probably in bed with the cold.
Honestly...

302
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:56,280
There's no need to be hasty.
Tomorrow is Thursday.

303
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:59,278
He'll go to Schuwald's.

304
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:01,251
Ah, I see!

305
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:04,821
You're going to expose him
right in front of Schuwald.

306
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:08,520
Let's do it! Let's get him!

307
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:13,829
He hasn't come.

308
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:16,032
An hour has already passed.

309
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:20,763
If he has a cold,
we can attack him in bed.

310
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:22,434
Say...

311
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:25,708
Want to barge into his room?

312
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:28,778
You even looked up
Fahren's address?

313
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,481
204, 204, 204...

314
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,417
Here it is.

315
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,996
Let's do it.

316
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:23,500
Things have gotten pretty serious.

317
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:26,929
The whole school is
talking about Edmund Fahren.

318
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:29,234
Who would have thought that
he had committed suicide.

319
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:34,039
His suicide note was printed
in the school paper, wasn't it?

320
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:37,407
"I can no longer
continue to deceive."

321
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:39,981
This is probably...

322
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:41,447
Yeah.

323
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:44,855
He was weighed down by
a guilty conscience

324
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:46,825
for pretending to be Schuwald's son
to get close to him.

325
00:21:48,128 --> 00:21:49,994
He shouldn't have done it
in the first place

326
00:21:50,063 --> 00:21:52,054
if it was going to drive him
to his death.

327
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:00,940
Lotte, you must have had
a rough time yesterday.

328
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:01,867
Oh.

329
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:07,236
Yeah. We were questioned all day.

330
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:10,242
The reading job was called off today.

331
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:13,280
Mr. Schuwald was very depressed.

332
00:22:13,587 --> 00:22:15,681
Oh...Karl, let me introduce you.

333
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:17,987
He's in charge of Fridays.

334
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,258
Pleased to meet you.

335
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:22,855
A pleasure! I'm Karl Neumann
in the economics department.

336
00:22:27,434 --> 00:22:30,529
I'm Johan Liebert
in the School of Law.
