1
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:09,226
I bought you a bus ticket...

2
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:12,324
Tenma...there's a way to

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,698
turn yourself in now
and prove your innocence!

4
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:16,497
I'll help you!

5
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:22,467
I'm...not chasing Johan
to prove my innocence!

6
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:23,837
Huh?

7
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:26,043
Thank you, Rudy.

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:28,975
Tenma...

9
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:31,074
Could it be that you're
going to kill Johan?

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,649
Oh yeah! I never despised you...

11
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:38,685
I thought you were an interesting guy,

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,989
but I never had the chance
to talk to you.

13
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,127
But now we've finally become friends!

14
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:47,429
But...when I cheated back then...

15
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:52,063
I also cheated back then.

16
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:00,839
Tenma...

17
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:32,806
Did you see the sign just now?

18
00:01:33,247 --> 00:01:36,979
Oh, sorry. I was looking at this map...

19
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:39,076
Is it this way?

20
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,952
Or that way?

21
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:43,616
Which direction are we facing?

22
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:47,556
Where did you get that map?

23
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:52,934
Oh. Why, at the car rental counter,
of course.

24
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,595
I thought so.

25
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,937
It was probably while I was
using the bathroom.

26
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:01,802
At my age, it's impossible for me

27
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:04,504
to read intricate maps like this
to begin with...

28
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:07,472
That's because you left
your reading glasses at the airport.

29
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:13,777
Wippenhausen, Ampertshausen,
Gartelshausen...

30
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,853
What's with those convoluted names?

31
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,919
That's interesting. I wonder if
Germans think the same thing

32
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,692
when they come to England.

33
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:28,429
Anyway, where's the next crossroad?

34
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,896
Hmm...

35
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:32,699
Oh my.

36
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:35,806
There's a person.
We can ask for directions.

37
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:39,545
It's all right. Let's keep going.

38
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:40,674
Oh my...

39
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:42,614
But they're hitchhikers...

40
00:02:43,317 --> 00:02:44,341
Why don't we give them a ride?

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,286
And what'll we do if the stranger
gives us trouble?

42
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:50,949
But look.

43
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:58,628
He's with such a small child.
I feel sorry for him. Let them on.

44
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:09,766
Aren't you glad, Tenma?

45
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:10,936
They stopped for us!

46
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:11,971
Yeah...

47
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:46,397
Guten tag. Bitte...

48
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:49,906
I don't know German.

49
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:51,737
Can you speak English?

50
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,606
Oh, you're English.

51
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:56,846
I want to go to Freiham.
Could you give me a lift?

52
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,250
Lend me that map.

53
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,148
Here.

54
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:02,651
Where is that place?

55
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,616
Huh?

56
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:05,290
The place you want to get to.

57
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,919
Oh... Umm...

58
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:11,891
Right now, we're around here,
so it's further south...

59
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:15,433
Oh my. It's in the same direction
we're going.

60
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:16,563
Yes...

61
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:19,136
Now, hop on in.

62
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,407
Danke schön!

63
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,177
What's your relationship?

64
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:31,977
Huh?

65
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:35,255
You clearly aren't related.

66
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,086
You're Asian and it seems like
that kid is German...

67
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:41,457
O-Oh...

68
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:43,753
He's the child of a friend.

69
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:45,791
Judging by the way you look...

70
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,900
Are you working in
some specialized field of work?

71
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,796
Huh?

72
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:53,035
It's the way you talk...
and your demeanor...

73
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:54,208
Dear...

74
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:56,076
Stop already.

75
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:59,043
It's that bad habit of yours...

76
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:04,878
Sorry. He can't shake off
that bad habit.

77
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,550
He's an ex-police officer.

78
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,458
What did she say?

79
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:12,685
Well...

80
00:06:13,094 --> 00:06:14,892
It seems he's a police officer.

81
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,363
Let's get out, Tenma...

82
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:21,561
No...

83
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:25,173
Oh... Um... So...

84
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:29,171
You're taking a trip
now that your husband's retired?

85
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,771
Yes...well...

86
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:33,178
My husband is devoted to his work...

87
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:37,574
He never would have thought of
taking a trip together.

88
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:42,386
Sorry for interrupting
your time together...

89
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:45,986
Umm, if we're being a nuisance,
we can...

90
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:51,163
No... We were able to rent a car,
but we can't read the map.

91
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:53,860
We also have problems
ordering food...

92
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:55,732
We'd feel more secure

93
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:57,737
traveling with someone
who could act as a translator.

94
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,766
Really...

95
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,677
What'll we do?

96
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:48,886
We can't do anything about this...

97
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,524
We've got to go to
a nearby gas station.

98
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,655
Oh, there's a car!

99
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:55,959
Hey, stop!

100
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,454
Stop!

101
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:01,868
What's wrong?

102
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:02,993
We're out of gas.

103
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,260
Oh...

104
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:08,131
Well, that's a real problem out here...

105
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:12,946
Well, I can take two of you.

106
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:16,516
Mr. Jones...

107
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,484
It's fine. Just get on.

108
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,680
But...

109
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:23,447
You don't have to bother
sticking around with us.

110
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:31,764
So, when I get to
the nearest gas station,

111
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,926
I'll inform someone
that your car broke down.

112
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:37,438
Okay. I would appreciate
if you could do that.

113
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:55,546
Aren't you glad, Tenma?

114
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,619
We switched rides so easily.

115
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:58,885
Yeah...

116
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:16,710
At any rate, take me to the gas
station.

117
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:19,174
There are no stations here.

118
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:19,939
Huh?

119
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:42,799
They sure are late...

120
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:45,465
Yeah...

121
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:49,573
Someone from the gas station
should come if that man

122
00:09:49,643 --> 00:09:52,806
Let them know that
we're stranded, okay?

123
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:54,173
Yeah...

124
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:56,740
That man...

125
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:57,776
Huh?

126
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,081
He might have just run off...

127
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:02,489
Dear...

128
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,780
That can't be.

129
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:07,394
I think he's a nice person.

130
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:09,062
I wonder about that...

131
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:10,523
Huh?

132
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,573
What a beautiful sky...

133
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:27,811
I've heard enough about
the setting sun.

134
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:30,744
I've seen enough of it.

135
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:33,947
Oh, I'm not talking about
the setting sun.

136
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:36,252
That's already gone...

137
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:42,924
Take a look. Look at the color
of the sky where the sun set...

138
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:45,291
Yeah.

139
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:51,434
I wonder if Robert is
looking at this sky.

140
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:54,900
Oh my...

141
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:56,743
That's...

142
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:01,608
Say, take a look at that.

143
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,580
Someone is coming...

144
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:11,590
Oh, look.
I knew it.

145
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:18,393
Look...I knew it...

146
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,042
I borrowed gas and a lamp
from a nearby farmer.

147
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:32,012
Oh my...

148
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:33,611
See, Dear?

149
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:29,233
Ah... That was delicious,
wasn't it, Dear?

150
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:34,508
We were able to eat
a spectacular meal

151
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:36,873
because we had the menu translated
from German.

152
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:38,204
Right?

153
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,443
Especially that wine.

154
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,372
Forster Ungeheuer.

155
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:45,552
It's from the Palatinate region.

156
00:12:45,786 --> 00:12:48,949
Yes!! And that liver dish.

157
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:50,381
Liver Knödel!

158
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:51,848
Yes, that.

159
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:54,725
Ah, I'm so glad!!

160
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:58,055
If you weren't around,
we would have passed by

161
00:12:58,132 --> 00:13:00,464
the nice parts of Germany
without knowing it!

162
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:01,861
It was nothing...

163
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,499
Thank you as well
for paying for dinner.

164
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,274
Dieter, do you want more ice cream?

165
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:11,472
No, that's fine.

166
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:14,240
Do you think this guy is the culprit?

167
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:15,174
Huh?

168
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,784
This man on trial accused of
murdering his wife.

169
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,958
What do you think?

170
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:28,487
Well...who knows?

171
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:31,425
Though I may not look it...

172
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:34,661
I had quite a few exploits
when I was a detective.

173
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:35,828
Oh...

174
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:37,761
Honestly...

175
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:41,339
Bragging at a time like this...

176
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:42,401
Well...

177
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:47,072
When I saw a person,
I could usually tell whether or not

178
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:50,606
he was the culprit...
or a bad person.

179
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:52,681
O-Oh.

180
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:54,748
Stop that already.

181
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:57,055
Did you have too much wine to drink?

182
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,417
But...

183
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,393
After a while, I couldn't tell.

184
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:10,136
Good and bad people...
Guilty and innocent people...

185
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,864
I no longer could tell the difference.

186
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,343
Well, it means that
I wasn't much of a detective.

187
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,446
Indeed... I must have
drank too much wine.

188
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:34,851
What was the name of this wine?

189
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:37,620
It's Ungeheuer.

190
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,428
It's delicious.

191
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:20,366
My...how cute...

192
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:25,910
I hope you make a lot of friends
at your new place.

193
00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:28,441
Huh?

194
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:30,674
Yes...that would be nice.

195
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:37,554
Everyone has a happy childhood...
How nostalgic...

196
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:38,717
Yeah.

197
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:45,723
Whoops. Oh no.

198
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:55,373
It should be around here.

199
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:56,800
What should?

200
00:15:58,045 --> 00:15:59,171
Here, Dear...

201
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,977
Sorry, but I'm going to take a detour...

202
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:06,978
Go right ahead.

203
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:19,633
Ah...here it is.

204
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:24,204
<i>The police?!</i>

205
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:45,755
I'll be right back. You wait in the car.

206
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:51,362
W-What are we going to do,
Tenma–?

207
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,667
Tenma...let's run away.

208
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:32,164
What's wrong?

209
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:36,206
Someone's parked in
the officers' parking spaces again.

210
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:37,539
He appears to be a foreigner...

211
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:39,470
Oh well...

212
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:49,289
What should we do?

213
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:30,563
Umm... We want to get to Freiham.

214
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:33,999
You're going in
the opposite direction.

215
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:35,261
Oh...

216
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,030
Sorry, it won't take long.

217
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:42,335
I just want to go to
Steinbach Castle for a bit.

218
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,977
Dear...

219
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:45,942
Steinbach Castle?

220
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,280
There's something I want to see.

221
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,009
Are you all right?

222
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:19,341
Yes, thank you...

223
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:35,957
My son wrote in his letter...

224
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:36,989
Huh?

225
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,927
The view from this castle
is wonderful.

226
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:42,796
He said that he wanted to
show it to us.

227
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:45,667
Oh...is your son here?

228
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:50,041
We're going to go see him.

229
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:52,334
But we keep taking detours...

230
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,254
Wow...

231
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:08,460
He was looking at this view...

232
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,932
My son...

233
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,764
My son...

234
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:23,736
...killed a man...

235
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:28,342
We came to this country to see him.

236
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,326
We'll be going from here.

237
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:45,589
Thank you very much.

238
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:46,625
It was nothing.

239
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,860
I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

240
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,696
Huh?!

241
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:53,366
Thank you...take care.

242
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:01,173
What a nice man.

243
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:08,043
Yeah... He's wanted
on suspicion of multiple homicide.

244
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:09,048
Huh?!

245
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:11,720
It can't be! That man?!!

246
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:12,584
No...

247
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:14,026
I'm sure of it.

248
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:16,758
I saw his wanted poster earlier.

249
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,297
But...

250
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,691
His picture was posted
in the police station

251
00:21:21,768 --> 00:21:25,796
when we went to greet the detective
who arrested Robert earlier today.

252
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:29,772
I can't believe it... That nice man...

253
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,075
Yeah... I was suspicious
when I saw his picture earlier.

254
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:38,383
And I met him to confirm that...

255
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:40,547
...he's innocent!

256
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:43,456
He's not a bad man.

257
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:52,356
Robert...my son has committed
a murder...

258
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:56,635
I couldn't even tell anything
about my own family.

259
00:21:57,137 --> 00:22:00,368
When I realized that,
I quit my job as a detective.

260
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:04,703
But...

261
00:22:05,478 --> 00:22:08,971
I'll try to have confidence
in my eyes once more.

262
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:14,854
Robert committed a crime,
but he's not a bad man.

263
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:22,823
Now...let's go see Robert.
