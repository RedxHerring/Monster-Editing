1
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:08,522
The key...

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,356
Huh?

3
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:15,334
The key...the card...
the pin number...

4
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:21,203
I have my experiment data
and the tape in a safe box.

5
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:22,802
Tape?

6
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:26,573
A tape of an interview...
with a certain boy.

7
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:33,950
He's the monster that led
511 Kinderheim to destruction.

8
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:14,455
This room.

9
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:21,756
Inspector Zeman,
I brought him.

10
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,556
Huh?

11
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:27,460
Inspector?

12
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:29,032
Hm? Ah...

13
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,064
Ow, ow...

14
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:37,701
Oh, this is the person who discovered
the murder scene yesterday.

15
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,140
Yes. Mr. Grimmer.

16
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:43,116
Sorry for keeping you
at the station overnight.

17
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:47,149
I dropped my nail clipper
under my desk.

18
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,590
I'm big, so I bump
into everything.

19
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:56,594
Oh? You're pretty big, too!

20
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:59,265
Yes. I bump into everything.

21
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:03,035
I'm Zeman.
I'm in charge of this case.

22
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:04,304
I'm Grimmer.

23
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:06,462
Please have a seat.

24
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:10,609
Sorry, but I was in the middle of
cutting my nails when you came in,

25
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:12,009
so I'm going to finish them.

26
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,272
Oh, go right ahead.

27
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:15,879
My wife nags me.

28
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,776
Huh?

29
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:20,264
Whenever my nails grow out,
she doesn't like it

30
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:23,349
when I have the white part
of my nails showing.

31
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:27,418
Thanks to her,
I always cut them too deeply.

32
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:28,488
Oh...

33
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:31,955
It must have been
terrible yesterday.

34
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:32,992
Yeah.

35
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:35,699
Who would have thought
that would happen?

36
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:40,072
You're a freelance journalist,
aren't you?

37
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,708
Did you know of
the victim's past?

38
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,676
Mikhail Ivanovich Pedrov...

39
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:52,381
His real name was Reinhart Biermann.
He was German.

40
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:56,353
After the German reunification,
he was accused of various counts of

41
00:03:56,424 --> 00:04:00,691
suppression of human rights,
illegal detention and child abuse.

42
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:05,433
He escaped to the Czech Republic
after the Wall fell.

43
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:11,595
The German government
upheld the charges against him,

44
00:04:11,672 --> 00:04:15,734
but we let him remain free and
kept him under surveillance.

45
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,377
Surveillance?

46
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:18,438
That's right.

47
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:20,737
We kept an eye on him
and some troublemakers

48
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:23,079
from the former Czechoslovakian
secret police.

49
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:24,979
Secret police?

50
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,681
You know how terrifying
their restriction on free speech

51
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,350
and thought was during
the Cold War, don't you?

52
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,226
They also lent their support

53
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:37,287
to the terrorist activities
of extreme left organizations.

54
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:41,062
The Czech Republic
and Slovakia's split

55
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:45,072
and democratization
were done peacefully,

56
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,871
so they were able to go
underground without being indicted.

57
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:52,574
Pedrov was contacting them.

58
00:04:55,149 --> 00:05:00,553
He was probably selling them
the information he had.

59
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:01,247
Ow!

60
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,494
Look at that.
I've cut my nail to the quick.

61
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:11,831
Oh yeah...
Did you see a woman?

62
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,926
Woman?

63
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:19,801
It seems that Pedrov's murderer
was a woman...

64
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:21,433
and quite a beautiful one.

65
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:25,006
The children said that she passed by
in front of their house.

66
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:28,143
But I...didn't notice her.

67
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:30,373
I see...

68
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:32,686
Those children...

69
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:37,590
What's going to happen to the orphans
that Mr. Pedrov was in charge of?

70
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,355
Right now, we're keeping
them at the station,

71
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:45,662
but, today, several are going to
be taken to various orphanages.

72
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:47,560
I see...

73
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:51,563
It must have been terrible
to get dragged into all of this.

74
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:52,632
Not at all.

75
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:57,139
Come to think of it, what kind of
information are you gathering?

76
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,282
Oh... Well, various things that
you talked about concerning Pedrov.

77
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:06,879
Did he tell you anything?

78
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:09,688
No. Before he could he...

79
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:11,625
All right, that's perfect!

80
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:15,521
Now my wife won't
get mad at me.

81
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:20,493
You can go now.

82
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:22,931
I'm sorry for holding you
here for such a long time.

83
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:24,397
It's all right.

84
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:28,234
Oh.

85
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:35,346
Before he died,
did Mr. Pedrov say any last words?

86
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:37,376
No.

87
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:48,452
Mirosraph... Joseph...
And where's Tomáš?

88
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:50,390
Here.

89
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:55,964
You're all here.
Now get in the van!

90
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:05,405
Hurry up. Get in!

91
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:20,788
Next!
Three to Winovlady Care Center!

92
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:23,696
Honza, Antonín, Izzy!

93
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:24,924
Here.

94
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:27,793
It'll be sad.

95
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:31,736
You all got along well
and are being pulled apart.

96
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:38,443
But even if you're apart,
you're all under the same sky!

97
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:43,981
The day will come when
you can all play soccer together.

98
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,380
Cheer up! Antonín,
you're the leader, aren't you?

99
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,251
You can still send
letters to everyone!

100
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,955
Take charge of that
and cheer everyone up!

101
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:55,788
Okay.

102
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:58,524
All right. That's the spirit!

103
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:44,344
Kam jdete pane?

104
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:48,243
Huh? Oh... Hotel Kafka...

105
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:52,081
Oh, wait, before that,
go to Procházka Bank.

106
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:55,951
Banka procházka
je na cestě k hotel...

107
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:03,829
Umm... I don't know Czech really well.
Could you speak in German or English?

108
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:06,161
Hezkej den źe ano?

109
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,430
Why are you stopping?
We're still not...

110
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:15,342
Kam to bude, pane?

111
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:18,703
Dovezte mě do průmyslový
zóny svoboda!

112
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:25,377
Hey, give me a warning if you're
going to let on any other passengers!

113
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:29,248
Dival jste se včera na
fotbalový zápas v televizi?

114
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,515
Ano ovšem ale byl
jsem velice zklamán.

115
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,064
U-Umm...

116
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:49,604
Why are we going to
the outskirts of town?

117
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:54,878
I want to go to
a hotel in the city.

118
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,086
The key.

119
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:00,079
Huh?

120
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:01,980
The key.

121
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:04,450
W-What are you talking about?

122
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,169
Ta nám ale nedělá starosti.

123
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:44,323
Neboj se!

124
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,025
Nepust' ho!

125
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:06,086
Well...

126
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:08,079
Are you all right?

127
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,726
I thought you might be in danger,
so I followed you.

128
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,586
Are you hurt? Are you all right?

129
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:22,035
Inspector...

130
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:25,768
They were probably agents
of the former secret police.

131
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,632
Did they want
anything from you?

132
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:30,907
N-No. Not really.

133
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:34,913
I don't think they'd do this
for no reason.

134
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,042
No, they really didn't...

135
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:40,679
Are you hiding something?

136
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:42,849
N-No.

137
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,358
You must know why
they did this to you.

138
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:49,694
N-No, I really don't.

139
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:55,530
Then did you already take it from
the safe deposit box at the bank?

140
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:56,529
Huh?

141
00:11:58,138 --> 00:11:58,764
The tape.

142
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:02,942
The tape recording.

143
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:10,744
They're looking for the roots.

144
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,248
They're looking for the roots?

145
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,319
The monster's roots.

146
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,284
It would sell for a lot.

147
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:22,129
M-Monster?

148
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,194
We'll know when
we hear the tape.

149
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:30,736
We'll know where in the Czech Republic
the monster's mother is!

150
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:38,845
Oh, hello?

151
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:40,137
This is Inspector Zeman.

152
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:42,982
The suspect who robbed
the supermarket...

153
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:44,976
Did he give up his accomplice?

154
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,348
I see. Good work,
Detective Suk.

155
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:53,989
Me? I still have something
I have to do.

156
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:58,756
Yeah. I'll return to the station
in about an hour. See you later!

157
00:13:12,513 --> 00:13:15,539
If you don't leave it at that,
he won't be able to talk.

158
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:22,753
Do you feel like talking now?

159
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:26,888
Where's the key?

160
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:36,027
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

161
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:38,769
Why you...
- Now, hold on.

162
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:43,070
Mr. Grimmer, there's no reason
for you to hide it from us.

163
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,377
Where's the safety deposit key
you received from Pedrov?

164
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:54,150
I-I told you, I can't tell you
what I don't know.

165
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:57,757
I see. You want money.

166
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,618
I'll make you a deal.
How much do you want for it?

167
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,034
I'm a third-rate journalist, but thankfully,
I don't have to worry about not eating.

168
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:11,965
Mr. Grimmer...

169
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:17,041
This is no good.
Your nails are so long!

170
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:24,647
I told you, didn't I? My wife nags me
whenever my nails are long.

171
00:14:34,962 --> 00:14:39,490
Whoa! You shouldn't move
or I'll cut your nails too deeply.

172
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:49,374
Where is it? Where's the key?

173
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:52,138
Where is it?

174
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:57,173
Even if you were to open the bank's
safe deposit box with the key

175
00:14:57,251 --> 00:15:02,087
and get the tape and the data,
neither would be of use to you.

176
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,122
That tape is important
to their organization.

177
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:13,456
They're trying to revive
the Eastern realm!

178
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:19,930
The identity of the monster
is recorded on that tape.

179
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:23,005
They need that monster.

180
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:31,141
That monster can unite them.

181
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,150
The graduates of
511 Kinderheim.

182
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:42,025
The graduates of 511 Kinderheim

183
00:15:42,095 --> 00:15:46,259
were raised in East Germany
to be elite communists.

184
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,391
He can summon them.

185
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:50,796
They are the most
select group out there.

186
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:58,572
It is said that he was able to control
all of 511 Kinderheim and destroy it.

187
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:05,482
He's the only one who
can unite that elite group.

188
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,751
Now, where's the key?

189
00:16:16,597 --> 00:16:18,031
Elite Group?

190
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,129
What's so funny?!

191
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:34,573
What do you want?
I understand if you want money.

192
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:38,550
I'm a capitalist. I love money!

193
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,353
I just want to sell it to them
to make a lot of money.

194
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,357
Why are you doing this?

195
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:47,886
For social justice?

196
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:51,355
There's no reason
to go this far for that!

197
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:53,464
Who are you?

198
00:16:56,503 --> 00:16:59,473
You say you're a journalist
from the East Side,

199
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,134
but most of those people
were intelligence agents.

200
00:17:02,576 --> 00:17:05,273
At best they were spies.

201
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,106
Who sent you?

202
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:13,749
Are you just acting like 007?

203
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:16,148
All right.

204
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,124
Are you used to torture?!

205
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:32,468
You're really going to die.

206
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:36,671
This is your last chance!

207
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:38,067
Where's the key?

208
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:42,976
Do you know
the Magnificent Steiner?

209
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,657
It was a cartoon that aired
in West Germany in the 60's.

210
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:55,891
You could also watch it
in secret in East Berlin.

211
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:02,032
The main character was
a pretty weak guy.

212
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:10,736
But when he'd get into a predicament,
a secret friend would save him.

213
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:22,915
But that main character never realized
that this special friend was himself.

214
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:33,422
When the main character
got into a desperate situation,

215
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,563
he'd transform into
the terrifying Magnificent Steiner.

216
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:45,970
When he came to,
the evildoers were all defeated.

217
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:55,351
Then transform!
Transform right now!

218
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:12,998
Pour water on him.

219
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,453
He'll spit it out soon.
It's only a matter of time.

220
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,231
Who are you?

221
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:19,131
Huh?

222
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,286
A woman came in and...

223
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:45,659
A woman...came in and...

224
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,595
There was one gun shot.

225
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:56,193
One of the bodies was shot.

226
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:03,709
The other two bodies...
didn't have bullet holes.

227
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,926
The Magnificent Steiner...

228
00:22:29,135 --> 00:22:30,569
did it again.
