1
00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:09,029
He was discharged?!

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,095
Yes. Johan Liebert was
discharged this morning.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,690
I see...

4
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:20,769
I heard that he collapsed.
I guess it wasn't anything serious.

5
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:23,703
Oh?

6
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:26,313
You come to the library often.

7
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:29,278
You're the college's librarian...

8
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,853
I see... He was discharged.
Thank goodness.

9
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:37,214
I was worried about what
would happen to him.

10
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,927
You saw him collapse?

11
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:40,754
Yes.

12
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:45,489
He was looking for a book.
So I helped him look for one.

13
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:47,664
Then he suddenly collapsed?

14
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,701
Yes. He screamed.

15
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:51,872
Screamed?

16
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:54,567
He was holding a picture book.

17
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:57,077
And when he turned
the page like this...

18
00:00:58,346 --> 00:00:59,313
Picture book?

19
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:31,363
Shouldn't you rest a little more?

20
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:33,898
Then again,

21
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:35,875
there's nothing peculiar about
your brain or brainwaves.

22
00:02:36,244 --> 00:02:37,405
You're completely healthy!

23
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:41,574
The doctor said it was
probably anemia or fatigue.

24
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:44,949
Or that you experienced
some sort of shock.

25
00:02:45,186 --> 00:02:46,585
That's what he said anyway.

26
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:52,619
By the way, I didn't know that you have
scars on your head from a major surgery.

27
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,032
Anyway, for now, you should take
a break from work and studies and relax.

28
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:05,135
Oh yeah. You received a letter
while you were in the hospital.

29
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:06,800
A letter?

30
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:09,934
It's unsigned.

31
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:15,440
Well, I don't think it's a letter bomb.

32
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,427
What is it? What's so funny?

33
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,025
Who's it from?

34
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:32,431
It's from the Red Hindenburg.

35
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:33,760
Huh?

36
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:50,477
A pretty one's wandered in.

37
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:52,246
Are you lost?

38
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,049
Or is it your first time?

39
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:57,958
I'll be gentle. Come here.

40
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:01,228
Do you know
the Red Hindenburg?

41
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:02,188
Huh?

42
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:07,295
The Red Hindenburg said
that she was around this area.

43
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:12,904
You sure are into some
pretty freaky stuff for your age.

44
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:14,598
She's in the back.

45
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:27,252
Drugs... Give me drugs.

46
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:50,802
Is the Red Hindenburg up here?

47
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:15,926
Come in!

48
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:21,901
I'm glad you came.

49
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:25,042
Sit there.

50
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:38,650
Just look at that face.
It's very pretty.

51
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,228
I saw you on the TV news.

52
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:44,022
You were with Schuwald.

53
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:47,627
First you call yourself
Margot Langer...

54
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:50,762
and now you're going
by "Red Hindenburg"?

55
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:54,869
Before that it was "Blue Sophie."

56
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:57,141
But names don't matter.

57
00:05:57,778 --> 00:06:00,304
Isn't that right, Johan Liebert?

58
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:07,046
Anyway, that's what
my boyfriend calls me.

59
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:09,788
He's right behind that door.

60
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,020
Right, Dear?

61
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:17,126
So don't try anything funny.

62
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:20,891
He's on guard behind that door,
and he's got a big gun.

63
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:23,063
He's big in other places, too.

64
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:32,740
Excuse me.

65
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:37,176
You're really close to
that tycoon, Schuwald.

66
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:39,446
What an ingenious plan.

67
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:46,356
No, it's really impressive.

68
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:49,829
Before, you brought me
that Fahren boy.

69
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:55,759
But who would have thought that
Schuwald's real son would show up?!

70
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:59,863
I feel sorry for Fahren.

71
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:03,676
As soon as he wasn't of use,
he was forced to commit suicide.

72
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:07,472
Well, who knew that
it would take two years?

73
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:13,383
Two years ago, the real Margot Langer
died very conveniently.

74
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:20,689
Of course, she died and
I received quite a blessing.

75
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:31,500
I wasn't really close to her.

76
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:35,938
She's wasn't a prostitute!
She had already washed her hands.

77
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:38,871
I only went drinking with her
two or three times.

78
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,815
She never had anyone to talk to
for a long time, did she?

79
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:47,888
I'd get her drunk, act as if I was crying
and she'd talk on and on.

80
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:53,058
Her love affair with Schuwald...
How she left her son up for adoption...

81
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:56,423
But she was killed.

82
00:07:56,764 --> 00:08:02,464
Thanks to that, I became Margot Langer
and got a lot from Schuwald in her place.

83
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,937
When Margot was killed, the police
said it was the work of a phantom killer.

84
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:14,074
The police probably never knew
that such a plan was in the works.

85
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,673
Oh...That's right.

86
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:22,745
You did a pretty horrible thing
to Richard, that detective!

87
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:27,555
He never would have had to commit suicide
if he hadn't poked his nose into this.

88
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:36,896
Now then. How many people
have you killed?

89
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:44,174
All right... Let's end our fun little chat
and start negotiating.

90
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,940
You can't get away.
You have to give up!

91
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:49,372
Right, dear?!

92
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,748
Tell me, how much
will you give me?

93
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:02,621
Are you listening?

94
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:12,272
What do you think is
the most terrifying thing?

95
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:13,533
Huh?

96
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:17,837
I thought I had reached
the darkest place.

97
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,044
It's no use to change the subject.

98
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,744
But...beyond that...

99
00:09:27,288 --> 00:09:29,552
I saw an even blacker darkness.

100
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:31,451
Huh?

101
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:36,463
Hold on a second!

102
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:39,025
Do you think I'm just
going to let you leave?!

103
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:41,160
I've already given up.

104
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:45,033
I don't have anymore
interest in Schuwald.

105
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:47,098
Don't mess with me!

106
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:49,042
It's useless.

107
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:52,273
I'm someone who doesn't exist.

108
00:09:54,515 --> 00:09:56,074
Don't think you can
make a fool of me!

109
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:56,943
Dear!

110
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:58,481
Dear, come out!

111
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:22,566
D-Dear... W-What are you...
R-Roberto!

112
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:41,317
Could you give me a balloon?

113
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:56,602
Use this to buy some drugs.

114
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:20,162
Doctor, are you ready yet?
My head's bleeding!

115
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:21,258
What are you talking about?

116
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:23,929
My kid is first!
- It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

117
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:26,301
Shut up. Don't cry over
a little fracture.

118
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:30,776
Stop making a fuss and
sit and wait for your turn.

119
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:35,949
No matter how much noise you make,
there's only one doctor here.

120
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:44,990
What is that long pole-like thing?

121
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:47,554
Oh... Well, umm...

122
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:51,361
ls the doctor here a good doctor?

123
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:57,536
Of course! If this doctor weren't here,
all the Asians here would be dead.

124
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:59,232
Especially the Vietnamese.

125
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,998
I see.

126
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:04,202
You're not Vietnamese, are you?

127
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:05,245
Y-Yeah...

128
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,745
Hey, wait in line! You look sickly,
but the injured come first.

129
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:13,780
Well, I'm not a patient, so...

130
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:17,057
Hey, sit down and wait!

131
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,425
Hurry and see me, doctor!

132
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:20,983
My kid is first!

133
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:22,195
Excuse me.

134
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:23,430
What is it?

135
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:24,965
Hey, stay in line!

136
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:28,495
Excuse me...Doctor!
There's something I want to ask you.

137
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:31,129
How many times do I have to say this?!
Wait outside!

138
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:33,841
I don't have the time for this!

139
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,208
<i>A woman...
and what's more...</i>

140
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:41,205
Didn't you hear me?! Get out!

141
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:44,381
<i>This Doctor...
How old is she?</i>

142
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,649
I'm suturing this wound,
so don't interfere.

143
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:51,920
If something happens to this patient,
it'll be your fault!

144
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,921
<i>A stab to the thigh...</i>

145
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:56,757
<i>It's from a knife.</i>

146
00:12:58,232 --> 00:12:59,700
<i>Her suturing is very clean.</i>

147
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:01,294
<i>But...</i>

148
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,631
You should insert a drainage tube.

149
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,729
Don't talk next to me!

150
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:10,775
If not, you should take him
to a real hospital.

151
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:14,179
A real hospital?!
This is a rea–

152
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:15,272
This is not a hospital.

153
00:13:17,284 --> 00:13:20,185
I can tell that you're
not a real doctor.

154
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:24,319
I would have taken him to
a real hospital if I could.

155
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:29,295
Most of the people here are
illegal immigrants or illegal overstayers.

156
00:13:30,297 --> 00:13:33,358
If they went to a real hospital,
they'd be sent to prison.

157
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,894
And deported to
their native countries!

158
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:40,198
How many people here
do you think have died

159
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:41,935
because they couldn't get
to a real hospital?

160
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,377
Don't talk as if you know anything!

161
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:49,409
Insert a drainage tube.

162
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:50,343
Huh?

163
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:52,982
He probably got stabbed
with a dirty knife.

164
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:57,082
If you don't insert a drainage tube,

165
00:13:57,424 --> 00:14:00,689
the wound will fester
and an abscess will form!

166
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:02,195
O-Okay!

167
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:03,986
Remove one or two stitches.

168
00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:05,291
Okay!

169
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,093
Insert the drainage tube
about five centimeters in.

170
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:31,482
All right. It went well.

171
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:35,191
All right, who's my next patient?

172
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:57,250
You've regained consciousness.

173
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:09,421
Your patients tell me that you had
been treating them for 48 hours straight.

174
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:13,359
I checked on the other
patients' post-operative status.

175
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:16,436
You're pretty good for
an unlicensed doctor.

176
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:18,566
How old are you?

177
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:21,200
17.

178
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:24,409
I'm surprised. You're so young.

179
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:27,404
You have the skill of
a practicing physician.

180
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:34,382
By chance, the doctor who did business
here disappeared and left his tools.

181
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:38,015
This isn't something you can do
just by holding the right tools.

182
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:40,786
Where did you learn your skills?

183
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:43,822
My father...was a doctor.

184
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:45,357
Was?

185
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,559
My father was a Vietnamese doctor.

186
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:51,231
He took me with him when
he came to study in East Germany.

187
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:55,198
He stayed and opened a clinic.

188
00:15:56,276 --> 00:15:57,710
But the Wall was destroyed.

189
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:03,674
Even so, he tried to help
Asian immigrants to the best of his ability.

190
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:05,785
That's when...

191
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:12,491
my father was killed by a thug
who called himself a Neo-nazi.

192
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:19,025
He was killed...just because
he had a different skin color.

193
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,269
I became an orphan and
was sent to an orphanage.

194
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,909
Afterwards, I was adopted
by a German family.

195
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:36,982
But they only adopted me
in the spirit of social service.

196
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:40,648
I was just a poor yellow-skinned girl.

197
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:43,384
So I ran away.

198
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,388
I helped my father as a child.

199
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,597
I read a lot of the books
he left behind.

200
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:56,831
I decided that I would do
what my father tried to do.

201
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:00,035
Out of the way!
I'll do the rest.

202
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:02,265
There we go.

203
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,700
Don't do anything reckless
if you want it to heal quickly.

204
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:05,671
Okay.

205
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:09,208
All right, next patient.

206
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:10,945
I saw most of them.

207
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:16,484
You should go back home
and study.

208
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:20,194
This country will provide opportunities
for those who want to learn.

209
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:24,293
I guess you're a real doctor.

210
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:27,491
Are you saying that amateurs
should stand aside?!

211
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:29,827
That's not what I'm saying.

212
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,437
I just...

213
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:34,806
If I'm gone, what'll happen
to the people here?!

214
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:36,767
Who's going to take care of them?!

215
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,302
Well... I just...

216
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:42,479
Mommy!

217
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:43,750
W-What's wrong?!

218
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:47,951
My p-pimp suddenly snapped.

219
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:49,683
H-He shot m–

220
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:53,491
Mommy!

221
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:55,823
She was shot and
walked all the way here?!

222
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:59,288
Mommy said that
you could fix her!

223
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:00,894
W-Well...

224
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:04,433
Save her!
Please save Mommy!

225
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:05,939
All right.

226
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:07,804
It's all right!
Leave it to me!

227
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,567
I'm counting on you, Doctor!

228
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,273
She's a prostitute from this town.

229
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:18,179
This kind of thing always happens
to these kinds of people.

230
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,781
I'd like to help her,
but this is impossible!

231
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,889
I'm getting her on the operating table.
Carry that side!

232
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:30,959
It's impossible! We've got to
take her to a real hospital!

233
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:33,663
If we carry her to a hospital right now,
it'll be too late!

234
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:35,928
I know my limits!

235
00:18:36,303 --> 00:18:37,532
This is too much for me!

236
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:39,001
Don't give up until the end!

237
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:45,035
As long as the patient's breathing,
don't give up hope until the very end!

238
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:48,773
Don't give up hope!

239
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,655
If the artery in her abdominal cavity
had been damaged...

240
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:58,217
Her blood pressure would
have immediately plummeted,

241
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,656
and she would have
gone into shock.

242
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:03,360
But she walked all the way here.

243
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:05,232
It means that her blood pressure
dropped gradually,

244
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:06,697
and she's in pre-shock.

245
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:10,195
From the look of her bullet wound,

246
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,432
there's a big possibility that
her spleen is damaged.

247
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:15,899
In other words, we can perform
an emergency abdominal operation

248
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:17,569
while we do a blood transfusion.

249
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:20,105
Now let's begin.

250
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:22,782
Take the scalpel.

251
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:47,170
Well, he fell asleep peacefully.

252
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,404
It's a miracle that she didn't suffer
any damage to her bones,

253
00:19:50,477 --> 00:19:53,208
small and large intestines,
or any part of the digestive system.

254
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:56,873
We were lucky that all we had to do
was remove the damaged spleen.

255
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:00,649
It was a magnificent operation.

256
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:03,654
That's because you were here.

257
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:08,092
Mommy...

258
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:14,095
Dr. Tenma...

259
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:17,832
Stay here.

260
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:26,240
I came here to ask you something.

261
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:28,873
This newspaper article...

262
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,644
Blue Sophie"' also known as
the "Red Hindenburg"...

263
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:39,252
I heard that you were
the first person at the murder scene.

264
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,086
Yes.

265
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:46,131
Could you tell me what it was like?

266
00:20:50,504 --> 00:20:54,202
That night, I received a call
from one of the townspeople.

267
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:58,934
She was shot in the head.
She died instantly.

268
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,508
I've seen scenes
like that many times.

269
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,180
But that was a first.

270
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:09,947
The feeling I felt
as I entered the room...

271
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:13,755
It wasn't a robbery.
It wasn't revenge.

272
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,630
It was just a murder.

273
00:21:23,236 --> 00:21:23,862
Johan.

274
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:33,941
When you're in darkness,
you just sink deeper into it.

275
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:36,310
Shine some light.

276
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:43,252
Listen, study hard.
You can do it!

277
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:46,593
You can become a good doctor.

278
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:58,764
Wait. Where are you going,
Dr. Tenma?!

279
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:05,510
You...You look like someone who's
sinking deeper into darkness.

280
00:22:08,682 --> 00:22:11,549
You'll come back,
right, Dr. Tenma?!
