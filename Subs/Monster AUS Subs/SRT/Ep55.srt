1
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:08,991
Eva Heinemann?

2
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:10,825
Yeah, she came.

3
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:14,867
Even though she's ruined, her attitude
is still the same as it was before.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,132
No, it's gotten even worse.

5
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:22,543
Did she say where
she was staying?

6
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:27,707
Oh. She said she had no cash on
hand and told me to get it from her hotel.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,541
She probably still
thinks she's rich.

8
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:32,677
Which hotel was that?

9
00:00:33,788 --> 00:00:36,052
She said it was
the Steigent Hotel.

10
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:38,692
I wonder if she's really
going to pay her bill.

11
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:40,918
Staying at such
a third-rate hotel...

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,056
Huh?

13
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:47,358
You. .. Come to think of it.. .
you were engaged to her.

14
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,498
C-Come to think of it...

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,572
Oh. H-Hello?! Police?!

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,376
J-Just now.. .
That serial killer...

17
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:01,074
Hey!

18
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:01,775
Huh?

19
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:03,876
Do you know
where my coat is?

20
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:05,045
Huh?

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,855
I hung my coat
by the entrance.

22
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:08,949
Huh?

23
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:17,076
Hello?

24
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:19,175
Oh, is Eva.

25
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:23,091
A woman by the name of Eva
Heinemann should be staying there.

26
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,723
<i>Yes. I shall connect you
to her room.</i>

27
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,052
<i>Please wait one moment.</i>

28
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:28,621
Oh, okay.

29
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:35,295
Hurry.

30
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,866
Quickly.

31
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:48,915
<i>I was thinking of killing
your former fiancée...Eva Heinemann.</i>

32
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:50,543
Hurry!

33
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,177
<i>Thank you for waiting.</i>

34
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,854
<i>We called her,
but she's not picking up.</i>

35
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:59,353
Get me her room number.
Oh, no, umm...

36
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:04,028
I-I'd like to send her a fax,
could you tell me her room number?

37
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,023
Please! Tell me!

38
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:10,637
<i>She's in room 402.
Our fax number is...</i>

39
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,573
402...

40
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:36,428
It's no good. Mr. Baul isn't in his office
and isn't answering his cell phone.

41
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:40,693
Your partner won't come
no matter how long you wait.

42
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:49,167
I'm guessing that he became Tenma's
lawyer to win Tenma's innocence.

43
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:53,708
But Tenma made a complete
confession and, in the end, escaped.

44
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:59,278
He couldn't defend that,
so he's resigned as Tenma's counsel.

45
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:08,825
Are you going to quit too,
Mr. Verdemann?

46
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,227
I don't plan on doing that.

47
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,101
But it's a fact that
Tenma escaped.

48
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:18,536
Before he escaped, as his lawyer,
I wanted him to trust me.

49
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:23,270
Then do you believe in Tenma?

50
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:27,474
Do you believe what
happened in Munich?

51
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:31,843
Do you believe everything
that Tenma has said?

52
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:39,021
You don't believe any of it,
do you?

53
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,731
When I heard the news
that Tenma escaped,

54
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:47,359
I had the same reaction
as I did back then.

55
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:54,032
When he disappeared from us
and tried to shoot Johan...

56
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,969
Something's happening again.

57
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:00,747
That's why Tenma escaped.

58
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:03,745
Believe in him.

59
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:07,848
Just like the way that you believed
in your father and became a lawyer.

60
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:16,129
The telephone's just been ringing!

61
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:20,398
The media is in an uproar
about whether Verdemann,

62
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:23,529
the great lawyer,
will continue to defend Tenma.

63
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:26,065
Tell them I have no comment.

64
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:30,106
B-But that won't
calm the media.

65
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:37,177
Tell them that I'll hold a press
conference after I've reexamined the facts!

66
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,388
Until then, don't let
anyone into my office.

67
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:43,550
Oh, but you have a visitor.

68
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,626
What?

69
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:48,928
You let him in?!
I won't see anyone today!

70
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:52,562
O-Okay. I told him that
and tried to turn him away.

71
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:55,200
But he insisted that
he was going to wait here.

72
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:57,304
Who in the world is he?

73
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,806
W-Well, he's with the German
Federal Criminal Police Office.

74
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:02,876
The BKA?

75
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:11,883
<i>Over the Rainbow...</i>

76
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:13,879
Such a nice song.

77
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:19,325
I believe it was the theme song of
the radio station that your father ran.

78
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:20,991
Wh-Who are you?

79
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,225
My name is Lunge.

80
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,267
406...

81
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:30,304
405...

82
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,907
404.

83
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:44,879
Room 402...

84
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,087
That's her room.

85
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:58,322
Guten tag.

86
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:01,192
Oh. G-Guten tag.

87
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:17,543
Um...

88
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:18,444
Huh?

89
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,547
Where's the guest who
was staying here?

90
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:22,549
Huh?

91
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,954
Oh. I came to visit the guest
who was staying in this room.

92
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:30,822
Huh? Didn't this guest
check out already?

93
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:31,724
Huh?

94
00:08:40,508 --> 00:08:42,772
See? There's no one
here anymore.

95
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:47,040
Eva.

96
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,440
Inspector Lunge...

97
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:55,165
Of all the reports on Tenma
I've seen during my investigation,

98
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:58,352
I've taken the closest
look at your report.

99
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,326
It's an elaborate report.

100
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:05,557
I've also heard rumors about you,
Mr. Verdemann.

101
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,795
You're a hero in
the legal world.

102
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:12,100
You've probably come here upon
hearing about Tenma's escape.

103
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:18,042
But unfortunately,
I have no information to give you.

104
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,743
Escape, huh?

105
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:25,878
No. Actually, I'm on a long
vacation at the moment.

106
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,650
In a way, my long vacation may
have been an escape as well.

107
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:37,896
Umm. .. Excuse me,
but I have no time for chit-chat.

108
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:46,003
Perhaps it is a long work habit, but
I can't freely travel without direction.

109
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:49,833
I end up making themes
for my travels.

110
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:55,809
The theme for this journey
is this picture book.

111
00:09:57,318 --> 00:10:02,484
Sorry. I don't have time.
Please leave.

112
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,120
No, let me talk a little longer.

113
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:07,854
You don't have anything
to say about Tenma?

114
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,295
I'm not here to
talk about Tenma.

115
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,526
Huh?

116
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:20,638
Besides, I only heard about
Tenma's escape on the way here.

117
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,004
Then why are you here?

118
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:25,403
As I said, this book...

119
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:29,777
I've become intensely interested in finding
out about the writer of this picture book.

120
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:34,253
But this writer has
had many pseudonyms.

121
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:38,652
Of them,
only Klaus Poppe was German.

122
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:41,227
I was curious
and as I investigated,

123
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:44,925
I came across someone
who was Poppe's acquaintance.

124
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,589
Someone?

125
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:50,493
Your father.

126
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:57,607
Your father's radio station had a
program called "The World's Fables."

127
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:02,048
According to records,
Poppe's work, "Where am I?"

128
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:04,278
Was aired in the August of '66.

129
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:08,656
I've seen records
of your father's trial.

130
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,593
It was the espionage case that
shook post-war West Germany.

131
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:16,252
So what about it?

132
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,461
Your father entered
Czechoslovakia several times.

133
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:25,328
He was just meeting with
a picture book artist,

134
00:11:25,406 --> 00:11:27,397
so it wasn't examined
or noticed at all.

135
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:29,634
What are you trying to say?

136
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:34,141
Well, I'm suggesting that your father
might have been old friends

137
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:35,842
with this picture book artist.

138
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,249
My father had many acquaintances
involved with his work.

139
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,179
He used to meet with countless
people to arrange programs.

140
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,954
So you're saying that
they weren't that close?

141
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:50,861
But according to my investigation,

142
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:55,095
Klaus Poppe usually met people
at his chief editor's house

143
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:59,606
or at his vacation home,
an old farm in the Czech suburbs.

144
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:04,402
But your father met with him
at a certain mansion.

145
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:05,946
A certain mansion?

146
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:10,107
It was called Red Rose Mansion.

147
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:15,651
Poppe never used the mansion
under the name Klaus Poppe.

148
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:23,660
When he used the mansion,
he called himself Franz Bonaparta.

149
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:30,796
He was someone with a very important
post in the Czechoslovakian Secret Police.

150
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:39,202
What are you...

151
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:41,473
What are you trying to say?!

152
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:49,288
Spy kid! Spy kid!
Spy kid! Spy kid!

153
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,786
Son of a traitor!

154
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,127
Son of a coward!

155
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:03,163
Hey! If you don't like that,
prove that he's innocent!

156
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:06,069
If the father's dirty,
the son's dirty, too!

157
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:13,847
Spy kid! Spy kid! Spy kid !
Spy kid! Spy kid! Spy kid! Spy kid!

158
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:20,283
<i>I just want to learn
about Franz Bonaparta.</i>

159
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:22,151
I know of no such person!

160
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:25,683
<i>In Czechoslovakia in '66,</i>

161
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,027
<i>your father met Klaus Poppe
at a certain mansion, didn't he?</i>

162
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:33,999
A picture book artist and
the owner of a radio station.

163
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:36,126
That's all they were!

164
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:39,629
<i>When he went by
the name Klaus Poppe,</i>

165
00:13:39,707 --> 00:13:42,642
<i>he never used
the Red Rose Mansion.</i>

166
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,771
What are you trying to say?!

167
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:49,806
<i>When he met your father
at the Red Rose Mansion,</i>

168
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:55,845
<i>he wasn't meeting him as Klaus
Poppe, but as Franz Bonaparta.</i>

169
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,820
<i>As someone who was important to
the Czechoslovakian Secret Police.</i>

170
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:02,751
That's a false charge!

171
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:08,767
<i>I don't care whether or not
your father was a spy.</i>

172
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:10,635
My father wasn't a spy!

173
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:17,005
<i>Your father should have known
who Franz Bonaparta really was.</i>

174
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:18,311
He's not involved!

175
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:24,382
<i>Your father knew what went on in
the Red Rose Mansion, didn't he?</i>

176
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:25,278
No!

177
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:26,378
No!

178
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,749
My father is innocent! No!

179
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:30,156
No!

180
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,950
<i>Contact me when
you feel like talking.</i>

181
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:40,293
<i>I'll keep on saying it: I don't care if
your father was a spy or not.</i>

182
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:46,700
<i>I just want to learn
about Franz Bonaparta.</i>

183
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:53,680
My father is...

184
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:55,606
My father is...

185
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,954
Mr. Verdemann,
you have a call from your wife.

186
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,824
What's wrong?

187
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:05,951
Nothing.

188
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:13,532
Umm... Your wife is
calling from the hospital.

189
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:14,827
Okay.

190
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:26,138
Hello?

191
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:30,713
I see. You're finally getting out, huh?
That's good.

192
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,083
Yeah. All right.

193
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:35,651
I'll come and
pick you up right now.

194
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:57,169
Tenma!

195
00:15:57,678 --> 00:15:58,645
Drive the car!

196
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:01,574
C-Calm down.
Listen to me.

197
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:02,774
Drive the car, quickly!

198
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:05,577
Quickly!

199
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:16,156
You'll understand if we talk.
Anyway, calm down, Tenma.

200
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:17,430
Tell me what you have to say.

201
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:18,698
Where's Eva?

202
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:19,391
Huh?

203
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,263
Where is Eva Heinemann?!

204
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:23,300
W-What are you talking about?

205
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:25,772
What about Eva Heinemann?

206
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,240
Don't act dumb!

207
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:30,043
I know what you guys
are trying to do!

208
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:31,411
"You guys"?

209
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:35,007
Don't stop the car.
Look ahead and keep going!

210
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:39,680
I know that you're
both after Eva's life!

211
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,349
"Eva's life"?

212
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:43,766
"You guys"?

213
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,757
Don't play dumb!

214
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:46,159
Your partner...

215
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:49,062
You're partners
with that man, Baul!

216
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:50,363
Baul?

217
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:54,123
He's the man I shot at the library
at the University of Munich!

218
00:16:56,603 --> 00:17:01,473
I won't allow any more casualties.
Answer me! Where is Eva?!

219
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,875
It all began when
I saved Johan's life.

220
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:10,010
He's taken many lives
since then.

221
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,251
Many, many lives.

222
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,681
I've had enough!

223
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:17,056
I won't let there
be any more victims.

224
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,150
Don't stop the car!

225
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:23,362
Is that true?

226
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,355
I said, "Move the car!"

227
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,228
Is it true,
what you just said?

228
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:31,571
Is it true?!
Can I trust you?!

229
00:17:40,614 --> 00:17:44,744
My father...
was suspected of espionage.

230
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:49,851
Afterwards,
I proved his innocence.

231
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:53,186
But he really was a spy.

232
00:17:57,431 --> 00:18:02,995
I believed in my father's innocence
and studied hard to become a lawyer.

233
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:06,963
But I found something
when I was a student.

234
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:11,300
Decisive proof that
my father was a spy...

235
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,046
Ever since then...

236
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:17,885
Ever since then,
I could never believe in anyone.

237
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,547
"The great, crusading lawyer?!"

238
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:23,879
"The hero of the legal world?!"

239
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:28,154
Don't make me laugh. A man
who doesn't believe in anyone...

240
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:35,765
I really was the son of a spy.

241
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,168
Ever since I found
that notebook...

242
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:48,377
Ever since I found that notebook
that my father had written in the 60's.

243
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,796
As I flipped through
the pages of that notebook,

244
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,814
everything I had believed
about my father crumbled.

245
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:01,621
There was no mistake.
My father was a spy.

246
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:12,229
The notebook had records of contact
with the Czechoslovakian Secret Police,

247
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:14,273
written in
an indecipherable code.

248
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:20,271
The mysterious people that my father
contacted included Franz Bonaparta.

249
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:24,113
Was something about the Red
Rose Mansion written in there?

250
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:26,545
How do you know about that?

251
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:28,882
So that's it.

252
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:30,049
Huh?

253
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:35,686
That man, Baul, probably got close
to you so he could get that notebook.

254
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:38,456
Where is that notebook
right now?

255
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:40,864
At my house.

256
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,277
This is bad.

257
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:56,481
There's no mistake.
He was after your father's notebook.

258
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,047
It's a letter addressed to you.

259
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:07,621
He predicted that
you would come here.

260
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:13,500
"Help me, Kenzo.
Help me, Kenzo."

261
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:16,527
"Come quickly to
the Red Rose Mansion."

262
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:18,703
Does this mean
that Eva's safe?

263
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:20,532
No.

264
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:23,604
This isn't her handwriting.

265
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:28,139
He's toying.. .
He's toying with me.

266
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:36,348
It's safe.

267
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:39,886
It's in the pile of old records.

268
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:42,323
<i>Over the Rainbow.</i>

269
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,292
This is the notebook.

270
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:49,302
Take it.

271
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:54,199
But if someone gets it,
your father will...

272
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:57,704
I don't need it anymore.

273
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:20,355
Can I trust you?

274
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:24,101
What you told me...

275
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:27,129
What you're doing...

276
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:30,568
I can't be of any help.

277
00:21:31,244 --> 00:21:34,179
But can I trust you, Dr. Tenma?

278
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:43,848
You shouldn't trust anyone, who
carries one of these around, too much.

279
00:21:59,873 --> 00:22:01,068
<i>I want to believe.</i>
