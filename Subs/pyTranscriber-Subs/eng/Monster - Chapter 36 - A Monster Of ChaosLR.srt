1
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,872
Has there been any change in his condition

2
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,272
Well up no but doctor and his pulse and blood pressure

3
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
Dr Tim

4
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,856
What about mayor Rodgers operation

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
Let's begin the surgery

6
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
Right

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
Wait

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,024
What's our patient's name

9
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,608
I want to know the boy's name

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Well

11
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
We don't even know his name

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,616
It's all right

13
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,640
Hang in there

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
I'll save you

15
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
We have a problem those kids TW

16
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
Did you search the entire hospital I already checked

17
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
But they're both gone maybe they're off playing hide and seek or something like that

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,984
They're off playing hide and seek

19
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
Something like that

20
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
Something like that

21
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
Scaredy kitchen

22
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,936
Where you hiding at this time get out here you big baby

23
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
Keep it up and you're going to pee your pants again just like last time

24
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
It's getting

25
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,320
Play kids time for everybody to head on home okay

26
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
All right later okay

27
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Wait I'm still here

28
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920
Hold on guys I was right here all this time

29
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:36,320
I want someone find me already please I'm right

30
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,184
Come find me

31
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Scaredy

32
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
That man who stopped by earlier this evening he's still standing in front of the main gate sir

33
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,943
How should I proceed who is he

34
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
He said he was Richard Brown psychologist

35
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,319
Brown being that private detective you hired

36
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,279
I'll just go at check them from the premises sir my son I need you to tell me what

37
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:58,655
Say when you look at this man right he's short and older

38
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
What about his character look deeper I think he's a good person I couldn't tell you

39
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Tell you why

40
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
And now I'm staring into his eyes and a desperate man is staring back at me

41
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,087
I understand

42
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,071
Thank you for agreeing to see me Mr chevald

43
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
I know it's late

44
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,167
Well thanks a wasted on me doctor

45
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
My patients run short

46
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,335
Speak your peace and be on your way I agree let's cut right to the chase

47
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,431
You'll be happy to know the length of this conversation depends entirely on you

48
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,015
I'm assuming you came here to talk about the boy

49
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
About joh

50
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,511
Yeah silence speaks volumes doctor

51
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
I knew this day would come eventually that sooner or later someone like you would knock on my door

52
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:10,335
And maybe shed some light on the grand mystery mystery how

53
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,735
A person could ever be that perfect I

54
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
Imagine having one site just confuses the matter but I can always sense it yes the

55
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
So something so unerringly precise like Johan I feel as though he's not of this world

56
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
Not at all I do oh he's very much of this world I assure you and he's left a paper trail

57
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
Just like the rest of us and here it is

58
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,871
I'll read these now with your permission trust me is imperfections Run Deep

59
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
It all started back in 1986 when a nearly dead young boy was rushed to the emergency room

60
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,927
Social dwarf with a gunshot wound to the Head

61
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,143
And that's when he started up as one of your student readers

62
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,239
My murdered friend Richard had a theory

63
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:16,639
He theorized that Johan was the one who put the foreign boy up to pretending to be your son in the first place

64
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
It worked

65
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,295
Damn well but then you're real son entered the picture and Johan changed plans

66
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
He quickly latched on to Carl

67
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
And foreign was a loose end

68
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
He put far enough to one last thing

69
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
Suicide

70
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,351
Sir how did you come to be reunited with your long lost

71
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
It's Quite a feat after all this time

72
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,031
I want you to think very carefully about how many people close to you have died over the last few years

73
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,103
The driver who had worked for you so unfailingly

74
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
The maid who read books to you

75
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
The accounted with whom you'd go bird watching

76
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
Dead

77
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
Every last one of them

78
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
Yo Yohan murdered them all don't you see that

79
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
To create an empty space in your heart and then fill it himself we have to drag that boy's evil into the light of day but

80
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
But I can't do it without your help Mr shuvald

81
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
If we don't do something to stop Johan right now

82
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
Dr Tenma will

83
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,479
Didn't you say Johan toys with people is always playing with a line of ants taking Delight in

84
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,879
To him where nothing but insects

85
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
You must know what people call me

86
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
That Infamous nickname of my

87
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
Oh yes

88
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,375
The much feared vampire of Bavaria

89
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,727
I'll be straight with you that nickname please me very much

90
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:52,127
I'd push myself harder and harder never relenting and oh how it did grow

91
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,711
I would swell the monster inside me

92
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,831
But to whatever

93
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,695
They speak my name with such reverence but now I'm a withered husk

94
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:11,839
I too long to toy with people as though they were nothing more than a line of ants

95
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Just like this

96
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
I see that boy fast becoming the person I tried so hard to be

97
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,943
They worship the Dragon for he had given his authority to the Beast and they worship the Beast

98
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,295
Saying who is like the Beast and who can fight against it

99
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,599
The revelation of St John the Divine

100
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,623
Is it not

101
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,207
The only thing that can defeat the Beast

102
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,047
Would be a monster more fearsome than the first

103
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Father

104
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,367
What was that about you talked all night

105
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,231
Tell me Carl where's your heart

106
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,119
Oh he said he's heading straight to the ceremony after he wraps things up at Esther hoven's office

107
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
But father

108
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:23,007
You're looking pretty worn out if you want me to cancel your appearance I will

109
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,871
No let's get ready to go to the ceremony

110
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
You're not to blame

111
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:53,471
You did your job as a doctor and you did your best you are not to blame

112
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,943
Please live on and continue to save as many people as you are able to

113
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
That's a real

114
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,431
So you're going to call it quits huh

115
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,247
And just when you were really starting to get the hang of it

116
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Thanks again for the job sir

117
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,135
Well be sure to visit if you ever down this way

118
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Sure

119
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Well

120
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Goodbye

121
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,327
She was such a pleasant little thing too

122
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
Hello

123
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
May I speak to load of Frank please

124
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Oh I'm sorry

125
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
I

126
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
In that case

127
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,639
Could you let her know I'm leaving Munich on the 3:00 train

128
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
Yes of course

129
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,967
Oh and what was your name again de

130
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
It's Nina

131
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
Nina Fortner

132
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
The vampire is bavar

133
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
Out in the sun know this

134
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
He'll hear you

135
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:57,375
You have seen the guest list right of course that's a real Who's Who and not just a Bavaria

136
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,775
Business figures from all over Europe and Japan even ambassadors and government officials this is hardly a simple book

137
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:09,919
Donation ceremony wouldn't you agree yeah they say every move shoe called mix sends ripples throughout Europe

138
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,063
He plays the continency economy like a marionette this is his first public appearance and I don't know how long

139
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:21,951
They all turned out to see the legend in person Charities fine but donating his personal Library like this

140
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:28,351
Doesn't it seem a bit well final hey don't say that he's the Keystone of the EU

141
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
We can't have him calling it a day just yet

142
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Yes

143
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,359
I forgot some papers I need you to go retrieve them for me

144
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
Oh sure what kind of papers are they

145
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,223
Just go to the mansion and get them

146
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
They're on the desk in the study

147
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
But father you

148
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
Yohan will be here soon enough

149
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
Leave everything to him

150
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Okay

151
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,527
What's going on with the investigation inspector

152
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
Why it's proceeding smoothly

153
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,999
With my information I thought you were ready to exonerate him

154
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:34,399
But you haven't done a damn thing with it did you even bother to check on true Vault secretary Johan Liebert

155
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
Don't you see there's absolutely no doubting he's The Mastermind behind all of these murders are you even listening to me if

156
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
You don't hurry if you don't hurry and take action tell him we'll stop Johan the only way he can

157
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
Calm yourself doctor

158
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,183
My investigation is going exactly as planned I assure you

159
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
If that's all

160
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
Yo honey it's real he's right in front of us

161
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
Open your eyes loon game

162
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,215
Indeed spoken like a true criminal psychologist

163
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
He's right in front of us

164
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,847
I Harbor no doubt regarding johann's existence

165
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
Johan does exist

166
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,855
Within 10ma's head that is

167
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,975
So what's the latest have you gathered any new information

168
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,047
Nope this guy keeps singing the same old song

169
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,655
The gun in question turned out to be a Mauser sr-93

170
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
Says he sold it to a Japanese man

171
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
You want us to tighten the screws

172
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
No

173
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,335
That's probably the extent of what he knows

174
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Yeah

175
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:52,223
A Mauser sr-93 is a sniper rifle unless I'm mistaken

176
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Yeah

177
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
High Precision model

178
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
