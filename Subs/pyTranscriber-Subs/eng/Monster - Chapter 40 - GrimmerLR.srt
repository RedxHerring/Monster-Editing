1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:06,656
Just run you have to go the police are on

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,056
The Public Square by the station

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,640
There

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
Give me the message

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,016
Here it is

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
Bridge

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,184
And the three frogs my father said something else also

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,744
If the monster that you're chasing

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
Happens to have a twin

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
The mother of those same twins

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:42,496
Is still alive and Brock

12
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
So Mr Grimmer have any luck

13
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,392
Did you find some of the information you were looking for

14
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,208
What's your after won't be easy to locate

15
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,024
Record keeping changed when the East and West United

16
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
Data from before then it's hard to find

17
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,144
My thank you for this opportunity principal

18
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
Frankly I'm surprised you have even this much left

19
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Most

20
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
Far less

21
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
And of course you're quite correct

22
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
When the Berlin Wall fell

23
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:00,224
Almost all of the data involving East Germany's unsavory practices disappeared forever

24
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
You know

25
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:07,904
I feel quite sure that the children in the orphanages of the oldies Germany were victims of physical and mental abuse

26
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:13,536
But of course the real challenge here is actually finding any written records to prove my thoughts are true

27
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
You're thinking sounds right

28
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,216
You know most of East Germany's orphanages were being managed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health and Welfare

29
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
But a much bigger problem was created when the authorities classified a child's parents as criminal offenders political prisoners

30
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,688
There's spies or even illegal immigrants

31
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
In the midst of all of the orphanages that took care of these children there was one special orphanage run by the notorious internal

32
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
Affairs Ministry

33
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,256
Apparently there were many instances of abuse and these inhumane personality Corrections took place

34
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
At one particular orphanage

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
Anyhow that's what I want to find out

36
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
And as much detail as possible

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
I want to know every last little thing that happened there

38
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,264
I'm leaving no stone unturned

39
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
My that's a tedious task huh

40
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,152
I'd like to help but there's not much information to share

41
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,272
Most of those involved have passed away kept silent or their leading new lives

42
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
I'm sure you're right

43
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,440
Even Mr schner who's now an instructor here won't speak with me wait did you say Mr schner

44
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,047
Yes he was a teacher at East Germany's 62 kinderheim under the old regime

45
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,863
I requested interview I'm about his past but

46
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
You refused my request

47
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Listen

48
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,079
There's a real possibility Mr terrorized children while he worked in East Germany so I'd be a little more cautious around him

49
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
If I were you

50
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:40,575
Oh would it be all right if I photocopied some of the information in these books sure that would be just fine

51
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,975
Mr Grimmer if I may you are a newspaper journalist from West Germany isn't that correct

52
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
No I'm from this side

53
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,583
Well I work as a reporter for a newspaper in leip

54
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Well

55
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,703
I never expected a human rights Advocate like you to be from the Eastern BL

56
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
It's true

57
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,871
During that time I used to travel all over the world as a special overseas news correspond

58
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,295
Yeah I went everywhere on missions for the government

59
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Do you understand

60
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
I used to be a spy

61
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,279
Here we go

62
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
Goodness you're back looks awfully heavy

63
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,679
Well it's packed with all the data I've collected traveling around East Germany

64
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,495
I can't wait to read up on your findings

65
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,335
So where are you heading to Next oh to the Czech Republic

66
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
On to PR

67
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
Thank you for all your help principal

68
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,399
I heard you getting treated pretty badly by those boys

69
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
And they ended up taking your shoes away didn't they

70
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
You know crying won't help

71
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,951
Hey you know what it's been proven that people can live without shoes

72
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
After all every last one of us was born barefoot

73
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
But I must say

74
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,935
Anyone who bullies other people by stealing their shoes

75
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
They're the worst

76
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,055
Anyhow now you have shoes again so there's no need to cry anymore

77
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Take care

78
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:02,399
I'm guessing they're a little big for you am I right

79
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,759
Excuse me sir

80
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,599
Do you have a second sir of course what is it

81
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
I'm kind of in a fix

82
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
You see I have a big problem

83
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:30,047
My briefcase that had my passport and it was stolen just a while ago

84
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,119
Your passport was stolen not really is a big problem

85
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,263
I turned around and it was gone I'm on my way to see my younger sister who lives in Vienna

86
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,103
Only yesterday I got a phone call saying that she suddenly collapsed

87
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
She collapsed

88
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
You need to find a way to get there as soon as possible

89
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:52,063
Where are the police maybe they can help you I already talked to them

90
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,903
The bigger problem is my poor sister doesn't have any money for a doctor

91
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
Oh no that's got to be the worst news yet

92
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:02,303
And the top things off my stolen briefcase had my wallet in it too

93
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
No

94
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,983
I know I can't go but if I could at least find a way to water some money to my sister she could get some medical attention but now

95
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,383
Now it's looking like I can't even do that so just how much do you need oh no no no you don't need to help out

96
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
Honestly I don't need that much money really

97
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,551
All I need is to pull together a small amount of cash just enough so she can see a doctor

98
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,367
Here I'm just sorry I don't have more to give you

99
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,743
Oh thank you sir don't question I swear that I'll pay you back very soon

100
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,071
Just write down the address where you want me to send the check

101
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
That's all right no need to repay me

102
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,679
Just see that your sister gets the help she needs okay

103
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
God bless you sir

104
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,055
Thank you so much I wish you and your sister all the best

105
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,407
Come on Daddy how could you hand over your money to that Hustler

106
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,479
He was lying and story was just a scam

107
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
A scam

108
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
That guy works as train station all the time looking for suckers like you I can't believe you got fooled

109
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Play that Hustler

110
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
I really got fooled

111
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
Attention the express training frog will be departing

112
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,007
3:15 p.m.

113
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335
Damn it

114
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
I didn't think it was going to make it for a sec

115
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
Thanks for your help you're welcome

116
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,919
Hey thanks again for earlier do you mind if I sit here no go ahead

117
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
So where are you headed

118
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
Oh man I'm headed for Prague

119
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
I'm guessing you're Japanese am I right

120
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,319
Konichiwa oh dumb you know I visited Japan a couple of times

121
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
Oh how long has it been since I was there last well it's been a couple of years I can tell you

122
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:45,119
That much the last time I was over there was a business trip but I went to Akihabara to purchase some wiretap equipment

123
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
Another high-tech gadgets oh yeah that reminds me this song it was really popular I'm sure you know

124
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
Oh talk about dorino

125
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,319
No no that's not right you keep tunnel soccer

126
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
Oh that's right that's how it goes tunnel

127
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
My son would have loved it if I

128
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,519
Brought back a plastic model toy for him so where's your son now oh he's gone

129
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
My son died

130
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
Departure passport check if you would present your pass

131
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,647
Oh sure I love course

132
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
Danke Schoen

133
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,871
Look there's the Elder River how's the trout fishing

134
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,223
Been on the Elba River this year anyway it hasn't been very good sir

135
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
Huh is that so cuz last year I caught a trout this big on that river that wouldn't happen this

136
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
This year Duncan sir

137
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,823
He's on to the fact that was a fake passport you just showed him

138
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:40,319
You need to get moving right now Dr Tema how is it that you know who I am that's not

139
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,719
What does matter here is that the Border Police have realized your passports are fake and I'm sure they're on their way

140
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,791
So you need to get out of here right now doctor Tenma

141
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:12,575
Move it you come on we need to get past you sorry about this guys

142
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:18,975
My duffel bag so big and overstuffed I guess I'm kind of stuck here I can't seem to move get out of the way right now

143
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:25,375
Believe me sir I am trying to get out of the way what's in that bag anyway some very valuable

144
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:38,175
Good I finally got loose

145
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
Do you know where that other man went to me there was an Asian man who was sitting with you in this comp

146
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
Yeah you're right well maybe he got hungry and went to the dining car movement

147
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:57,375
Passenger car too we have an Asian man using a fake passport who's running loose on his

148
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,775
What's wrong

149
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,679
You did very well back there

150
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
They're not chasing us

151
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
They're searching the other way

152
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,615
Since the train was stopped I figured I should get off

153
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
Oh I guess I forgot to introduce myself doctor

154
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
My name is Grimmer

155
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:51,391
I thought you might need some guidance doctor 10 minutes so if you'd like I could show you the way to the Border

156
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
I'm very well acquainted with this area

157
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,847
Actually I fished around here quite a few times it's mountainous terrain so the hike ain't easy but the view

158
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Grimmer

159
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
Why did you help me anyway

160
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,367
Well you see I worked for a newspaper company in East Germany

161
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
But now I'm doing my own

162
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Freelance journalist

163
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:32,095
I've read every article about you I could find and I have to admit I find you very interesting

164
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,703
Being falsely accused of crimes was a part of everyday life in East Germany

165
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
Political prisoners charged without Merit

166
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
Accused murderers who weren't really guilty

167
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
Seeing that happen all the time

168
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:49,247
You got to have a pretty good eye for spotting who was guilty and who was innocent

169
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
And I'd say you're innocent

170
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
Does that sound about right doctor ten

171
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,487
Listen do me a favor and stop calling me doctor

172
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
Huh

173
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,887
But doctor Tenma you're one of the world's most brilliant neurosurgeons aren't you proud of that

174
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
I am no longer a doctor

175
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
So

176
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
What do you think

177
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
The Magnificent view isn't it

178
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,111
And from here we can see anyone coming up the mountain after us

179
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,743
That said I think we've earned a well-deserved break for lunch

180
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
Would you care to join me for a sandwich

181
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
I also brought a rather nice red wine

182
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,447
Oh and some delicious cheese

183
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
Thank you for your offer

184
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
But I really need to keep on moving

185
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
It's hours until sunset

186
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,431
It'll be easier and safer trying to cross the border after Dark

187
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
Eating outside like this

188
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
It's just the best

189
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,463
It's such a treat to do this once in awhile isn't it Dr tema

190
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,047
Enjoying delicious food while taking in a wonderful View

191
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,191
It's moments like this that help me truly feel the pleasures of living

192
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:20,383
I must admit I have a profound respect for you doctors journalists like myself served entertain people

193
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,479
Hopefully my readers feel happier to be alive after reading my articles

194
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
But what you do

195
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,599
That's powerful you literally give people life

196
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
But I

197
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
Shot a man

198
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
I did it on purpose

199
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
It happened last month in mun

200
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
It's the first time I shot someone

201
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
I think he probably died

202
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,295
My hands were trembling so much I couldn't name

203
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
I think I'd really be able to do it

204
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
But after I shot him

205
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
My hand stopped Tre

206
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,863
And now

207
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
I know that I have to shoot another man

208
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,495
I have to stop a man that's pure evil

209
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
One thing is for certain

210
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
I'm not doctor

211
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,351
When I see the Elbow River I think of how I'd give anything to change the past

212
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:49,215
Yeah I would have made a difference so I could have shared the joy of fishing here with my son

213
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,799
What was he like your little boy

214
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
You can catch a trout this big in that River

215
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,247
My poor son died without me ever sharing the pleasures of the outdoors with him

216
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,599
What makes me the saddest is feeling that his life could have been saved

217
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
If a doctor like you had been there for him

218
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,375
I swear you can catch trout this big I'm not kidding around here

219
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,663
The other side of that mountain is the check border

220
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,527
Follow the force path pass there and you'll hit a road where you might be able to get a ride

221
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,111
As for me I'm heading back to the train station now

222
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,207
Thank you Mr Grimmer I never would have made it this far without you helping me

223
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,535
I truly wish you the best of luck

224
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
Dr

225
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,471
Say if we meet again let's plan for another great picnic all right

226
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,711
Hey doctor Tenma

227
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,831
Everyone in this world carries around their own sins

228
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
And they never go away

229
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,695
But that doesn't change the fact that we do what we must

230
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,463
How wonderful

231
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,887
I'd always heard this was a beautiful city this may be my first night in Prague but I'm already Enchanted it's like a village

232
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:58,495
Message from a fairy tale

233
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,735
Excuse me do you mind if I sit here

234
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:15,391
Search yourself I must say I'm completely

235
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
Captivated by this city

236
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,072
You're Mr pedrov Right you bought your Russian citizenship and now here you are

237
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
Living in Prague

238
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:30,752
I'd like to ask you some things about your past sir would you be willing to help me with some answers Mr

239
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
Pedro

240
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,360
Oh my mistake your real name is reinhard-beerman isn't it

241
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,504
There was this very special orphanage located in East Berlin right

242
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,624
It was more of a laboratory really we're experiments were conducted on children's personalities

243
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,440
It was called 511 kinderh

244
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:55,840
And you were the director there Mr bierma

245
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,656
You should know all about the abuse that went on there

246
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,472
After all sir you were the one running the place

247
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,056
Just what were you trying to achieve in those experiments

248
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Back in East Berlin

249
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,504
511 kinderheim care to explain it to me
