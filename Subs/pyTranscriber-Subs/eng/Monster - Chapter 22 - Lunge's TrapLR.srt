1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,816
Excuse me sir just a couple of questions please

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:09,216
Stay there stay right there

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:15,616
Please tell us what the police are thinking what are your views on this situation

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:22,016
Mr and Mrs yopay were quite wealthy and have no children right no matter how you look at it it's obvious this

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,112
It is exactly like the other cases of murdered middle-aged couples across Germany

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,904
No comment at this time

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,000
I've heard that the bka is sending an agent to look into this is that true

8
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:37,120
Does that mean there's a connection to the serial murders oh man

9
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:43,776
I think I'd have better luck talking to a bka suit directly than trying to get this guy to give me anything

10
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,592
Just trust me all right

11
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,408
I promise you will be the first ones with the story

12
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,224
Just make sure you leave plenty of space on the front page

13
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,296
Just dude I got to go

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,624
Excuse me sir

15
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,416
My name is Kipper

16
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
I'm with the Hamburg tog

17
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:08,352
You've been sent here by the bka to investigate this murder correct me if I'm wrong

18
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
I was wondering

19
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:14,752
Is this case somehow connected to the others here real murders well Kipper of the Hamburg tog

20
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
You're right on both counts

21
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
Get your pen ready

22
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
Because here's my statement

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,760
A middle-aged couple was murdered and it appears to be another serial slaying

24
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
I knew it

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,088
And it's a suspect that Japanese doctor

26
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
Yes I just saw the report

27
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,952
It's his Mo the murders were carried out the same way

28
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
Thank you for the scoop

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
Got to run oh one more thing

30
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
I'm aware the Hamburg tog is the leading local newspaper

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,800
But I expect you to make sure your story gets published in every major newspaper in the country as well

32
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Hey consider it done

33
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Thanks again for all your help friend

34
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
I have become the Killer

35
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
I think to myself as I approach

36
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
What's the best way to

37
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648
Need to get into their house

38
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Should I knock

39
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,024
I don't want to startle the Yoke pays by walking in on them

40
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Such a friend

41
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
They greet me

42
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
And show me to the living room

43
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,384
These folks aren't the least bit suspicious as they Lead Me In

44
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:12,160
The husband's chair naturally I sit on the sofa facing him

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
A few minutes later the husband will die on the floor over there

46
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
But I haven't made that movie yet

47
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
So I have to decide when to eliminate him

48
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:30,079
I'll do it when the wife leaves a room where did she go

49
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
To the kitchen to make us some tea she is stabbed in the back before she even has a chance to serve it

50
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
Obviously that I need to make my move on the husband while she's occupied in the kitchen

51
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,279
I reach in pull out the knife the husband sees this Panic tries to stand up by stab him

52
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,679
But I miss and end up slashing him the husband runs off with blood dripping from his wounded left hand

53
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,079
So I try to get him again I swing the night this time I only puncture his right shoulder I'm such a clumsy

54
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,479
Amateur desperately the husband yells his wife's name only she can't hear him from out in the kitchen

55
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
Recently she's developed a hearing problem yes turns out I knew about that didn't I

56
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
Shout all you want I can take my time to kill you and then your wife you're trapped

57
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,679
There's your left hand print on the wall you can't get away from me I've got you pinned against this table

58
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,751
You're finished

59
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,847
But then something prevents me from completing the task

60
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,943
5 m from this point where the husband dies

61
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
How come why not just eliminate them here and be done with it

62
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
My weight

63
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,399
Do you suspect he's the one who broke in and murdered my neighbors

64
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
For the moment I can only say he's a person of interest but I'm asking everybody in the neighborhood for their cooperation in this

65
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,407
If you see this man just act normal I don't want him to become suspicious

66
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
Then get in touch with me as soon as you possibly can

67
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
That would be all I need for you to do

68
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
I personally assure you you won't be in any danger

69
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,767
Hard to imagine such a tragic event like this happening here it's such a pleasant

70
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
Quiet neighborhood

71
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
It really is

72
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
Any old pays for such nice people just the best

73
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,775
When I call out to her from my doorstep Mrs yopay would always greet me cheerfully

74
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
That's very interesting

75
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,943
I've been told Mrs yopay lost her hearing about a year ago and refused to hearing aid

76
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,991
Huh are you sure

77
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
It was in her medical record

78
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
If I had to guess

79
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,391
She really couldn't hear any of your greetings

80
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,559
Well knowing the type of person she was she probably sensed my presence and wanted to make me feel good

81
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,423
So then in your opinion nobody else in the neighborhood knew about her hearing loss either

82
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,495
No I wouldn't think so

83
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,079
It certainly appears that your business is booming

84
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
You made rapid progress at an early age

85
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,223
It's not easy for a young man to achieve such quick success Mr

86
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
You're right

87
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,087
The contracts I made with the car manufacturers just happened to work out

88
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:28,255
Before we begin I'd like to extend my deepest condolences for the recent loss of your aunt and uncle

89
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Thank you

90
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,375
They're passing was a great loss they were the only relatives I had left in the world

91
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
It appears they never had any children of Their Own

92
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,031
So they must have taken good care of you since you were there only nephew

93
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Yes

94
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
They treated me as if I were their son

95
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,919
Sir tell me you'll be able to catch the murderer

96
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
I will

97
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,807
I'm pretty sure I know who's behind it me too I bet it was that Japanese doctor wasn't it

98
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Sounds like you're very well informed

99
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
Well of course I am

100
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,207
As a matter of fact I've heard he's been linked to other murders similar to this

101
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
I'm curious

102
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
Just how much do you stand to inherit

103
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,935
You see I found out that Mr yope was quite a wealthy man

104
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
So what

105
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
His wealth has nothing to do with the serial murder case

106
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,383
Sir I presume you are the sole heir to their considerable estate

107
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,199
Seeing as how you are they're only nephew

108
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,807
It's inappropriate to be discussing my inheritance in these circumstances

109
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,975
A company can appear to be booming on the surface but underneath may have serious cash flow problems that have gotten out of

110
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,535
It's a common occurrence in the business world

111
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:39,423
Just a minute you're implying I murdered them when there's a serial killer on the loose how dare you

112
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,031
What are you so worried about you have a perfect Alibi for the time in question

113
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,687
And you have plenty of witnesses you bought your secretary and some others a nice dinner after a long meeting

114
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
What exactly are you getting at

115
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
That it appears that you could not be the murderer

116
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
I'm sure you agree

117
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,999
Inspectorlingay well

118
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,815
What do you want Kipper what the hell is going on

119
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
Going on with what

120
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
Don't play dumb inspector

121
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,727
I've been out digging up stuff on that nephew for the last couple days

122
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,591
His company looks profitable at first glance but turns out to be holding a lot of bad stocks and bonds

123
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Cash Wise it's in the world of hurt

124
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
And now

125
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
I found out you've been investigating the same company

126
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,807
I want the truth who killed those folks Looney

127
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
In light of what you've uncovered

128
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,695
Do you still think this case is related to the other middle-aged murders

129
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
All of the newspapers have printed A variation of my story

130
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,143
If the cases aren't related then it's just Sensational journalism my reputation could be damaged

131
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Your instincts are correct

132
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,079
It's the work of a copycat it was set up to look like the serial killer

133
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
That's just great

134
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:58,015
I've got to publish retraction right away no it's fine as it is you'll continue

135
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:04,415
Follow-up stories as if this case were another one of the middle-aged couple murders what it's not ethical no way

136
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:10,815
I won't do it I tell you oh but you will I'm I'm an honest journalist who believes in reporting the whole truth and

137
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:17,215
You're not going to tell me what I can write well let me give you the truth Goode right love

138
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,615
You have a pleasant home with a devoted wife and a doting daughter who both

139
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:30,015
Adore you but it was impossible for you to resist the charms of that attractive Other Woman wasn't it

140
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
Continuous before

141
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,951
No beef it up a little

142
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
Write a special report about the serial murders if you do as I've asked

143
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:50,751
He'll most certainly come I'm counting on you

144
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
Yes who is it

145
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,575
Excuse me ma'am may I ask you some questions

146
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Well

147
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,999
Sounds like the your pace we're really a wonderful couple

148
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
They were

149
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
I see

150
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
And you're absolutely certain they didn't have any adopted children

151
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Oh yes

152
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,519
Did any children children that you never seen before live with them even for a short time

153
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
No never

154
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,639
But they took very good care of their nephew he was the apple of their eye

155
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,503
Would you like more tea it won't take a minute I'm fine

156
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
A little more tea won't hurt you

157
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
There's no mistaking

158
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Right now

159
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Nothing to worry about

160
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
Thanks for your cooperation

161
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,079
Inspect a long day someone's here to see you

162
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Well who is it

163
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,919
He says he's the nephew of the lope

164
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
That couple that was killed

165
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,575
Inspector you believe I'm the one who murdered them I'm your suspect right

166
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
You think I killed my aunt and uncle for their money

167
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
That's what you hinted at the other day

168
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Let's

169
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
We both know that I have many debts right now

170
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,911
And the inheritance money they ended up leaving me will more than likely get me out of this whole mess

171
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,239
However that's not the kind of person I am

172
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,079
Is that really all you came here to tell me

173
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
All I came

174
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,711
Wait a minute how dare you speak to me in such a condescending way

175
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,831
Well if you'll excuse me there's somewhere I have to be right at the moment

176
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,695
Don't you walk away I demand an apology for your disrespectful Behavior

177
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,023
Perhaps you weren't aware that the police had been following you

178
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
Well now that order has been canceled

179
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
Your local law enforcement thinks that you're innocent

180
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,335
Isn't that good enough for you Mr geebel

181
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
You want to know if I think you are guilty

182
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,711
That really doesn't matter to me at the moment

183
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,343
My chief concern is to catch the man I've been after

184
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,119
The blood stain over there can only mean one thing

185
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
He must have missed then am I to assume that you're convinced the Japanese doctor is responsible

186
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:39,455
Never assume anything I've concluded it was a copycat murder

187
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,319
Look like the middle-aged couples homicides but how can you be so certain about that

188
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:49,439
Because there's one element this case has it makes a different from all the others

189
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,839
The killer Corner the victim here but he doesn't

190
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
Finish him off he waits till his victim gets over there before delivering the final blow

191
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Why why does the murderer hesitate

192
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
It's not him

193
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
That element

194
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
Is emotion

195
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Emotion

196
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,695
Yes you see the man I'm after always take small valuables

197
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,255
He tries to make his crimes look like robberies

198
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,327
He murders quickly without hesitation or emotion

199
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
At least that's his go

200
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,703
But this crime scene is full of emotions

201
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,335
The killer panicked when he saw his face and the victim's face together in the mirror

202
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
You needn't worry

203
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,223
From what I've observed the police in this town are totally incompetent

204
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,159
This crime was definitely not committed by Johann

205
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,743
But somebody wants the police to pin it on him

206
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,815
How much longer is this all going to continue

207
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
When will it end

208
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,687
Hello it's been a while

209
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,015
So we finally meet again

210
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
Dr tinma

211
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
I've been looking all over for you

212
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
For a very long time

213
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
I've been hoping to have a quiet

214
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Chat with you

215
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
There's no use in

216
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:45,151
Away anymore stop trying to escape and talk to me period the fact is

217
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,551
There's no place you can hide Dr tena

218
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,951
Yes you're all mine

219
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
Why couldn't you just leave it alone

220
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
Your confession means nothing to me just stay out of my way

221
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
He's been seriously wounded

222
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,791
I've got to do something now or he's going to bleed to death

223
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
Who could have

224
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
I'll drop him off in front of the hospital and get away

225
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Where are

226
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,583
I need the keys to the handcuffs tell me where you put them inspector

227
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
Don't bother reaching for your gun

228
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,447
I took it off you while you were unconscious

229
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,311
Don't be so stubborn just give me the keys I'm a doctor but I can't help you like this

230
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,871
How you examined your wound the best I could

231
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,431
It appears that only your muscles sustain the damage

232
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,295
But you're losing an awful lot of blood if we don't stop the bleeding you're going to die

233
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
Come on confess

234
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Do it

235
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
Best to what

236
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:15,679
That you murdered the director of Isler Memorial Hospital along with three others

237
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,031
And that you've been on a 3-year Killing Spree targeting middle-aged couples

238
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
It's time to

239
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Come clean

240
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Admit

241
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
Done

242
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,431
If you keep this up you'll be a Deadman

243
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Come

244
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Don't try to

245
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,599
You're only fooling yourself by running around chasing this elusive Johan

246
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
Yohan doesn't exist

247
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
Admit it you made him up

248
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Your Yohan

249
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Entertain

250
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
Own up to it

251
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,215
Inspector right now you require emergency treatment I have everything I need to do the procedure

252
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:54,591
Except for my hands and I can't save your life when I'm chained together yes

253
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
When you're the

254
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,223
Dr Tema those are the hands of a highly skilled surgeon

255
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
I will save many lives

256
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,343
But how many people have you killed with those hands

257
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
You've got it wrong I'm not a killer

258
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
No but you change into Johan

259
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,791
It's a good

260
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Turn into the

261
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
Monster

262
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,423
I already told you he mistaken

263
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
They tell you

264
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
I never make

265
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
Mistakes

266
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,847
Your blood pressure is falling you're going to lose Consciousness soon

267
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Your CR

No more talking it'll weaken you

270
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,271
Your crime scenes are always lacking in something

271
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
An emotional

272
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Factor

273
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
Save your strength

274
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Dealing with

275
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
Day forces

276
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Emot

277
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
Right

278
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
You develop a cold EXT

279
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
Yes I always find it's your crime

280
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
Calm emot

281
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
Taking of life

282
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
I am not that kind of man

283
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,919
Every time I operate a thousand emotions go through my head

284
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
Hey affect my every decision

285
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Is my diagnosis accurate

286
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
Will there be any unforeseen complications

287
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
Well my patient even survive

288
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,719
How can I become when I hold a person's life in my hand

289
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
His hand

290
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
How in the hell can I become

291
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Closer

292
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,287
Stop I can save you

293
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
I will

294
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,223
Shoot I need my hands to stop the bleeding are the keys in your pants pocket tell me

295
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,015
I will

296
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,239
You really had us worried for a while

297
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,287
But you're looking quite well

298
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,359
Lots better than when you're running around investigating crimes

299
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
I guess this means you're not rid of me yet

300
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
Yeah you'll be back on your feet in no time

301
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,087
That emergency procedure you received before you got here was done perfectly

302
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
Your doctor said you wouldn't be alive without it

303
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
I'm assuming that

304
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,000
And used them to save my life

305
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,304
Yeah well he got away but we got G

306
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
He confessed a murdering the you'll pick

307
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
He stabbed you because you were on to him

308
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
You did good lung

309
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Thank you

310
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Well

311
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
What do you think

312
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
About what

313
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,152
It's quite clear that Tim must save lunga's life

314
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,736
So I'm worried looking might have a problem pursuing him now

315
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
I'm wondering if I should remove

316
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
The

317
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:50,208
I'm sorry did he call for you again inspector loon get can be very demanding

318
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,512
Oh he really isn't that difficult at all

319
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
In fact I find him to be very pleasant

320
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,168
I keep telling him not to rush through the recovery process but he's quite determined

321
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,264
He's already working on strengthening his grip and he's taking long walks down the hall

322
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,336
He seems to be having a really fun time recovering

323
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
He's having fun

324
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
Yes he's always telling me that nothing has been more enjoyable for him than what was the suspect's

325
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:20,928
Name again oh yes it was 10 ma that chasing after a criminal like is the most

326
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
Funny could ever have
