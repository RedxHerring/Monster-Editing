1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
He was released

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:03,840
Yes

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:06,144
Johan Liebert was discharged this morning

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,680
Wow that was fast

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,592
They said he just collapsed all of a sudden but I guess it could have been anything too serious

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,664
Oh you

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,224
You come by the library a fair amount

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,296
Hey you're a librarian at the University aren't you

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,392
So they let him out already

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,464
That's a relief he gave me such a scare yesterday

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,792
So you were there when you collapsed then

12
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
He was trying to track down a book

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,680
And I was the one helping him just the luck of the draw

14
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,472
And then it happened

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
I've never heard a person scream like that before

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
What's that I'm off

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,200
He had this picture book and he flipped it to a certain page

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
Picture

19
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,896
Nobody think less of you for taking a few days off you know

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
Your EEG readings were normal they didn't show anything

21
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
In fact you're the picture of Health

22
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,880
You know the doctor says it's probably anemia or fatigue

23
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,464
Another possibility is that you experience some sort of shock

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
Or so the doctor says

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,144
By the way he also mentioned something about a scar on your head from a major surgery

26
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,544
I'm just giving you a hard time but seriously you should probably take it easy for a bit

27
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
Oh I almost forgot

28
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,688
You got some mail this letter came for you while you were in the hospital

29
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
Oh really

30
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,808
It's strange they didn't put their return address

31
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,928
But I didn't hear any ticking so I think you're okay

32
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,192
What's so funny you hun come on share the joke

33
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
Just what did they send you anyway

34
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
Oh it's merely a letter from the red Hindenburg

35
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Huh

36
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
You look pretty wholesome you show your tall enough for this ride what are you lost kid or maybe you're looking

37
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Is it yeah if you want to learn your ABCs I'm the perfect girl for the job come on you don't happen to know

38
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
So the red Hindenburg do you the red Hindenburg I'm looking for her she's nearby

39
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,576
Fine they're in the back

40
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,863
Name me fix I'm coming down too hard

41
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
Will I find a red

42
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
Hindenburg at the top of the stairs

43
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
It's open

44
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
Oh good you came

45
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
Make yourself at home

46
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
Yes that face

47
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
You such a beautiful face

48
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,407
I saw you on TV kid the evening news right next to shoe volt smooth one aren't you

49
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
So now you're calling yourself the red Hindenburg

50
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,647
After calling yourself Margo Langer all that time and before the name was

51
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
Sophie call me whatever as long as I get paid

52
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,535
Names don't mean crap right Johan Liebert

53
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,935
If you simply must know it's a pet name for my latest boyfriend

54
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
He's waiting back there behind door number one

55
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
Thank you honey

56
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
Don't go getting any funny ideas sweetie

57
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
He's holding a big gun in his hand and he's just itching to give it a go you should see the one he's got in his pants

58
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
I'm impressed

59
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:32,703
Mormon your way and old shoe volt confidence like that you're running one hell of a scheme

60
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,847
I'm not just saying it to be polite

61
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
I remember you bringing that far invoice saying he was shoe called son who could have ever guessed the real deal would come

62
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,647
Forward those are some pretty long odds right yes you knew better or little

63
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Redman Farr and

64
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:57,023
Fool you practically tied the news for him as soon as he'd served his

65
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
Well good it took me 2 years

66
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:06,239
That's how long ago the real Margo Langer died and let me tell you the timing couldn't have been better

67
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,615
After she died her name allowed me to cash in on chevald's guilt

68
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
No point letting that money go to

69
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,415
Whatever it's not like the girl was my closest friend or anything

70
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
She wasn't even turning tricks anymore she said she went completely clean we just had a couple of drinks nothing

71
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Nothing more

72
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679
She probably didn't have anyone else to talk to

73
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,751
Let's get her drug shed a few crocodile tears

74
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
And suddenly your life was an open book

75
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
I heard all about her fling with shoe V

76
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431
And about sending his bastard to an orphanage

77
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:53,087
And then the poor thing went got herself killed I used the name Margo Langer to get shoe balls money and I lived

78
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
Happily ever after end of story

79
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,303
When Margo was killed the police concluded she was the victim of a random attack Case Closed little did they know

80
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,423
Dead former hooker was just one measly piece and a big gory puzzle

81
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Like Richard Brown

82
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,127
The former police detective I can't help but feel sorry for the guy

83
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,735
If he hadn't gotten so nosy maybe you wouldn't have felt like jumping that faithful night

84
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,207
Goodness me what's the body count again

85
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,351
Enough reminiscing let's get down to why I asked you to come here tonight

86
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Business my dear

87
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,215
And don't even think about squirming your way out of this one

88
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
Ain't that right honey

89
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
So name a number I'm listening

90
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
What are you de

91
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
I think it's the ultimate fear I really thought I'd already

92
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
What the hell are you mumbling about now but then

93
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:22,431
I be held a Darkness even great

94
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Wait a minute

95
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
You think you can just walk away

96
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
I'm leaving this town you see shoe vald no longer amuses me

97
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:45,727
Try to blow me off kid it's no use how do you shoot a person who doesn't

98
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
I'm through messing around

99
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Honey

100
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
Honey get out here already

101
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935

What my kids going in first just wait your turn

106
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
Hurt so

00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519

108
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
You said it fellow why no you want there's still only one doctor here am I right

109
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,623
Hey young man what have you got in that bundle of yours huh

110
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,183
Ah this it's nothing

111
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,023
You don't happen to know if this particular doctor is good do you sir

112
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Best of the bunch

113
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,911
If it weren't for this doctor all us Asians around here we'd all be dead

114
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Especially the Vietnamese

115
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Really you don't say

116
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,311
Hold on you're not Vietnamese right

117
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
No I'm not

118
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
Wait a sec where are you going

119
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,223
Some of these folks are in a bad way son let them go first

120
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,295
Don't worry I didn't come here as a patient for what it's worth

121
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:13,695
Hey hold up you need to wait your turn he needs to be looked at right now doctor my kid is first

122
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
First you got that if you'd excuse me hey what the hell where do you think you're going pal I'm sorry doctor

123
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,703
I just wanted to ask you something really fast how many times do I have to tell you

124
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
I don't have time for this

125
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
A woman

126
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
And she's

127
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Didn't you hear me

128
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Get out of here

129
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
How old could she be

130
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
I'm in the middle of suturing this wound

131
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
If anything goes wrong it's on your head for

132
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Attracting me

133
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Establant in the thigh

134
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
It's from a knife

135
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
Her stitches are

136
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,239
I think the patient's going to need a drainage tube

137
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
I think you need to keep quiet

138
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
Otherwise you'd better take this person to a real Hospital they'll take care of it

139
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,247
No it's really not

140
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
It's no hospital

141
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
Any more than your real doctor

142
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
If a real Hospital were an option for these

143
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Don't you think they would have gone

144
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,535
Most of the patients who come here are undocumented IMM

145
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,375
If they took their problems to one of those real hospitals they be sent to jail

146
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
And deported

147
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:35,615
How many people do you think I've had die right here in this room because a real Hospital wasn't a choice

148
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
See if your judgment for things you actually know something about

149
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
Insert the drainage tube now

150
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,623
The knife he was stabbed with probably wasn't very clean

151
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:54,815
Unless you insert a drainage tube the wound will get infected and form an abscess look I know what I'm talking about here

152
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
Okay now remove a few of the stitches

153
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:04,031
Insert that tube about 5 cm gently now

154
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
That's it you did a good job thank you very much who's the next patient

155
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
You're finally awake

156
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
You push yourself too hard

157
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,655
Your patience told me you'd been treating them for two days straight without any sort of break

158
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,007
I checked on everyone's post-operative status while you were asleep

159
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,079
You know you're pretty good at this for being Underground

160
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
How old are you anyway

161
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
17

162
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,015
I never would have guessed it based on your work

163
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,575
If the skills of a practicing physician

164
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
It just happened

165
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,999
The doctor who used to practice out of this building disappeared and left all his equipment behind

166
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,583
My equipment won't get you far without proper training

167
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,399
So where'd you learn your techniques anyway

168
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
My father

169
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
He was a doctor

170
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Is that so

171
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,895
He had a practice in Vietnam and when he came to East Germany to study he took me along with him

172
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
He ended up staying there for keep

173
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
Even opened up his own little clinic

174
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,295
And then the Berlin Wall came down

175
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:57,183
He never had enough time to treat everybody but he tried to help out the Immigrant Community as best he could

176
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Until

177
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
The damn man murdered my father

178
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Some neo-Nazi

179
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,007
Just because her skin is a different color

180
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
My father's dead

181
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,967
I was just a kid So eventually they sent me to an orphanage

182
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
A German family adopted me soon after

183
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,719
Turns out the only reason they took me in was to look like Good Samaritans to the neighborhood

184
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,303
We save this poor little yellow girl aren't we great

185
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
So I ran away

186
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,727
Anyway I've been helping my father at his Clinic from the start

187
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
I read a lot of the medical books in his library after he was killed

188
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,431
Someone had to carry on his mission and who better to do it than his own daughter

189
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,503
Step aside I can finish up the boys arm

190
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,111
That wasn't so bad go easy on it for a while if you wanted to heal right

191
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Okay

192
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Fine then who's up next

193
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,511
Most of them are treated and gone

194
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,143
You know you could be a top-notch doctor if you went to school

195
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,471
This country is full of opportunities for people who want to learn

196
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,823
Words of wisdom from a real doctor unless I'm wrong

197
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,895
I'm not going to close this Clinic because you say so

198
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
Hold on that's not what I'm saying here

199
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:28,063
I just thought that maybe you could if I leave who's going to take care of all those people who come here for help

200
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
No one nobody else here gives a damn listen what I meant was

201
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,023
What happened

202
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,375
My pissed him off he said I had a smart mouth

203
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
So he shot me

204
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,311
Mommy mommy your mom walked all the way here after being shot

205
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,895
We

206
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
But she's shot I will now go wait out there like

207
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,087
It's a good Brave boy okay

208
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,327
Around here it's the prostitutes who always get shot or knifed or worse

209
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
I wish there was something I could do but

210
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
I'm out of my league here

211
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
We need to get her on the table

212
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Lift up her legs

213
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
No way what do you think you're doing this woman needs to go to a real life

214
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:32,319
Tea Room

215
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,719
There's always a chance as long as the patient is still breathing do you understand

216
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
Don't ever give up hope

217
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:52,031
If the artery in her abdominal cavity had been damaged her blood pressure would have plummeted leading to

218
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
But she was able to walk here on her own which means her blood pressure dropped gradually she's in

219
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,831
State of pre-shock which improves our odds judging from the location of the bullet wound there could be some

220
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
Damage to the spleen we can perform emergency abdominal surgery on her while transfusing blood simultaneously

221
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,631
All right let's get started pick up the scout

222
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
It's amazing he can sleep so soundly

223
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:47,071
I still can't believe there was no damage to the stomach intestines or any part of the digestive tract

224
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,655
All we had to do was remove the injured portion of the spleen and Stitcher up

225
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,983
You did a great job in there

226
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,311
Only because you were there with me

227
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
Mommy

228
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,551
You know Dr Tim

229
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,391
This place could use you

230
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:22,399
I came here because I had a question to ask and I spotted this article

231
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,751
Blue Sophie also known as the red Hindenburg

232
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,103
Word on the street is you were the first person to arrive at the crime scene

233
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Are the rumors true

234
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,551
Can you tell me anything about what you saw when you got there anything at all

235
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,743
I got a call that somebody heard a shot so I rushed over as fast as I could

236
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,071
I got her in the back of the head Point Blank

237
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
She died instantly

238
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,191
I've seen many crime scenes but

239
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,495
This was different

240
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,615
The feeling that I got when I walked into that room

241
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
It wasn't a robbery

242
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
There wasn't any malice either

243
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:16,159
Simply a killing

244
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Go on

245
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,424
When you're in the darkness you only sink deeper into it

246
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
Keep the lights shining

247
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,848
Enroll in a program somewhere and study hard okay

248
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,896
You've got a real gift for this

249
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
You'll make a fine doctor

250
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:54,560
Please wait the darkness

251
00:21:54,816 --> 00:22:00,960
But you also look like someone sinking deeper into the darkness aren't you Doctor tema

252
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:06,848
Please tell me that you'll come back someday can you promise me that
