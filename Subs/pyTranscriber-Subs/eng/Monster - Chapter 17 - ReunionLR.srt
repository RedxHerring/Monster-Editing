1
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:15,872
She has a baby back

2
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:22,272
They're in the new Nazis are planning to burn the town

3
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
Dead up on the third floor

4
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
We're approaching the meeting place where Johan will be expecting you I'm not sure what will happen there

5
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
You do know how to use that gun right now

6
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:46,080
My plans have changed why the sudden change of heart what about killing Johan I'll deal with him later now

7
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
As I say General wolf will be disappointed to hear this news he personally requested that you kill Johan he

8
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
I don't take requests from anyone I'm going to kill

9
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,720
All ignition points are ready to go sir

10
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,768
Awaiting your orders to proceed

11
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
Well done

12
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,888
Time to celebrate our superiority with a little Firepower

13
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Now

14
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
What are we going to do with them

15
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,592
These two are an insult to our race

16
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,920
Unfortunately these types do exist Among Us

17
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
What is a

18
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,504
And the brat was trying to save the Turks

19
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
They're both filthy scum purify them it's time to teach him a lesson

20
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,024
This place is going to burn anyway leave them for the flames

21
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,656
Oh come on little one don't cry

22
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
Your mom is coming back

23
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Real soon

24
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
I can't believe you're still alive

25
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
How do you find me

26
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,368
It's all thanks to Dieter he told me that you lived in this building

27
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
So

28
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Where is Teeter

29
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Didn't he come by

30
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
Then where do you go

31
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
Hey have you seen Aisha

32
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
He needs her he misses his mom a lot

33
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
It can't

34
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
It's not possible I don't believe it

35
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
What about this poor little child he's too young to be without a mother what am I going to do what do I do

36
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,232
She's the last

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
There mustn't be any more victims

38
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,631
I need to see the leaders of the Turkish quarter now

39
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
So what does everyone think

40
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
Set the town on fire huh

41
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Not

42
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,527
We are rumors about the right wing extremists all the time

43
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
We can't overreact every time they threaten us

44
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,975
What's even more suspicious to me is this Japanese guy Waltzing in here though he says his life is in

45
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,815
What's the matter with all of you I say it's dead don't you get it

46
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
She was killed because she tried to warn all of us about this Danger

47
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
I wonder about that

48
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
She was a prostitute like you right

49
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,823
You women go off with Germans all the time and end up missing

50
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
There's nothing new

51
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
You may call us Turks look bad

52
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,247
How do we really know whose kid that is anyway

53
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,391
You all know how hard it is to make a living you should know better than to act like this

54
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
If you want to live

55
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
You've got to listen to me

56
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,607
Forget it do what you want you can burn and go to hell for all I care

57
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,423
No wait just one second

58
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
Are you suggesting Patrol groups

59
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,895
Maybe we should do is this Japanese man says we have nothing to lose Mr Denny's

60
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
Are you really going to listen to some Asian we don't know

61
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,855
He might be suspicious but there are certainly plenty of trustworthy Japanese

62
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
People in the world

63
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
I don't know

64
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
Word

65
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
General

66
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Who's

67
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
You mean you don't know about him

68
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:00,959
General knowgee was a brave Japanese man who saved the Turkish navy when they were lost in the Pacific years

69
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Years ago

70
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591
Go ahead and gather all our men IMM

71
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,967
It looks so delicious

72
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
Let's dig in shall we

73
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
No need to be in such a hurry ladies

74
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
Take your

75
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
We wouldn't want to finish eating before the

76
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Entertain

77
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,327
I planned it so by the time the main course comes around the show will be reaching its climax

78
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:32,703
In the meantime let's enjoy the 76 Chateau Le Tour I saved especially for this night

79
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,615
The first dish we will indulge in is my favorite

80
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
Raw Flounder with caviar

81
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,783
And does the feast begin

82
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
Voila the first fire

83
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
What a wonderful

84
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,511
But like I told you that's still just an appetizer

85
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
Where is the main course

86
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,631
Remember what I said don't be impatient

87
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,239
If you Savor your dinner my show will be something you'll truly enjoy

88
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:11,871
Tell me where the main course is if that's an appetizer

89
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:19,295
Then what are you going to burn for the main course

90
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,695
Cuz I thought

91
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:32,095
The plane started up wind this whole place could go up three groups save the women and children oh my goodness

92
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
What a lovely surprise and do what do we owe this honor

93
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
Don't even try it

94
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,311
Or kiss your boss goodbye dangerous thing away

95
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,127
Why don't we enjoy this meal together

96
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,479
Unfortunately it seems your appetizer is fizzling out

97
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,575
Don't worry that was just the beginning

98
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
This is your favorite right

99
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Sorry about that

100
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
Don't be so contrary my dear

101
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,935
You see after all this is a great celebration in honor of Johan

102
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
Listen to me Johan doesn't want any of this

103
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
And tell me how can you be so certain

104
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
I saw it with my own eyes

105
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,711
I followed his messages I know what he wants

106
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,783
Johan doesn't care about your plans

107
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
What exactly did you see

108
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,815
He doesn't want any of this don't you understand

109
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Relax

110
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,679
Calm down just take it easy because of you

111
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
I won't let anybody else die tonight

112
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:48,639
So where's the main course what part of town are you going to sit on fire

113
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:55,039
Take

114
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:01,439
Have you had any luck finding Dieter someone

115
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
Told me they saw a kid who looked like him near the park around noon

116
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:26,015
No

117
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,415
Let's just continue with my dinner is planned that girl sure is something I suppose

118
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,815
Just running the family the look she had in her eyes she

119
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
Kill me it's a good thing she didn't realize how close I was to giving her the actual

120
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:51,615
Location of the main course well shall we bring out the next dish sir no eat me some under

121
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
First

122
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:02,367
A scary girl isn't she

123
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:33,343
You're going to be just fine

124
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
Everything's okay all right now

125
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
Up here anyway

126
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
You want to know what happened lady

127
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
This bread almost got me killed

128
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
Forget this

129
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
I'm getting the hell out of here

130
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,615
If that was the smallest fire those skinheads said I wouldn't be a bit surprised

131
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,247
I grew up in this neighborhood I know the place like the back of my hand

132
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,343
If I wanted to burn down the town this wouldn't be the spot believe you me

133
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
This town ain't out of the woods just yet

134
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,887
There were three other fires up wind that were all so put out

135
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
We can't thank you enough for your help

136
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
Right everyone

137
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
Our next step is to take care of the injured

138
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,455
No I won't have any more victims not one more

139
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Wait

140
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
What are you talking about

141
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
Well the wind's going to change direction

142
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
It always happens every night around this time the wind just stops and it starts blowing towards town from where the

143
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
The wind

144
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,799
And now

145
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,639
Time for the main course to be served

146
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Did you see them running away

147
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
I love me

148
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
That should take care of it

149
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
Thanks for patching me up doctor

150
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Let me buy you a drink

151
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,279
What are you talking about you have to take it easy for a while

152
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,351
Oh come on loosen up Dr right

153
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:25,215
That's right it's thanks to you we were able to put out those fires and save the neighborhood

154
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,823
I bet those Neo Nazis are scratching their heads right now wondering what the hell happened

155
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
No doubt they are that'll teach him never underestimate that Turks what are they tendon

156
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,039
All the other injured people

157
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,439
Hey Dr 10ma take a break and relax come on why don't you have a drink with us

158
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
Not until everyone's taken care of

159
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
If all of the fires up until now we're just diversions

160
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,239
Where do you think they're going to light the real fire how the hell would I know who cares about this stupid town anyway

161
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
Besides there's something much more important on my mind that I got to take care of wait I need you to tell me and

162
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
I need you to tell me now

163
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,759
Where would you start the real fire get your hands off of me

164
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,343
Like I already told you the wind's going to come from the river

165
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,439
The abandoned Factory down there would be a perfect place for a fire

166
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,535
If I'm not mistaken there should still be a bunch of chemicals in the warehouse

167
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,679
Long

168
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,335
Something I can sink my teeth into yes this is going to be Del

169
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:43,295
We're right on schedule the celebration of the master

170
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,695
Price is about to begin

171
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
It's

172
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
Why did you follow me because I have to put out the fire I made a promise to Tenma

173
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
This is it

174
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,255
It's the warehouse

175
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:30,911
Thank goodness looks like they haven't found this place yet these are all filled with chemicals

176
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
If all of this were to go up it'd be hopeless there'd be nothing left of the town I'll protect

177
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,687
This place no matter what I'm not going to let those horrible people burn it down

178
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
Okay I slipped

179
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
What the heck is this

180
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:58,047
Smells like gas

181
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,631
What's there

182
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
It's all right I'm fine

183
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Hey you can walk on my own

184
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
Let's get you to a shelter so I can have a closer look at it

185
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Hey twisted my an

186
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,919
It probably happened when I was trying to get away from the fire

187
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,087
Now that I finally got this rug who gives a damn about this stinking town

188
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:26,463
I bet I can probably get $800,000 marks for this baby no a million

189
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,239
What happened to Dieter couldn't say he's probably where is he where did he go what happened to him

190
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,335
Last I saw he was going to the abandoned warehouse by the river

191
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
Why there

192
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,431
The wind's going to blow in from the river soon

193
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,783
So if the chemicals in that warehouse are set on fire it's all over for this town

194
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:59,487
This is what I was talking about tell

195
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
You evacuate from the Riverside shelters right away you're going to take me there

196
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Who is

197
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Who's back there

198
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
Please don't move

199
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
Can it be true

200
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,655
Are you really Johan's sister

201
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
Once I sent this trail of gasoline on fire

202
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
This Warehouse is going to go up

203
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
An inst

204
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,615
I'm going to shoot you in the head before that happens

205
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:54,271
I can fire quicker than you can flick that lighter and I'm not afraid to do it and what if you miss I haven't skipped a day of

206
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
Training in 6 months straight

207
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
So I know

208
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
I can hit you from here

209
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
You don't

210
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,255
Don't you know this is a celebration of the master race

211
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
This is our big welcome for Johan

212
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
But Johan doesn't want any of the things you want

213
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,983
Yes it's true that he was recently seen here in Frankfurt

214
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,591
The only reason he came was to kill one of your leaders and all of his subordin

215
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
He left a message behind you know

216
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
What

217
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,527
Listen to me Johan is not the person you think he is

218
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
The truth

219
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
Is much more complex than that what are you trying to say

220
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
It's

221
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,975
It must be terrifying for him

222
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
He's suff

223
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,607
He's an anguish and teetering on the edge of despair

224
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:47,007
You know I'm not so sure it's such a good idea to be making enemies of these guys

225
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,591
Which way to the warehouse I didn't sign on for all of this

226
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,271
I'm going to call it a day see you where the hell do you think you're going to let me

227
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,767
You told me about your friend you said that his name is right

228
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:13,119
Would you believe that I know a man whose name is Tema also for real

229
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
Is your timer Really Brave too

230
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,775
Yes but he must never fire a gun not if I can do it for him

231
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,175
I don't want him to kill anyone he's a good man killing people is always wrong you understand

232
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,223
Even if they're the bad guys

233
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
Don't ever do what I'm about to do

234
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,743
Close your eyes don't look don't don't shoot

235
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,943
Quick I can put up the fire and use the

236
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
1 million marks

237
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Nina

238
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
Damn it all the cops are coming

239
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,831
Get out go I'll take care of things here

240
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,879
There's a boat over by the river

241
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,183
Please tell me you have to leave now

242
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
My main

243
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,711
Thank you for all your cooperation young lady

244
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,391
Wait one second okay I'll be right back

245
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
Mina you have to promise me something Nina swear to me you will kill anyone

246
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:45,951
Years ago the night I shot my brother I finally know what he meant when he told me to shoot him in

247
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:52,351
Now I understand he's not alone

248
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:58,751
There are two of them inside

249
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,223
That's why

250
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,599
It wasn't your fault you didn't do anything wrong

251
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:19,488
I must

252
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
I have no other

253
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:28,448
I have to shoot you hun again

254
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,712
Hey wait up what the hell are we doing here anyway

255
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
Come on let's get out of here

256
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
Can I give up

257
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
There's no use for this guy

258
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,136
I guess I'll be starving and broke forever

259
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
If only I still had that

260
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
The hell's that supposed to be

261
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
A message

262
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:21,696
The monster inside me about to explode

263
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
What is this supposed to mean

264
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
He has a split personality
