1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,376
One man

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,144
Have a

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,216
Wait a second where's the Cherry

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,288
It's not a Manhattan without the Cherry

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,104
Yeah my

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,432
I'll let it

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,968
This time

8
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,184
Business always goes well when I'm sucking on one of these

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,768
A lucky charm is a lucky char

10
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
Come to Papa

11
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,168
I just hope there's still something of value we're taking

12
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
Well well

13
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
Looking what we've got here

14
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,296
It's a five finger free for all

15
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,904
Wonder if there's anything valuable enough for a connoisseur like Auto Hackle

16
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:44,608
You never know what's going to happen first year issue in Canada for governor next thing you and your wife get shot

17
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
LOL

18
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Down to business

19
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm guessing this is where they kept it safe

20
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
Am I getting the chills this is creepy as hell I've never felt anything like this could

21
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
Could somebody be in there as

22
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,120
What am I so scared about it ain't like me to be a chicken move

23
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Put your hands behind your head

24
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,616
Oh man I can't believe this damn bartender at his fault he forgot the Cherry

25
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,712
I said put your hands up all right all right all right

26
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:36,320
Give me a break on this one officer I haven't taken anything yet I promise

27
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm not a cop

28
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
No

29
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
So you're robbing the place too huh

30
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,536
Well in that case why don't you just put that thing away and we'll have our hands behind your head now

31
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,656
Geez what's with this guy's a bigger boy scout than the freaking cops

32
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
You got to be kidding me thanks for nothing buddy come out of here don't follow me

33
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
Someone like you just get in the way you'll call me down

34
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:16,256
That's right I thought I recognized you you're all over the

35
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
You're the doctor wanted for questioning and connection with councilman Springs Missouri are you a thief

36
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:29,055
But I got something called morals I don't go around killing people you wouldn't know anything about the murders that happened in that house would

37
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,151
No idea so get out of my face will you later

38
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
Hey doctor

39
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
You're some sort of top notch surgeon aren't you

40
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
My brilliant brain just came up with a fantastic idea

41
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,559
Do you think that people meet by chance doctor they don't

42
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
Believe me I know

43
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
I believe in fate

44
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
I think people meet for a reason

45
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,007
And my gut tells me you and I were destined to become partners

46
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,151
Call me crazy but I think a lot of folks in the underground Community need someone like you

47
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,503
You know guys who need to hide out so they can't go to regular doctors for help

48
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,575
Listen you leave the management to Old Heckle here

49
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
I'll make you the world's best underground doctor in no time I'm telling you that you're going to make a lot of money you'll be

50
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,839
Hey hey doctor what do you think you're going

51
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,655
There's something I have to do and it can't wait

52
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,799
Well I'd hold my horses if I were you you want to know about the murders in that house don't you

53
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,151
Well I guess you'd like to hear that I saw the killer am I right

54
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
What did you say

55
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:46,367
Are you telling me the truth you want to know what did he look like I need to know what's the Killer Blonde and about 20 years of age

56
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
What do you want about

57
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,719
Never mind you just tell me about who you saw there

58
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,535
Team up with me and I'd be happy to doctor

59
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
He's on the third floor

60
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
So how did you come to know all of this anyway

61
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
I spent a month checking out the councilman's

62
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
Case in the joint I do my home

63
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,127
Just when I'm ready to make a move the killer beats me to it

64
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,223
15 minutes later I look in the window and they're dead worm food

65
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,831
And when I figured I might be able to Blackmail the murderer so I followed him here

66
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,487
This is all you really need to prove your innocence doc know what I'm saying all you have to do is call the police and tell him

67
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
After that we should go somewhere

68
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,143
Sit down relax talk over a drink about our future together as partners

69
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Hey

70
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:38,335
Stop what are you doing what do you want to talk to him for what did you miss the part where he murders people

71
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,431
Man what is he thinking looking for trouble like that I'm out of here

72
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
However

73
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
A cash cow like him is a rare opportunity

74
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,207
Damn I usually make it a rule not to stick my neck out but

75
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,183
Another hot afternoon isn't it

76
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,815
I have I'm actually looking for someone

77
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
Doctor

78
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,079
What are you doing he's got a gun dummy mother and I

79
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,919
We often used to go walking together

80
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,783
On summer afternoon's a lot like this one there was a long road we took

81
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,135
And alongside of the field of sunflowers but mother's dead now

82
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
This is important so I need you to listen did someone ask you to use that gun tell me was it a man

83
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
Implicit a man it was one day this young man came up to me at a local bar and was he

84
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
About 20 years old with blonde hair

85
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
He was

86
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,079
And he had a Big Bright Beautiful Smile

87
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Called himself

88
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
So he's going by

89
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,527
We met a few times and we eventually became very close friends

90
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
He invited me over to the

91
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,343
The place where he was staying

92
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
It was the estate of councilman Springer

93
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
Did he live in that Mansion until recently

94
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,023
Yes he did for a year

95
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
He said they took

96
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Took good care

97
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
He was like a son to

98
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,471
Wait a minute I had my eye on that house for a month it never saw anyone who looked like that

99
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
They were a wonderful family

100
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
I have a picture

101
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
The councilman

102
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
His wife and me

103
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
However

104
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,479
There was something I couldn't forgive them for

105
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
There was a beautiful area on their property

106
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
A bit of sunflowers in their yard

107
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,463
But one day the councilman cleared it all up in order to build a big

108
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Driveway

109
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:09,119
So when I mentioned to my young friend that I thought it was awful I was delighted to discover he agreed

110
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,215
Wait are you saying you actually killed them because of some flowers

111
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Hardly

112
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,031
There was more to it

113
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
He also told me

114
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
Councilman Springer had a mistress

115
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
That's when my friend looked at me and said

116
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,807
I've decided I no longer wish to live with or be a member of the Springer house

117
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
From now on I'm not a part of that family anymore

118
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,975
Then he proceeded to request of me

119
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
That I erase

120
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
The family

121
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Having a mistress is so an excusable

122
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,215
My mother was someone's mistress too

123
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
She was kept woman you know

124
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,639
Listen listen don't think about all that stuff by the way did or the safest in that house

125
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
I believe

126
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
On the second floor in the library

127
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
All right then

128
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
Talk to you probably shouldn't stick around here

129
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,231
You can erase your past did you know that

130
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:13,375
If you don't like it you can erase everything you can erase all of it

131
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,775
You can reset your entire life if you want sorry I don't agree with that at all you may try to

132
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,847
Forget but no one can simply erase their past like that

133
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
Yeah I guess you're right

134
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
I wonder why I thought

135
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,575
Doesn't make any sense to me now

136
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,903
Why did I think I could erase the past by pulling the trigger

137
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,999
Looking back I wonder why I listened to him and did what he ask

138
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
I think you should go now our talk is over I have nothing more to say

139
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,079
Oh that's right

140
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
Your name is Dr Tena isn't it

141
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
He left a message behind for you

142
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
Do make sure you take a good look at it

143
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
You'll find it in the councilman's library

144
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:12,767
He predicted that you would come here and he was correct about that Eric also mentioned to me

145
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,655
Your Fate has already been decided for you so has mine

146
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Doctor

147
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,847
I told you didn't I

148
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,199
Did you actually shoot this guy

149
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
Oh suicide I got you

150
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
What the hell

151
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
Everything's over when you're dead it makes no sense

152
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,423
Hey doctor there's nothing like living am I right

153
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,799
You know I think I actually agree with you for a change hey what exactly do you mean for a change

154
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,943
Anyway so you're after this killer named Johanna whatever I don't get it I really don't know why you do that

155
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,783
Hey why don't you forget about this nonsense in team up with me

156
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,951
Oh by the way I don't know why but when I try to open the door to this room before it kind of gave me the creeps

157
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
What the

158
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
What's the matter you shaking like a leaf dog

159
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Look at me look at me the monster inside me

160
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,631

Oh come on wait listen to me hey Doc I'm talking to you oh for crying out loud

Hey

00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,511
I just thought you might need some money to run from the cops but I guess I was wrong

168
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
Just getting the car

169
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
This is our first client

Now that's what I call a profitable business

221
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
Well you're wrong doctor

222
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,863
What I did had meaning there was a good reason for what I did

223
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Now

224
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,775
The president of gwe is dead I can finally die in peace

225
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
I really don't mind

226
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871

227
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Counselor

228
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,479
I used to be a lawyer in East Germany

00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
My friend here

We lost our jobs

233
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,743
Do you have any idea what it is like for us

234
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,607
After the wall felt gwe came to the east with their big funding

235
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,191
They barged in and built these factories on our land

236
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
One after another

237
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,055
That was our country Our Land

238
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
Bad no right to do that

239
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
They stepped all over our pride

240
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,503
Well I'm proud to have shot that bastard

241
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063

242
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135

249
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335

256
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:47,423
Are you afraid are you afraid of dying

257
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,823
Well now you know what they all felt like the 12 people you killed that's how they died this is what they

258
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591

Now do you know what it means to kill someone get

260
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,879
Disinfectant is that too much to ask

261

Ontario bleeding is pretty bad he's in a State of Shock from low blood pressure and I can keep my

262
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:21,471
My hand pressed against the wound to stop the bleeding I'm going to have to suture the open flesh here

263
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,871
Needle and thread we don't have that fine then a stapler will do what a stapler

264
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271

What are you thinking if you don't put him down right now I'll tell you pull the trigger if you want but

269
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,671
If you kill me know this you're going to have to carry into the hospital yourself

270
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,335
Put me down

271

00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Put me down dammit

276
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,607
What I did this morning was not an indiscriminate attack

277
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,191
The men I killed for the president of gwe

278
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
His luckiest

279
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
And his bodyguard

280
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,287
And they all had it coming

281
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,615
So you're telling me there were no innocent victims in that shooting

282
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,479
You're talking about that girl at the new

283
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
You already knew about it then

284
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
You knew you shot that girl didn't you

285
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,488
Why did you bother saving a man like me

286
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,400
It wasn't because you were afraid to get shot you weren't afraid to die I could tell by the look in your eyes

287
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
So why did you do it

288
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,312
Why save a terrorist like me why would you even bother

289
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
Because I believe in you

290
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,176

00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,320
