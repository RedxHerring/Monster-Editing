1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:07,168
Bad boy you're such a troublemaker how many times are you going to pretend to run away from here

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,752
You do that again and you'll get no dinner understand milosh

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,776
All right

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,848
You get your hands out of your pockets when you talk to me

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,384
Okay

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,664
You're really mean

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
Yeah was that blonde lady

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
So you said you saw her walking on Dominican street that right it could be that she lives on that street yeah so why didn't you follow her

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
We're all the way home and find out

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,816
I was so hungry my stomach was growling like a tiger here's the deal guys it's up to us to go find out where

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
One lady lives and turn her into the police yeah Mr Grimmer didn't kill Mr pedrov we've got to prove his innocence

12
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
True is innocence if we can do that would see Mr Grimmer sure we're figuring out how to do that right now come

13
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
Milos hurry up and eat your food

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,648
The first incident occurred right up there

15
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
Pedrov's illegal

16
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
It was in this building

17
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:43,072
Someone went up there and shot down the former 511 kinderheim director In Cold Blood

18
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,680
The children who lived there said that a blonde woman walked past them right after it happened

19
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
Pedrov was continuing his experiment here

20
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,104
But he did the complete opposite of what was done at 511 kinderheim

21
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,688
Instead of mental abuse The Children Here were raised with love

22
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
So tell me

23
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
You want to go in and take a look

24
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,112
The police have probably already carted away everything in terms of evidence wait

25
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
What are those on the door

26
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,000
Mr officers Mr Grimmer is innocent

27
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,840
Mr detectives the blonde woman is the murderer

28
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
It's those orphans

29
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,496
The children who used to live here must have come back and posted these notes on the door

30
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
For Mr Grimmer

31
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
Milan boche

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
It's a famous soccer players trading card

33
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,392
To those boys that card is priceless

34
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
How should I react to this

35
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,840
I mean what kind of expression should I make in this situation

36
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:54,240
All of my emotions were taken for me at 511 kinderheim

37
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,384
After that I had to attend another school where I was taught what were appropriate emotional responses

38
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Situations like this

39
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Very difficult

40
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
What's the correct way to react to this gift

41
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,976
Perhaps you should go and pay those children to visit

42
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,839
So you're Mr Grimmer

43
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,935
It seems like I'm always hearing the boys say such nice things about you

44
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,775
The children are out playing in the neighborhood they haven't yet

45
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
They really should be back by now

46
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
Oh here look at this

47
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:38,271
It contains the children's journal entries or rather a lot of letters that they've written to you

48
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,343
Mr Grimmer Let's Play Soccer again

49
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,695
Mr Grimmer I'll teach you how to play soccer since you're not very good at it

50
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,279
Mr Grimmer I can't wait for us to play together again

51
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
Right now

52
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,399
I'm still smiling aren't I

53
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
You know

54
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
I had to learn how to do this

55
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,591
I actually had to learn how to put a convincing smile on my face

56
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,967
I really only spent an afternoon with those boys

57
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,551
They have fun memories of that time I shared with them

58
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
Why do they seem to care about me

59
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
That's because they admire you

60
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
They probably like you

61
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
They like me

62
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,327
You know doctor

63
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,143
I've never understood these things not really

64
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,471
I didn't even know how to react when my own child was dying

65
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
I was asking so many questions of myself

66
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
Should I cry in this situation

67
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
How much should I Cry

68
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,991
Should I wear out loud or mash my teeth

69
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,319
Even now I still don't know how to react to it

70
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
I wish I did

71
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
Mr Grammer we need to talk to you dancing what's going on

72
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
Well what is it what's wrong

73
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,335
We just heard something from the kids that just you orphanage it's terrible

74
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,431
Just calm down take a deep breath and tell me what happened

75
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
They found that one lady we saw that one day yesterday we all decided to go out and try and find

76
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:23,231
And then poor meatloaf well he's gone Milo she's disappeared

77
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
I see

78
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
How interesting

79
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,679
So then let's review all the people who have come to visit you here

80
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,239
A certain middle-aged gentleman

81
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
A long haired Japanese man

82
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
And a tall German man

83
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
That's right

84
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
There's one more thing

85
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,039
I think you may have forgotten another person who came to see you

86
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
According to the desk nurse

87
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,927
A long haired blonde woman came to visit you recently as well

88
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
A woman

89
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
No there weren't any women who came to

90
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Well

91
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
The nurse said she was certain there was

92
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
She said she was a beautiful blonde

93
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
She was very beautiful

94
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
But

95
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
Was definitely a man

96
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
I see

97
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
So tell me

98
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
What's your name

99
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
I'm your

100
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
I wonder

101
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
Have we met somewhere before

102
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
What were you doing when I saw you

103
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
Nothing

104
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
I know your face

105
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,143
You walk around this neighborhood a lot don't you

106
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
What is it you're looking for

107
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
Look for

108
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
My mom

109
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
Why don't you have a seat and make yourself comfortable

110
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
Here have some juice

111
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
Are you about to move out

112
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Why do you ask

113
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
Because you have that big

114
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
And there's no stuff in this room

115
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
So your mother she's somewhere around here

116
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Your mother

117
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
You told me you were looking for her isn't that right

118
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,431
But I don't really know if she lives around here

119
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
Then how will you find her

120
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Do you have

121
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
How come

122
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Too bad

123
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391
You don't even know her

124
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
Oh no my mom when I see your face

125
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,279
No one at the orphanage believes me either

126
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
It'll keep telling me it's not going to happen

127
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,655
But when I see her I'm going to know her face for sure

128
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Count on it

129
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Really

130
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,543
Yeah and my mom will know it's me when she sees me

131
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,807
Even if you did find your mother what if she acts like she doesn't know you

132
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
Thank you were born because you were wanted

133
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:07,327
I mean why were you abandoned

134
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,167
Could it be that your mother left you because she hated you

135
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
No way

136
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,567
There's nothing special about being born

137
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Not a thing

138
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:26,015
Most of the universe is just death nothing more in this univers

139
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,415
The birth of a new life on some corner of our planet is nothing but a tiny insignificant

140
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,999
Flash death is a normal thing

141
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,071
So why then

142
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,911
You think you will want it

143
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
Who wanted you

144
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,223
So what is your reason for living tell me

145
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,551
You're asking about a beautiful long hair blonde

146
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
Oh that would be Anna

147
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,767
So that young woman Anna would you happen to know if she lives in this neighborhood

148
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:15,167
Yeah I think Anna lives in a three-story apartment building go down this alley it should be about two blocks down

149
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,055
She's a very friendly nice young lady she always says hi to me when she sees me

150
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
Ann

151
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:30,015
She's such a nice girl she always has a warm hello and a smile for me what's her apartment number in

152
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Florida she live on

153
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Up there

154
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,903
That's her apartment Window on the top floor

155
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
So if what the boys told us earlier is true

156
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,839
And it turns out the woman who lives here actually did kidnap me Lush

157
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,703
And she happens to be a young blonde lady named Anna and she just might be the one

158
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:57,407
You're right and if this young blonde woman is the person I think she is and I swear this

159
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,807
Will end here now

160
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
Looks like for too

161
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,799
There's no sign of milosh anywhere

162
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
She took him

163
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Didn't she

164
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,247
He was out actively looking for that blonde woman to try and prove my innocence

165
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
What should I do now

166
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
If you know tell me

167
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,975
How is a person supposed to react to a situation this terrible

168
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,399
Those boys got involved in all this because they were trying to prove my innocence

169
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
You can't blame yourself for everything

170
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,591
The boys told you that Milo usually walks around the streets of Prague he's always out there searching for his mother

171
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,407
He must care for his mother an awful lot

172
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
I don't have feelings like that

173
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
When my son died

174
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Didn't feel anything

175
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,415
Many years ago while I was working for a newspaper

176
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
A female coworker suddenly came up to me one day

177
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,351
Told me that she loved me I ended up marrying her

178
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
I've been told that I'd be less likely to be suspected of being a spy if I were married it'd be a good cover

179
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
Soon she got pregnant she gave birth to a healthy baby boy one day my wife went

180
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:39,807
Shopping and left me alone with the baby my son was in his room taking a nap and when I went in to check on him he was

181
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
Stone had stopped breathing

182
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:46,463
I began giving him CPR right away and I called the doctor at the same time

183
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,535
I did everything I should have done to help him

184
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,887
I did it perfectly but my son died anyway

185
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,007
At my son's funeral my wife was so angry with me

186
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
She said

187
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,103
How can you stay so calm when our son is dead

188
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,455
Why aren't you crying didn't you love him you've always been cold like that

189
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:14,111
You've never shared your feelings with me not once look at you you're a heartless machine you can love anyone

190
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
You have nothing in your heart and you have no love for me and then my wife left me

191
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
I have to find milosh you told me that Milo she's the child of

192
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,007
Prostitute worked in a big red light district near the check border didn't you

193
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:37,407
I did if that blonde woman were looking for is the person I suspected is I don't think

194
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
Think she's going to let me Lush live what's worse if she won't just kill him quickly

195
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,415
If this turns out to be who I think it is

196
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:54,815
They'll confront me Lush with the coolest thing possible before finishing him off

197
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
Follow this road

198
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
It will take you to Germany

199
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
Will I see my mom

200
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
Your chances are good

201
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567

202
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
You think that my mom's up there

203
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919

204
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
You go ahead on your own

205
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
You know who your mother is when you see her

206
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,599
And your mother will know just who you are when she sees you

207
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
But listen

208
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,975
If it should happen that nobody calls out to you

209
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,559
And that means you aren't wanted by anyone in the world

210
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
What will you do with yourself then

211
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
