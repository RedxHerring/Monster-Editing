1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,424
And you've been wearing that same shirt for half a week

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,984
You promised you'd shower every other day

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,544
Quit nagging me will you

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,360
You have a visitor in the reception area

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,152
All right I'm going home

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:22,784
Listen you're going to have to make your own coffee okay

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,392
He hasn't had a bath either you'll like him he smells almost as bad as you do

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,184
Give it a rest

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,024
Yeah well whatever

10
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,864
Whose fault is it that I haven't been able to take a bath anyway

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,032
She's completely oblivious to the fact that it's cuz of me that we all still have work

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
Even though this paper has no future

13
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384
No hard is that to figure out

14
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
Sorry to keep you waiting

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,808
Hello my name is Tim masser

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,368
And I've come here to ask you for your help

17
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
She was right

18
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,208
He certainly looks filthy

19
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
I see

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
So you're a doctor huh

21
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,608
Well you don't look like one

22
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,912
Let me get this straight

23
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,472
I just want to make sure that we're on the same page here

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
So what you're saying is that the infamous serial killer who's been executing middle-aged couples throughout Germany has his next Target

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
Heidelberg

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
This particular couple haven't adopted daughter and you're saying that when that girl turns 20 the killer will come

27
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
Take her away

28
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,160
And when he does show up the foster parents are going to be killed

29
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,816
And you have no idea who that girl or her parents are but you want to save

30
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,336
If that's not delusional I don't know what is I'm not joking about this you have to believe me

31
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
What a load of hooey

32
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
Not even a third rate tabloid would buy that story look I didn't come here to sell you a story after the

33
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
Twins Escape they disappeared

34
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,464
It was at least 6 months that went by before the brother was seen in Munich so what's your point huh

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,560
I believe that after leaving the hospital those children must have come here

36
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,144
To Heidelberg together you know this is just your the

37
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
And then the two of them were raised by the twin sisters current foster parents but the brother ran away from home after

38
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,616
Short period leaving the sister behind

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
Why don't you write a novel

40
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,296
Probably won't sell though wait maybe the couple reported a missing child with the police

41
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,880
Or there might be a newspaper article about it from 9 years ago

42
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,512
All I'm asking is to look through your archives from the past 9 years I'm begging you

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
Wait please

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,984
There must be any more victims The Killing has to stop

45
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
Listen to me

46
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
The boss is allergic to technology

47
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
Reduced versions as well as the original archives from 9 years ago and the rest of these

48
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
So the articles that never did make it to print

49
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,704
Thank you very much

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,824
So is that some sort of Japanese bow well domo arigato

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,224
Let me say this this doesn't mean that I believe you I just don't have time to listen show

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
Yourself out when you're done looking you got that

53
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
Why do I always have to deal with the weirdos

54
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
Please please let me find it

55
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
Good morning Nina

56
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
Good morning

57
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,703
You're looking much better I'm so glad

58
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,103
I was really scared when you faded like that you know I guess you really didn't like the boy we hooked you up with huh

59
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,199
No that's not it at all I just felt sick all of a sudden

60
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:45,087
I need to apologize to him I'll never mind you don't have to worry about him trust me

61
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,463
But turns out when I talk to Auto I found out he wasn't your prince charming on a white horse after all

62
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,815
Yeah we asked and he said he didn't know anything at all about those email messages

63
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Really

64
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:05,823
So you're saying that you fainted right after you saw this particular boy at your campus huh

65
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
Well what did this fellow look like

66
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
I only saw him for a second so I'm not

67
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
Really sure

68
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,575
And do you remember exactly what you felt at the moment when you saw him

69
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
I remember I

70
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Logic

71
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Maybe not

72
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
I don't know

73
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
How to explain it

74
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Go on

75
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:48,575
Just take it easy Don't force yourself

76
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
AB

77
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
EV

78
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
I don't know how to put it

79
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
It felt just like when I used to have that nightmare

80
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Absolute evil eh

81
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,935
It sounds more like it has to do with your religious belie

82
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,031
I don't think so I'm not really want to go to church regularly

83
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,895
I think if I see this young man again it might help to clarify things for me

84
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,991
You're thinking this might help you recover your memory is that it

85
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
I suppose that's one way to go about it

86
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,927
But I don't think you should allow this to disturb the peace you now have

87
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,023
It's important you continue to focus on your future and the road ahead

88
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
Don't worry

89
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,447
Just work up a sweat doing your Aikido and your anxiety should disappear

90
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Hey mower

91
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
So did you pull another all nighter

92
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
Yeah by the way

93
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
I'm just wondering

94
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,831
Were you the one who told that person he could use the file room

95
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
That weird guy

96
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Yeah

97
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:59,231
I asked him what he was doing there and he said you would give him permission to look through the archives

98
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
Why you mean he's still in there

99
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,703
Hey you time to hit the road

100
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Hey

101
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
Are you all right

102
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
Come on heat up

103
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Thank you

104
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Good isn't it

105
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
I always come here for breakfast

106
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
So don't you ever eat at home then

107
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
What about your family

108
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
Haven't got one

109
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
My wife walked out on me a while ago

110
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,479
I was always too busy with the work

111
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,575
Before I knew it my wife left with our daughter and moved back with her parents

112
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,951
Do you ever think about trying to patch things up with her

113
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:08,607
Why would I do that she's the one who walked out on me why should I have to be the one to go after her

114
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,959
Well it just seems like you regretted spending so much time at work

115
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
That's complete nonsense

116
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:21,919
Work is priority number one you hear any woman who can't understand such a simple fact is welcome to leave whenever she wants

117
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,735
Sorry about that I didn't mean to pry

118
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
That's right

119
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
None of your business

120
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
Oh another thing please do forgive me

121
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
But you smoke too much as a doctor I recommend you cut back I told you already it's none of your business you're

122
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
Beginning to sound just like that wife of mine

123
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
Well what's so bad about that

124
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
It means she cares about your health

125
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,335
Just mind your own damn business

126
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
Is that Nina's birthday present

127
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
Yes I was finally able to finish it

128
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,855
Goodness I remember when her sweaters used to be this tin

129
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,183
Honey do we really have to tell her

130
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,255
Does she have to know that she's not a real daughter

131
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Why

132
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Just leave it alone

133
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
You're right

134
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
There's no point in telling her that now

135
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
Nina's our daughter

136
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
That's all there is to it

137
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
I'm home

138
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Welcome back

139
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
I am so hungry

140
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
All I have to do is focus on my future

141
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,463
Yeah maybe Dr guidel is right after all

142
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
See you tomorrow

143
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
7:00 p.m.

144
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
Heidelberg Castle for your birthday

145
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Tomorrow

146
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:10,207
Heidelberg Castle

147
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
I'm a very busy man

148
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,583
I've been staring at newspaper clippings with you for 2 days

149
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
I admire your gumption but

150
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
Don't you think it's about time you gave up

151
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Hey Doc

152
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
If

153
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
And I say if

154
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
I were to

155
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
Ask my wife to come home again

156
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,159
Do you really think she would give it another go

157
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
If you kick the habit one day

158
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
What is it

159
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Found it

160
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
11 year old boy goes missing

161
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:01,663
There's a possibility the child has been abducted but there have been no Ransom demands made as of yet

162
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
Address 16 Decker Street someone named Fortner filed a missing person report that day

163
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,159
There should be some more information in here somewhere

164
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
Oh here it is

165
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,607
Oh man what is it what did you find

166
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:26,239
Duck you said that killer would come to take his sister away the day she turned 20 isn't that right

167
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
If the boy in this article is her twin brother well see for yourself his birthday is printed on it

168
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:38,271
Those twins are turning 20 today

169
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Hi Dad

170
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
It's me

171
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
I just finished up at work

172
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,607
I'm going to be meeting up with a friend and then I'll be coming home

173
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
Yeah and Heidelberg Castle

174
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Really

175
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,287
Your mom is making a birthday cake so don't stay out too late

176
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Was that Nina de

177
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Yeah

178
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,455
She's meeting a friend before coming home

179
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
I'm wondering who this friend is

180
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
Nina's a big girl now

181
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Maybe this will help me

182
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
To remember things

183
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
I want to know

184
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Well I really am

185
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
So dark

186
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
What are you going to do if this girl is at the fortuner's residence whatever's going on one thing's for sure they're in danger

187
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:41,247
So I'll call the police and see if they can send over a car

188
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,647
Show up relax nothing's happened yet doctor but if we wait till then it'll be too late look nothing's going to happen

189
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:54,047
Come on is this all in your head hey duck listen up I know what I'm

190
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,935
Talking about I actually went to the crime scene of the fourth middle-aged couple murdered in cone

191
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,335
There was something unusual about those crimes no motive no Vengeance no

192
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,735
Nothing yeah it just seemed like whoever did this wanted to kill for killing sake

193
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:19,135
I've been a reporter for a long time something tells me you're way off base this time around talk

194
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,791
Honestly do you really think a 20-year-old kid could be such a cold blooded killer there's no way a kid

195
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:32,191
Do something like that it's something a whole lot worse

196
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:38,591
Hell that's just it I have a hard time finding the words to describe that case

197
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:44,991
Whenever I tried to describe it the whole

198
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
Nothing just sounds so corny but the truth is how was the devil's work

199
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
Things for certain doc if I had half a chance I'd snuff that guy in a heartbeat

200
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
16 Necker Street this is it

201
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
