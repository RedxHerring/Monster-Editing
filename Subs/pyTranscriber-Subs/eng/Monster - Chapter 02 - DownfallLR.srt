1
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,360
Blood pressure 120 over 80

2
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,640
Pulse 92

3
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,456
I will begin extracting the bullet

4
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
Bullet is extract

5
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,608
Removal process is completed

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
It's a little early to be relieved

7
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,288
We must still reinforce the walls of the damaged blood vessels

8
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
Right

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,872
80 Proline

10
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,576
His current blood pressure is 128 over 72 and his pulse is 88

11
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,904
It looks like he's still under the effects of the anesthesia

12
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,912
Live on kid

13
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,984
Survive and have a good life

14
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
Dr Boyer how did everything go it

15
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
Looks like the procedure went smoothly on your side

16
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,504
Yes the surgery went well at least

17
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
The mayor wasn't so lucky

18
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,928
Really is that so

19
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,256
That's very unfortunate news

20
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,328
You act as though his dying has nothing to do with you

21
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,168
The truth is doctor that you're the one who abandoned our team

22
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
Just before surgery too but wait that child was brought in before what does it matter

23
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
Who came in first the problem is you selfishly left us a man short we had to scramble to cover for you at the last minute

24
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
Somebody died now wait a minute just listen to me

25
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
We're aware that I followed the director's orders and I clearly instructed you to perform that surgery on the mayor

26
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
Did I not however you chose to ignore that order but doctor you have to understand that because of

27
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
Surgery depends on the trust among the entire staff it's a team effort and yet you decided to act on

28
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,408
Tyrone I've already given my report to the director

29
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
You deeply regrets this Inc

30
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,064
This will greatly affect our Hospital's reputation

31
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,416
You have only yourself to blame

32
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,047
So wait please wait

33
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
Doctor Tenma things are looking very good at the moment the boys blood pressure is 114 over

34
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
82 + 84 overall sir the boys vitals are very stable

35
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,551
Well that's good to hear the operation was amazing

36
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
After collapsing on a holiday retreat

37
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
Mel rodiger passed away at the hospital

38
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,551
Infar

39
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,879
Caused by severe infractions of the inner carotid artery

40
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,535
We certainly did everything we could for him but the condition caused intense swelling of the brain and it resulted in the

41
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,263
Will be taken to ensure a new mayor is chosen I've got to get some sleep

42
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Which took place late last night

43
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
The terrorist

44
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Against the

45
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,415
A full investigation is currently underway

46
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
And is still

47
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
In critical condition

48
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
Now the weather

49
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
The whole

50
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,383
Shane I wonder what it'll end up happening to the boy

51
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
On the way I'm just like him now

52
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:20,671
Mrs Reinhardt and ICU is complaining that she's having a hard time sleeping that said do you think we can

53
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Dr Tenma

54
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Are you listening to me

55
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
Oh I'm sorry yes in that case give a one house in tablet please that should help her get some sleep

56
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,199
What is with him today he's been spacing out all day long

57
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
Hey

58
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,367
Dr Becker it's you Alex like you're going through a bit of a tough time there

59
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,439
Come on fish up have you heard anything from the director yet

60
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:01,375
I did try to warn you didn't I told you the hospital is ruled by politics

61
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,519
I knew what I was talking about and if you played your cards right I'm sure your future would have been smooth sailing

62
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:14,943
Oh well I guess what this means is you and I are on the same boat now my young friend

63
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,807
Come on 10 man don't be so depressed

64
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,879
I know you'll get a chance to redeem yourself sooner or later

65
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,975
What do you say we go get some drinks that'll put a smile on your face

66
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
Hold on a second nurse excuse me

67
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:40,031
I still need to get a statement from the girl would I be able to go in and question her now

68
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
Good time

69
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
That girl has disappeared from her room what did you say

70
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,783
Seems like she's always slipping out of her room and wandering all over the hospital

71
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
And so the reason that Eisler Memorial Hospital has proven to be the nation's leading medical facility

72
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,975
He is first and foremost because we're blessed to have excellent Personnel such as yourself and I'd like to take

73
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,375
Take this opportunity to thank every single one of you for that

74
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:42,239
Unfortunately as you all know just yesterday the mayor passed away in our Hospital

75
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,823
Of course as always we did our utmost to save his life

76
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,663
And because of that this Hospital's reputation remains intact

77
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
And I appreciation let's have a round of applause for Dr Boyer and Dr Isen who strive to the very end to

78
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
Try and save the mayor's life

79
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
I looked over your thesis young man you did an excellent job please keep up the

80
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
A good work all right

81
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
Excuse me

82
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Oh yeah

83
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,231
I'm so sorry I apologize for what happened sir

84
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,095
Now now don't worry my boy what's done is done

85
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Director

86
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,703
You did what you thought was best you followed your heart

87
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
Why don't we just leave it at that

88
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
Thank you sir

89
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:54,431
Ladies and gentlemen may I have your attention please now a word from the head of neurosurgery

90
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,039
Please excuse me it looks like I'm being called up there

91
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
No you're not Timber

92
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
Allow me to introduce the newly appointed Dr Boyer please make

93
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:14,143
Your way to the microphone if you wish

94
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
You remain at this Hospital you may do so

95
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,519
But you'd better give up any dreams of furthering your status

96
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,103
It's not possible for irresponsible people such as yourself

97
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,783
I recognize your skill as a surgeon but that is it and you can forget about presenting any research papers at future

98
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
But but sir please listen to me you decide to transfer to another hospital I have no intention of recommending

99
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Sending you

100
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
In other words it's useless for you to Harbor any Ambitions you have successfully tied The Noose around your own

101
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,343
Successful surgery requires teamwork it's only with everyone's help and cooperation

102
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,591
Hey please you have to talk to your father

103
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,991
For me make him see I haven't done anything wrong all I did was operate on an emergency patient who was brought in

104
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
There's nothing else

105
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
Is that the engagement ring I gave you such a fool

106
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,991
Dr Norton you're looking very handsome this evening thank you

107
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
Looking especially beautiful tonight yourself Ava

108
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
It's quite ironic really

109
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,207
I came to Germany after I discovered one of director heineman's papers

110
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
And as soon as I get here it takes me under his wing

111
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,887
So now it all makes sense that paper I was so impressed with

112
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,031
It was probably written by someone else someone he was grooming just like he'd been doing with me this whole time

113
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
I knew that he was really just using me

114
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,759
But I was hoping that when I'd reached a certain status I'd be able to make my own choices

115
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
With what I wanted to work on

116
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
Our priority is to progress as medical Scholars before we save lives don't you agree

117
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
That's not true her doctor's priority is disabled every can after all people's lives

118
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:36,895
He tells me there's a flaw in my character but what about him he says he's a doctor but he's just a greedy Bast

119
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
Bastard

120
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,319
He'd be better off dead

121
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
I have to thank you

122
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,863
I have to thank you because you helped me open up my eyes as a doctor

123
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:02,751
So survive and live a good life after all I did throw away everything in order to save you

124
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
That's how far I went to give you your life back and I would do it again

125
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
You know your name

126
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Don't you

127
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
Your name is Anna Liebert

128
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Isn't that right

129
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,903
I did try to warn you that all this was a bit too soon for her Detective

130
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,975
Isn't there anything we can do doctor

131
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
She saw her parents get shot to

132
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,191
She's fine physically and I think her trauma induced Amnesia is natural given the circumstances

133
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
Is there any chance you might be able to wait to get a statement from her after she gets better not really this is a very difficult

134
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,687
Okay one of the victims was a former East German diplomat

135
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,295
If we're not able to solve this quickly the bka will be all over our back

136
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,391
Those guys always come here after the fact and try and steal the show from us

137
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,207
I haven't got time to take things easy

138
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,863
Oh what if we do this yeah we let her see her brother and then she'll probably be so relieved to see him that it might help

139
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Regain her memory

140
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,239
I cannot possibly agree to such a risky proposition that's completely out of the question

141
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,335
Besides I'm sure Dr tynma would never permit such a thing and

142
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
He's in charge of Johan her twin brother

143
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
Sure feels like I'm getting a runaround

144
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:00,767
Hey Dr Tenma you seem a little bit out of it you all right I mean you are looking awfully tired this morning

145
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,095
I've been so busy with emergency surgeries

146
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,959
Wow it seems like they've been working you to the Bone well ever since you were demoted from Chief

147
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:13,311
Well I don't mind really it actually makes me feel better

148
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
How are you really doing doctor

149
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,247
I'm sorry I've just been paged I need to go

150
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,599
Are you so sure it's a good idea to keep on going like this

151
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
Hard work won't get you anywhere

152
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
Look at this doctor Heine

153
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,815
Look at all the gifts and letters of encouragement

154
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
Yes there are mountains of them at his sister's room as well

155
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
The media keeps reporting on the twins heartbreaking soda after losing their parents and how they're now on

156
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
Brown and this is what we get

157
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:53,503
As far as this hospital is concerned with no one alive to pay their medical expenses and nothing but An Inconvenient now

158
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,831
Now so their story is a pitiful one that works for us

159
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:03,231
It only means this hospital is garnering attention think about it a moment doctor these kids are

160
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,047
Very valuable to us am I right or aren't I

161
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
Yes sir

162
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:12,703
Why don't we do this we'll give the media a photo of the siblings together

163
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,103
They'll probably be thrilled to have something like that yes that's something the media has been requesting for some time now

164
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,503
But the thing is just do it don't be naive it'll be a picture of the orphan sibling struggling Brave

165
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,903
Play the survive under the warm hearted care of our Hospital staff however the boys attending physician

166
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,999
Is it a still too early to allow them to see each other who's on this case

167
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
It's Dr Tenma not anymore

168
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
What's that

169
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,727
There's no need to leave him in a position that's getting so much attention

170
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,311

171
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335

177
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
That's right

178
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,479
Just make sure you follow my instructions all you have to do is rest

179
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,135
You still need regular doses of anti-convulsants and anti-hypertensives okay

180
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:41,535
Anna wake up

181
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,935
What happened to her we brought her in to see her brother and

182
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,335
Then she just she just started screaming and why did you do that

183
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:07,135
But Dr timma take her back to a room doctor boy

184
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,535
The emotional meeting of

185
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
Of the Twins and then release a picture to the media will allowed you to do such a thing I should have been consulted I'm the boys

186
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,335
You've been dismissed as the boys attending physician as of today he's

187
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:32,735
My patient so I made my own judgment that it would be fine for the twins to see each other

188
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,551
Those children

189
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
You can turn them into a media circus we were just following the director's orders and I think it would be best

190
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:48,351
For you not to fight him I say this voice life it's my duty to protect him until he fully recovers well in

191
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Okay just take a look

192
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:04,479
As soon as he saw his sister he reached out to her and began to cry you see he's regained Consciousness and

193
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
What is reacting normally to stimuli

194
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,343
Which means the surgery was a great success

195
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,183
So good job your work is done here

196
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,255

197
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:34,175

198
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:40,575

199
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,975
