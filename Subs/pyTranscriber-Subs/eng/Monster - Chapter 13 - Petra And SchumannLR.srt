1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,888
Petra open up

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,168
Petra

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:12,288
You're going in for a checkup and that's vital

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:18,688
Yeah well if you open the damn door right now it wouldn't be a waste of my time

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,016
Look who's talking you quack

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,112
I've never been to a doctor in my entire life and I'm a healthy woman

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,416
I'm very healthy Woman as a matter of fact

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,720
Now leave me alone

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,536
We got a problem

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,584
Dr Schumann

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
Yes what is it it's a drunk thing he got hit by a car out on the highway

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
When you left it was he still awake I'm not sure but some guy was treating him

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,784
When I left somebody who just happened to be passing by I guess

14
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:08,352
So mind telling me what happened here oh he insist

15
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
I'm so sorry I tried to stop him but he said he needed to take emergency measures because the patient

16
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
A joke to

17
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,848
Well who did he say he was

18
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
I don't know

19
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
He never did tell me his name

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
Oh he did write something on the chart though

21
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,024
The patient kept pleading with me not to bring him to this Clinic because he said he had no money to pay for a doctor

22
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,352
Please take this to cover any medical expenses

23
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
Bastard

24
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
Who does he think he is

25
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,032
Doctor where you going this fellow what did he look like

26
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
He was an Asian man and he had a little boy with him

27
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,016
Doctor what about Mr Fink

28
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04,416
There's nothing more I can do for him only took emergency measures to prevent him yeah

29
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,208
Emergency measures my eyes

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,024
That's stranger patched him up perfectly

31
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,512
Listen dear

32
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,864
You can't keep following me around like this it isn't going to work

33
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,264
I can never stay in just one place and you can't go to school like this

34
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,336
You won't make any friends

35
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
And who is that

36
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
It's you

37
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,992
That isn't what I meant

38
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
Was it you

39
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
What were you the one showing me up in my own Clinic

40
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
Keep your damn money

41
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
Maybe I'm just a country doctor but I take care of my own

42
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,143
I would never stoop so low as to charge that poor drunkard for treatment

43
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
Sir I just you're probably some big city doctor out on vacation I bet you're

44
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,359
Please dispatch you got to go show us Yokel some charity

45
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,271
How's it going come on Peter let's go

47
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,855
I'm not finished with you yet I'm terribly sorry

48
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,439
We're in a hurry we have to get going now

49
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
Faint got injured in a hit and run

50
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
Oh you mean that guy who drinks too much

51
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
We're looking for any Witnesses

52
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,399
Good luck with that one

53
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,775
Oh hey there Dr Schumann

54
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
So how's things doing

55
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,151
Looks like he's going to pull through

56
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
I'm more worried about the bottle doing them

57
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
And you are

58
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
Who am I

59
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Dr Chan

60
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,719
We're alumni from the same medical school

61
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,791
He figured he dropped by The Village while he's on vacation

62
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Dr Chan huh

63
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Have you and I met somewhere before

64
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959
He took care of Fink actually since I was out making house calls

65
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
Good thing he was here yes sir

66
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
Speaking of house calls guess where I went again today

67
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:38,175
Where Hines isn't it obvious I'm talking about your mother Petra my mother

68
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
You need to tell her to come down to the clinic right away

69
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,575
There's no telling what may be wrong with her without a checkup

70
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
There's no way

71
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:51,487
She's too stubborn come on you know that woman won't listen to anybody she's your mother stop acting so flip

72
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Don't worry doc

73
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
Trust me mom's not going to die that easily

74
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
What besides

75
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,423
She raised me so what's left to do

76
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,007
When it's time she won't have any regrets what did you say

77
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Fight your Tong

78
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,103
Petra has plenty of living to do do you hear me

79
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
Why did you lie to him

80
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
Because I never would have made it to think in

81
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,999
No he'd be dead right now if you hadn't stepped in like you did

82
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
Thank you very much sir

83
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,399
You turned white as a sheet when you saw Hines how come

84
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Never mind

85
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,543
Least now I know you're not some hot shot doctor from the city

86
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,127
I'm in your debt sir I really do mean it

87
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
I don't know how I can ever pay you back

88
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Is that so

89
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
Pop in the car I've got an idea

90
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,695
Your splint is misaligned I'll straighten it

91
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,767
This may hurt a bit but just hang in there

92
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
There you go I should do the trick

93
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:11,359
Don't let me catch you not wearing that in the next two weeks hey Doc I made some smooth

94
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:17,759
Apple wine how about we drink to my new cat I think that's an awful idea but I'll have a drink with you

95
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
You in the cast comes off you should be fine 5 days and you can go

96
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
Go back to the fields

97
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
Good news hi Mr Shawna why don't you take some potatoes we had a good crop this year

98
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:39,007
With a truck

99
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
Thanks for the help

100
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:47,455
My specialties internal medicine but I have to be a jack of all trades out here I'm all the doctoring these

101
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
Yeah and there's only one of me

102
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,903
It's wonderful yeah Tranquility is the one thing this place has in Spain no I didn't

103
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
In the land

104
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,839
I mean how much you love all the people in this Village and at the same time how much they all seem to

105
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
I love you back

106
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,935
Love huh

107
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
That ship sailed a long time ago

108
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,103
This is my job and that's why I do it

109
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,687
Well one last stop and you're a free man

110
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,015
I saved the best for last

111
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,087
Yeah just don't quit do you

112
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Quit

113
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:32,511
I don't even know the meaning of the word

114
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
Like I'm talking to a mule

115
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,191
Patrick's the mother of that officer who had you spook

116
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
She collapsed 3 days ago working in the field

117
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,359
I talked her into coming down to the clinic but she changed her mind on the way over

118
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
She's been holed up in there ever since

119
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Not his worrisome

120
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
Not to but in but do you mind if I try talking to her

121
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:02,207
It's not going to make a lick a difference

122
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
Doctor please you have to come down she'll never come out if you keep yelling at her like that

123
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,447
Wake up and that's final I'm not going to stand the possibility of losing you

124
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,383
What I mean is I wouldn't have anyone to fight with anymore

125
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,735
Also I wouldn't be able to eat that goulash of hers if that stubborn old thing passed on

126
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,295
Hey mister how come your face is red

127
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
What did you say you little br

128
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
Please miss Petra open the door

129
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,303
Another doctor are you kidding me

130
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
What did I say it's a waste of time

131
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
So tell me why do you hate doctors

132
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
Why do I hate doctors

133
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,031
I'll tell you why

134
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,335
You play God with people's lives

135
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
That's why

136
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
So I wish

137
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
Sometimes I think it would be great if we were

138
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
And try our best but we make mistakes too

139
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Wouldn't it be great

140
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,743
If doctors could be perfect like God and just heal people

141
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
When I see my patients it's always the same

142
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
On the inside I'm trembling like a Le

143
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
Please miss Petra let me at least see you

144
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
What is it I'm smelling

145
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:43,071
You're cooking up some goulash in here aren't you why you asking you like goulash or something I do

146
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,471
But it seems that Dr Schumann is a particularly big fan of it at least that's what he told me anyway well that's news to me

147
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
I always make it for him and he eats it but he never says a word

148
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
He's very shy

149
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
This looks really delicious

150
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
My goodness

151
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:04,575
My shoulders are so stiff and I still have a lot of food to prepare for tonight's dinner

152
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
Miss Petra

153
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,671
Can you touch your chin down to your chest

154
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
Of course I can't easy enough to do watch let me just check something man

155
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
Four fingers wide

156
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
So what was that all about

157
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Oh nothing

158
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
How is she

159
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
It isn't good

160
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,343
A subarachnoid hemorrhage

161
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Hey

162
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
The fax came in for a murder suspect make some copies

163
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,583
Is your mom okay I heard that she had a fading spell three days ago she's all right

164
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
Yeah that tough old lady is going to outlive all of us

165
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
The first stroke occurred less than three days ago

166
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:04,223
We can still make it but we need to operate immediately can we get a helicopter here in time

167
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,879
Can you do it please if you can perform this

168
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
Me the woman I love

169
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,863
For a second time

170
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
Are you sure that it's Kensington

171
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Positive

172
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,871
All right he probably hasn't gone far set up checkpoints along the highway

173
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,967
If we catch this guy it'll be big Hines yes sir

174
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,271
Prepare for emergency deployment

175
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,623
This is great if things go well I'll get promoted

176
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
Hey Hines you have a call

177
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
This is sign speaking

178
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
The nurse from the clinic

179
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,215
Are you kidding me my mother collapsed again

180
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
God why didn't I drag her into town

181
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,591
If they had checked her at the state hospital I wouldn't have come to this

182
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,967
You're the only one who can save her

183
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
Just as I suspected

184
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,367
It's an aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery

185
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
We don't even have a surgical microscope or a cranial here

186
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,791
I can still do it as long as I have an aneurysm clip

187
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
No it's too difficult even for someone of your caliber

188
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
We've got no other option here

189
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,543
If the aneurysm ruptures I'm afraid she's not going to survive the night

190
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
It's my fault this is happening again

191
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
What are you talking about Dr Schumann

192
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,039
Those aren't the words of a man who single-handedly taken care of this entire town

193
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,623
I don't know what happened in the past but

194
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
You have to do the best job you can do right now

195
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,743
That's all we as doctors can do

196
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Yeah

197
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Hey kid

198
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
Dr schumann's inside isn't he operating why are they doing it here

199
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,039
Convert this Clinic instead of taking her to the hospital in town hey don't worry

200
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,647
How's her blood pressure and pulse

201
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,487
Blood pressure holding study at 1:26/84

202
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Propulses 88

203
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Amazing

204
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,471
He's so fast and efficient even without the benefit of a craniotone

205
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
What the hell are you doing

206
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,967
We're operating on your mother isn't that obvious what are you doing with that gun put your hands up

207
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
Do it

208
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:50,111
If he stops now she'll die is that what you want he's the one trying to kill her

209
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,207
Is wanted for murder he's a suspect in several killings

210
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
He killed a man and Heidelberg

211
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,119
And he's the prime suspect in the serial murders of those couples

212
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
Who would have thought that I'd find you here

213
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:10,591
Leave it to good old mom always looking for new ways to help out our boy now put your hands up

214
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,407
If you don't I'll shoot like hell you will

215
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:20,319
This is a sterile operating room or it was until you came barging in do you want your mother to die of meningitis

216
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
Cuz it's very likely to happen if you keep standing there

217
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
There's a subarachnoid hemorrhage in your mother's brain

218
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
And she's had it for three entire days

219
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
If we don't save her now

220
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
She dies

221
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,431
Now get out of here Heinz no way I'm on to you you're just planning on using my mom as a host

222
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,783
So you can run away from here all right now

223
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
Aneurysm clip in forceps now

224
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,791
That's my mother on that table I won't let anyone hurt her yes Petra is your

225
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
You're her son

226
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,655
But what kind of sun have you been to her these past 5 years

227
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,983
I know you didn't visit her once since you left for the city

228
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,287
She's sacrificed a lot for you

229
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
And what have you done for her in return

230
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
Anything

231
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,455
Listen son the folks we love can be gone in an instant

232
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
Do you remember what your mother's goulash taste like

233
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,903
Even now years later Petra sets out a dish for you

234
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
I should know I'm the one who eats it

235
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
Remember

236
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
How delicious it is

237
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,423
He's giving it everything he's got

238
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,311
So if you ever want to taste that goulash again you'll get out of here now

239
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
Tim was there so it's okay

240
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,111
Blood pressure 140 over 86 pulse

241
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
82

242
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Good

243
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
Her Vital Signs have stabilized

244
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,999
Why don't you get some rest Misty

245
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
Doctor you've been up all day

246
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
God like you haven't I'll be just fine

247
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
Yes sir you did well today

248
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
Doctor timer you should get some rest too

249
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
Don't worry about me I'm fine

250
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,639
You're fine that was a grueling operation you must be dead on your feet

251
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:27,039
I want to stay and make sure she pulls through that way when Miss Petra has recovered enough you can go ahead and finally

252
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Propose to her

253
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,391
What do you mean for pose

254
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
Hey I thought you were supposed to be asleep

255
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
I'm not sleeping

256
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,327
Not until I take him down to the station

257
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
What's he talking about anyway

258
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,447
You're not thinking about marrying my mom are you

259
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Of course not

260
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
Don't be stupid

261
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
Even if I did

262
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,431
I'm not the kind of man who's worthy of proposing to anyone

263
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
I used to work at the University Hospital

264
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
Didn't give a damn about any of my patients

265
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,927
All I cared about was moving up the ladder faster than the next guy

266
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:11,327
I got in good with the director and ended up writing all his research papers for him would you believe it even

267
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Sorry the boss's daughter what a clich

268
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,447
Well I moved up that damn ladder all right

269
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,263
And ignored her like the wrong she was

270
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
If only

271
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,127
I had been a real doctor or showing her the least bit of attention

272
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
I'd have known in a moment

273
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,807
My wife came down with a simple cold at least that's what I wrote it off as

274
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,135
If only I had looked at her I would have seen it

275
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
An intern would have seen it

276
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
Severe liver failure

277
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
Before she died

278
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
She said

279
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
I finally have

280
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
You're undefined attention

281
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:53,311
I don't deserve to love anybody after what I did to that poor woman

282
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
That's not true

283
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,783
You have been paying attention doctor you've been watching over the people of this Village Petra is going to survive

284
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,183
Five this because you were watching

285
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,263
Do you still plan on taking this man to jail

286
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
What kind of murderer would do that

287
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
This is Hines

288
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Get me the chief

289
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Chief

290
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
I made a mistake

291
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
I'm sorry

292
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,559
We should cancel this search

293
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,119
The man I saw before was not 10

294
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,935
He was another doctor by the name of Chan

295
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,751
I thought it was him because he was Asian

296
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Yes that's right

297
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
Yes yes sir I'm very sorry

298
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
The doctor from the state hospital sure did

299
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
I'm surprised

300
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,183
Well of course he did he probably never expected to see such amazing results from a little clinic in the boonies

301
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
Dr Schumann are you really going to let that young doctor leave I was making him something

302
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
But he packed his bags

303
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
I'm left with the kid

304
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Don't go

305
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,199
This town is safe for you there's no need to run away

306
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
Dr Schumann what are you

307
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,623
This is a nice Village isn't it you're right

308
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:49,023
This Village may be a very good place for a boy like Peter here yes but not only for him you could stop running you

309
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,815
You'll be off the radar if you stay

310
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,007
The folks in this Village need more than I can give them on my own together there's no end to the good we could do

311
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
I can't

312
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,383
I'm sorry but I really have to be moving on but why

313
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
Take care of Peter

314
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,967
He's better off here

315
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,367
Can we wait I'm going with you wait please

316
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,184
What's more important than that

317
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
Save countless lives

318
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
Before I do that

319
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,496
As a man whose life I have to end what what are you

320
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,896
You can't mean that no damage you're a good man

321
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
You fought like hell to save Petra's life why you're not a killer

322
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,880
Tim was going to go no matter what you say to him

323
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:55,840
Go take care of him Peter

324
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:02,240
If you stay with 10 amount maybe you can keep him from going down the wrong path go with him and look after him
