1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:06,656
Before the two of them arrived here they only had each other they were truly

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,936
Be alone in this world

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:13,056
They were found walking hand in hand near the border of Czechoslovakia

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,592
Just the two of them

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,408
Shivering all alone in the cold

6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:26,112
I heard that the conditions and the orphanages in East Germany were pretty terrible not all orphanages were like 5

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,160
211 kinderheim

8
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:43,008
Inga deer the bathroom is the other way

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,664
Down the hall okay

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
It's all right it's all right there's nothing to be afraid of now you can go to the bathroom by

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
Self can't you

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
These poor children have never really felt the love of a parent in order

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
In order to develop as a person the only thing you need is love the orphanages of the East Side were truly

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
Horrible places for the children to grow up in everything was so impersonal even this place was only known by the number

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
You'd better believe we did everything we could do within our power so that we wouldn't be

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
Controlled by the government we weren't going to be another 511 kinderheim

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,840
It was a special orphanage controlled by the ministry of welfare and the ministry of the interior

18
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
Do you know what that means no the reality was it was the ministry of the

19
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
The interior's Pet Project East Germany was using that place for experimentation

20
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
On the children

21
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
Experimentation

22
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:38,112
They were running a project that would turn the children into perfect soldiers

23
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
Mental reconstruction

24
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,816
Twisting their minds for science

25
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
They made the children form factions to observe the aggression the fighting and the hate that resulted

26
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
It was an experiment to claw every last bit of compassion out of those children and see what

27
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
Remained can you imagine what kind of adults those children

28
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
Grow up to be

29
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,976
And now the problem is there's no way to prove that anything like that ever went on

30
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,863
Any type of data or secret records all those documents were burned before the wall fell

31
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,471
Everyone who had anything at all to do with the project fled the country

32
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
However

33
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
I've heard rumors of someone who remain

34
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
He managed to clean his records

35
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:38,015
He stayed even though he was the last person in the world who deserved a second chance

36
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,927
He was the man who was in charge of overseeing the Abomination that was 511 kinderheim

37
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
And even though he was actually a pediatric psychiatrist closely affiliated with the ministry of the interior

38
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Your police

39
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,471
The man's real title was that of a district official with the ministry of welfare

40
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
A district official

41
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,823
With the ministry of welfare

42
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,015
Inga are you all done in the bathroom

43
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
Sweet dreams honey

44
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
All right

45
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
Good night

46
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Good night

47
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,047
They were careful to cover everything up

48
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
Especially after that

49
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
Incident incident

50
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
Tell me

51
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,495
I need to know what exactly happened at 511 kinderheim

52
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
I've said too much already

53
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
Such horrible memories

54
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,455
But I have to know you must tell me what happened there please

55
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
Where's my soccer ball

56
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,743
Where is it do you know where my soccer ball went to

57
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
Here you go I have it right here

58
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,615
But you got to hold off on soccer until your wounds heal all right

59
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,455
Batman who brought you in earlier said he was going to pick you up soon

60
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
You just get some rest until then

61
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
I don't know what really happened there

62
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
No one

63
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,303
The East German government at the time placed a strict gag order on the event

64
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,935
It all began with the mysterious death of the director of 511 kinderheim

65
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,079
Soon after there was a power struggle among the instructors there as to who would succeed him

66
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,943
The place was thrown into Anarchy it was utter chaos

67
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,551
They couldn't even control the children it was every man for himself

68
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,951
It's a miracle Johan made it out of their alive then what what exactly happened at

69
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
One one kinderheim everybody there died what all of the instructors and

70
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:06,751
We last orphan except Johan those people massacred each other

71
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:19,551
The world's not a dark place that's a lie tomorrow

72
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,951
Will be a good day I promise

73
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
Excuse me Mr heart money but aren't we going to go

74
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
Go home now no we're taking a little detour

75
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
Back there

76
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:10,751
No no I don't want to go

77
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:17,151
Each other come on now be a good boy

78
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
What do you mean

79
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:36,095
I told you not to let her leave with anyone until I came back didn't I did was that person was the

80
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Child's Foster father

81
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,471
And let me tell you he was very much a gentleman

82
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
Unlike you obviously

83
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,175
Look I'm sorry but that man I wouldn't worry

84
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
That boy seemed very happy to be going with him

85
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
Dana

86
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
I'm here

87
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
They're not back yet

88
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
Hartman's Library

89
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
These photos were taking a different

90
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
But they were all shot at the same location

91
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
So what am I looking at

92
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,439
Yoh

93
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
Who's the man in the photo next to

94
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
Yes that's it every single one of these photographs was taken at 511 kendrheim

95
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,271
And it looks like they were taken over 10 years ago all of the

96
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,343
Instructors and every last orphan except Johan

97
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
Those people massacred each other

98
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,815
Could he

99
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:21,215
Another

100
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Just hold on Peter

101
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
I'm coming

102
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,423
This child is blind to what I show him

103
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Hot mom

104
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
He can't see it

105
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,847
You can't even comprehend what Johan saw

106
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
He's not like him

107
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
It's no good it is failed again

108
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,183
This boy is no Johan

109
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
Every single one of them died here did you know that

110
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
10 years ago

111
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:39,455
The instructors and the orphans all 50 people died

112
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,855
Johann sat here just watching it

113
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:52,255
All happen you just sat here and watched everything

114
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
You didn't lift a finger you just watched

115
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,855
I had to know his secret so I ask

116
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:24,255
Johan what he done and this was how he answered he

117
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:30,655
The piece of oil soap cloth Into the Fire like this

118
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:42,175
Do you get it do you know what he meant by that

119
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,319
I simply added a bit of fuel to the hatred born when people come together

120
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
It was easy

121
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
That's what he told me

122
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,999
Only 10 years old and he said that

123
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
And he did it with almost no effort at all

124
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
He was able to make

125
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,215
50 people kill each other without even moving a finger

126
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
It was you

127
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,407
It was you and your damned experiments that Twisted Johann into what he is

128
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,223
So you think it was us

129
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
I'm sorry

130
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
It wasn't us at all

131
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
We didn't make him that way

132
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,231
It's true that 511 kinderheim was an experimental project

133
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,839
Specifically created to transform orphans into perfect soldiers

134
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
Thinking back on it now

135
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
It really was only a little experiment

136
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
As for joh

137
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
He's no Soldier

138
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Not at all

139
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
He was better

140
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:50,271
He was a natural born leader of men someone who was meant to stand at the very top of the world

141
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,855
There's no way we could have ever created such a work of art

142
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,695
He was beyond human from the beginning

143
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
A veritable monster

144
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Johann made a prediction

145
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:08,191
He predicted that mankind would end up hating itself into Oblivion

146
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
And what do you think Johan's goal was

147
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
Do you want to know what he told me

148
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,223
He said he wanted to be the last person left in this world

149
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
He did

150
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:34,815
My poor teacher

151
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
The future is dark you must try harder to become more like

152
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:48,127
It's a pity

153
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,527
Why are you such a failure

154
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
Why can't you be more like your house tell me why

155
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
Don't you lay a finger on him hurt man get out of here

156
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:13,727
This is our problem it's none of your business just leave Peter come down

157
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:20,127
Sorry Dr Tim that's right

158
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,527
What were you planning to do once you

159
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:32,927
When you find Johann are you going to try and kill him that will be impossible

160
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,279
Don't look so mad

161
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,679
I'm going to let you in on a little secret but in exchange once you hear it you must leave immediately

162
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
We never come back

163
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:56,479
You

164
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,367
Search out a general wolf he's the one who first discovered Johann and his abilities

165
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,439
I'm sure he's still alive somewhere

166
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:19,519
He's the one who brought Johan to us he should be able to tell you something now

167
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Going

168
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,919
You can come with me or stay here

169
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,735
But you have to decide for yourself

170
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
There's nothing to worry about if heart Mount does anything to try and stop you

171
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:42,047
Shoot him

172
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,447
Listen to me the choices her own nobody else can make it for

173
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
Go ahead tell the doctor there's no way you leave me now would you you can't live without me

174
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,039
Because you're my child teacher

175
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
Now you see how it is Doctor Tenma

176
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
You can leave

177
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,999
Where are you going it's all right it's okay

178
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,559
That's good nice and slow

179
