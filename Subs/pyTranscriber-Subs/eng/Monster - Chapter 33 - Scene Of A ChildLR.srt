1
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
That's

2
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:26,880
It'll be okay now little bird it's your home and respect it

3
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
Never again will blood be shed in this Forest isn't that right

4
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
So you don't remember anything

5
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,744
I need you to take your time and try to think back to the roof

6
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,608
Any detail you can remember about what you were doing up there would be helpful

7
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
Martin you have to tell the doctor what happened if you hadn't hit the Eve on the first floor and got caught in the tree you would

8
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
Hi do you understand

9
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
Please Martin just talk to the doctor if you don't we're never going to put all this foolishness

10
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Please try to stay calm

11
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
If you were to die I don't know what

12
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
I just don't

13
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
It's all right mad

14
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,024
I'm here to see that your son gets the counseling he needs

15
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
I know I know it's just look why don't you take this

16
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
Conversation outside

17
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
No Peter I want you to behave yourself while I'm gone and remember you're not allowed

18
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Inside that room

19
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
That boy

20
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
I see your grandson

21
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,024
No I'm just taking care of him for a while

22
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
Hi there

23
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
Hi yourself

24
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
My name is Dieter

25
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
I'm Martin

26
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Does it hurt

27
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
Does what

28
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
That stuff

29
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
All the cuts under your bandages

30
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
When you fell off the roof but that was really scary for you

31
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
Hey what are you doing you shouldn't be standing up

32
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,039
My shoes are in that bag down there on the floor

33
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
Get them for me

34
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
I can't

35
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
You've got to lie down

36
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
Look just get the shoes

37
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,191
Where do you think you're going you're going to get yelled at

38
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,031
Why should I care if someone yells at me

39
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
It's not like I'm afraid to get yelled at

40
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
It's just like he told me

41
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,319
If you come back alive step outside

42
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
The world will be different

43
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,951
Now the world didn't change

44
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
I'm the one who changed

45
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
You see I'm one of the special few who've been

46
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:54,207
I'm so bored

47
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
I never realized how boring this world is

48
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
Hey look out

49
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
Come on hurry up there's really nothing

50
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:25,183
Nothing to be afraid of

51
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,551
What did you do that for

52
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:58,207
Check it out look how scared this guy is Martin

53
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
No just look at him Peter someone

54
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:11,007
Please help me I don't want to die yeah

55
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,407
Yes you're lucky cuz I'm going to let you live

56
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,791
I haven't answered that question

57
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,167
You said you thought that falling off the roof was scary for me right

58
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Yeah

59
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
I did

60
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
Falling wasn't even a bit scary

61
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,079
After all it's just a game

62
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Just a game

63
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
So many people have died cuz of it

64
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,807
But it's so much fun

65
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,599
Who cares about those guys

66
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
Two people stand facing each other on the edge of the roof of an empty building then you close your eyes

67
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
And walk towards each other one step at a time it's like a duel and it doesn't matter whether

68
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
Where you fall or not if you survive you win right play a game like that

69
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:23,455
You do it so that you can bet against fate those who manage to survive are the chosen ones

70
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,855
How can I put this in a way you'll understand the Survivor gets to keep playing over and

71
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:36,255
Over again yeah but Martin why play the game at all cuz everything else is boring that's

72
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,655
That's why but the game is real fun and the best part is playing it again once Fate has made you a

73
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:49,055
Don't you get it and I thought for

74
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
Sure that you must be one of us fine I'll show you if you don't get it after seeing

75
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,855
Nothing you really are stupid

76
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:08,255
Hey hey you're not really planning on going

77
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
Going up to the roof are you yeah cuz I'm chosen the superior will always survive

78
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
Just like him just like who the person who taught us the game you dummy and who

79
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:27,455
He's a friend a friend to all the children who've been chosen

80
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
Now hurry up get over here I don't think I want to stop whining and

81
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
Let's go with me but you need to understand

82
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,655
The scars who did that to you that it was your

83
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:53,055
You still want to be a part of this worth

84
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:59,455
Even after everything they've done to you come on you have to see

85
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
What

86
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,975
Do you think how's the view how does it make you feel

87
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,911
Oh come on there's nothing to be afraid of stand up close your eyes and take a

88
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,007
Stan Dieter

89
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,823
I understand now

90
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,223
I get what you've been saying and I'll make sense to me

91
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,623
I thought the world was filled with darkness that the future would bring nothing but more

92
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,023
I mean like what's your favorite food

93
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
I hate this really good sausage the other day but if I die I'll never get to eat it again

94
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,823
You're such a coward

95
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,663
You're so weak

96
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
And the secretary Miss Meredith is nice to me if I die I'll never see him again

97
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:14,463
They're always things to be scared of learning to deal with that is part of growing up

98
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
10 minutes told me tomorrow is going to be a good day

99
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,263
If I die I will never get to see denim again

100
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:46,463
I'm going to fall

101
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:59,263
Don't Panic just don't stand up yet

102
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
It can't be like him

103
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
I can't feel like you want I just can't what did you say Johann

104
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:18,463
It even scarier game than this one he said that he was going to be killed soon

105
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
He said that he was going to be shot by a Japanese guy

106
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
I was my

107
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
And I walked across the edge of the roof

108
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,431
I'm not kidding I really did walk it

109
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
I wasn't scared at all you know

110
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,599
You're walking was supposed to be walking across from me but when I opened my eyes he wasn't there anymore

111
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
I really saw it

112
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,463
He fell off the building and died right in front of me

113
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
People really die

114
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
Anyone want tea

115
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Thank you

116
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,519
Honestly I just don't know about my son he doesn't seem to understand what he's done

117
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
I'm glad he's still alive but when I think of what poor Yorkie's parents are going through

118
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,503
I just hope you managed to talk some sense into him

119
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
At least he seems to listen to you

120
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,975
She gets on my case like that every day

121
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,791
Seriously she doesn't understand anything

122
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,143
She won't let me out of the house or watch TV or even read my comics

123
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Nothing's worse than boredom

124
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
I'll bring you something to help pass the time

125
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Really

126
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
You may not be allowed to read comics

127
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
But a picture book should be okay

128
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Serious

129
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
A picture book

130
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
That sounds pretty stupid to me

131
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,927
Hey tell me about that freaking new game you said you were playing

132
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,255
You said you were going to be shot and killed like any minute now

133
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
Now that is exciting

134
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,911
So come on when is that Japanese guy going to shoot you spell it Yohan

135
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,919
Herman Hesser

136
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,831
The first edition of Steppenwolf and this our first edition of hofmann's night pieces

137
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,391
To complete anthology of Curtis poetry

138
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,207
This is very impressive

139
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,607
Despite being the head librarian of the University of Munich Friedrich Emmanuel Campus Library I'm simply

140
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
Dazzled by your collection I managed to make my way through life without a proper College educ

141
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:43,615
I made up for this by reading every book I could get ahold

142
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,783
Well your decision to donate this collection is a Priceless gift to the university I cannot begin to express

143
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
Press my gratitude my eyes are failing and I've lost the key Envision that reading requires

144
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:03,583
I'd much rather these books be accessible to your students than sitting here in my private Stacks collecting

145
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,983
Of course you have a number of Priceless books here but I would also prefer to make them available to the

146
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
Oh that reminds me we've just finished arranging storage for them and would it be possible to arrange a meeting

147
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:22,015
At the library to discuss holding a ceremony of some sort well how's the security there

148
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,415
There are a few dangerous organizations we've had to keep an eye on ever since Mr scheuval re-entered public life

149
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,815
We just want to make sure you review your guest list thoroughly wouldn't you agree Yohan

150
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
Of course

151
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,751
It was Johann and Carl who thought up the idea of donating The Collection they'll make all the necessary arrangement

152
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
I'm getting on the head librarian

153
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
Pleasure to meet you

154
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
The pleasure is all mine

155
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,047
This is where we'll be storing Mr schewald's collection

156
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
The general public is not allowed entry

157
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
You've never been here have you

158
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:18,591
Of course will maintain the appropriate temperature and humidity for preserving the books as well as protective measures against

159
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
And stuffed on fire

160
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,687
What an amazing collection of books

161
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
A Real Testament to mankind isn't it

162
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
Oh it's a testament

163
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
You're absolutely right

164
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:39,071
And this is the central Hall where we plan to hold the donation ceremony with your appro

165
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
The library Security will be tightened

166
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:48,031
Just as Mr schewald's assistant requested we want our benefactor to feel safe as possible here

167
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Thank you

168
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,639
I'm sure that my father will be more than happy to attend

169
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
Isn't that right Johan

170
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
Is there something wrong

171
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
No

172
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
It's nothing

173
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
Would you excuse me please

174
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,415
Are you looking for something

175
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Yes

176
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,815
I was on the hunt for a picture book for a good friend of mine

177
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
For a friend you say

178
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
Yes

179
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,447
For a friend in need

180
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
Let's see

181
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,055
Well I think I would recommend this one

182
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
The illustrations are beautiful

183
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Oh yes

184
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,599
But it might be just a tattoo grown up

185
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
I'm sorry I assumed your friend was a bit older

186
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,255
If that's the case then how about this one

187
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
Oh no

188
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
Thank you very much sir

189
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,551
How embarrassing I'm so clumsy this happens all the time

190
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
How about this one

191
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,047
It's a beautiful book I highly recommend it

192
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,191
Did that one catch your eye

193
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
Oh my

194
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
That is beautiful

195
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
Who's the author of this

196
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
I'm sorry may I

197
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
It's a

198
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Sarah

199
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
Moravia publishing

200
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
It's a check publishing company in Prague

201
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,415
There are quite a few talented writers publishing picture books in Czechoslovakia

202
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
I don't think I've ever heard of cheruba before

203
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,327
Perhaps he's just not very well known

204
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
Is everything all right

205
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,431
Help somebody please help

206
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,704
Man this summer heat is really starting to get to me

207
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
Just awful

208
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:12,736
Right here

209
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,536
It'll all end here on this spot
