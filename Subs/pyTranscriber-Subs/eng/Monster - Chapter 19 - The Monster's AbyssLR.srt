1
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,608
My wife and I divorced about 3 years ago

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,656
No that's a

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,936
She divorced

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,960
3 years ago

5
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:13,312
She said that I stopped listening to her and I suppose she was right about that

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,896
This was the only thing I did really listen to by that point

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
My wife said I was broken

8
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,064
She said it was a Voyer peeking through the window and people's innermost thoughts

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
Crazy

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,392
Doctor

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,440
You're abnormal

12
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,256
Maybe you're right about that

13
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,608
I became transfixed obsessively gazing into the abyss of the human heart

14
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
I suppose it's possible the Hibiscus is back into me the depths of the human mind are filled with treacherous landscapes

15
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,872
Your fourth victim was an 18 year old girl in Munich I believe

16
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,408
I'm curious

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,992
Did you experience any form of sexual arousal when you cut her up

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,416
I don't want to talk about her today doctor I want to talk about my 12th

19
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,208
Fair enough then

20
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,536
That would be Mrs Hunter Kemp from Krupp house

21
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
52 years old

22
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
At that time

23
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
I was in

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,960
I'm not prepared to talk about her

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,360
I promise we will eventually get to Mrs Kemp but for the moment I would really like to focus on victim number 11

26
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Is that all right

27
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
No then

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
Peak of your arousal

29
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,064
Does that come before or after you commit a murder

30
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,712
The victims were all girls with long hair

31
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
Ages 16 to 18

32
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,136
Clear these murders should all be categorized as acts of sexual homicide

33
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
But then he

34
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
Confesses to the murder of his 12th victim

35
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
This is Kem

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
Mrs Kemp was 52

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
And showed no signs of sexual ass

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,216
He claims to have killed Mrs Camp as a favor for a friend

39
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,568
And obvious in Desperate last ditch attempt to disrupt the investigation

40
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Who is it

41
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
Who is it I know that you're in there

42
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
It's me Rudy

43
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
This is a surprise

44
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Yeah I know

45
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
I'm sorry for barging in on you like this Rudy

46
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
You've heard about my situation

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,456
That's putting it mildly

48
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Well

49
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Do you think I'm a serial killer

50
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
I don't know

51
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
But from what I've heard

52
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,488
Both the newspapers and our old classmates think you're as guilty as

53
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
So the question is

54
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
What are you doing here

55
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Why come to me

56
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
We were never exactly what you'd call close

57
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
I know for a fact you despise me

58
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
I could tell from the way you looked at me

59
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,687
I saw the contempt burning behind your eyes

60
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
Haha that's what this is all about

61
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
You've come to collect what you think I owe you

62
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
Is that it it's not like that at all

63
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,999
You've become a noted specialist in criminal psychology

64
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
I have something

65
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
I'd like you to take a look at it

66
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
My dear Dr temma

67
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Look at me

68
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Look at me

69
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
The monster inside me is getting bigger

70
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Help

71
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,223
The Munster inside me is about to explode

72
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
What on Earth is this

73
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Quite a story

74
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,791
So 10 years ago you saved the boys life who went on to kill the hospital directors some staff and his foster parents

75
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
Then he's gone

76
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,655
Leaving no Trace other than a series of cryptic messages addressed to you

77
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,727
Which is why it's so urgent that I find out where he is now

78
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,359
Because you think by finding him you'll also find something that might prove your innocence

79
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:43,295
20 years ago

80
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,623
There was a young man attending a prestigious medical school

81
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:53,535
He was driven to be top of his class one day a Japanese transfer student came and changed

82
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
Everything

83
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
This new student was Charming quickly gaining the respect of peers and teachers alike he had a brilliant mind as well

84
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:08,127
No claiming his position as the top of his class within his first semester much to the men's dismay by

85
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
By the next semester he had become obsessed with regaining his title he had managed to earn full marks and all his classes so

86
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,087
How far however

87
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,695
His last test was in his weakest subject medical law

88
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
If he failed this test then all of his efforts would go to waste

89
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
So he resorted to Desperate Measures measures

90
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
God would put them back on top but he was caught

91
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
The Japanese student never

92
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
Told anyone about what he had seen

93
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
As a result

94
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,231
The man regained his throne

95
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,631
So is there anything you can tell me about this man based on the contents of these letters

96
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,191
You think it may be multiple personality disorder

97
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,895
And you've come to the conclusion that one of the personalities is committing these murders while the other personality is trying to get

98
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,295
Yes instances of serial killers leaving these sorts of notes or not unheard of

99
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,415
Just as often these notes are fabricated as legal proof

100
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Of their insan

101
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,351
Separating The Pretender from the genuine article is the art of the criminal psychologist

102
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
I believe you me this is no easy task the introverted shifty-eyed serial killer is more or less a Hollywood fabrication

103
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Many killers are highly intelligent intuitive and extremely Charming they are

104
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
Adoptive and skillful Liars

105
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
So that's it

106
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439
Think he might be toying with me well let's not add to the mounting pile of conjecture just yet

107
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,023
Why don't you tell me a little bit more about this Johan

108
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,607
My wife and I got divorced about 3 years ago

109
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
What I mean to say is my wife divorced Me 3 years ago

110
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Thank you Rudy

111
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,199
I need to do some research give me a call next week all right

112
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
Do you have an opinion about this person

113
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Seems like my kind of guy

114
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
Can you elaborate on that

115
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
The monster

116
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
I get all that

117
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
That's interesting

118
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
You get the monster

119
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,959
Makes sense of course there's a monster inside both of you

120
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
To be fair there's even a monster inside of me

121
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Shut your mouth

122
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,175
That's nothing but textbook garbage

123
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
What I'm telling you doctor is that a real monster does exist

124
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
What do you think you're doing just stop looking at me like that

125
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
Don't you dare look at me

126
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
What are you doing

127
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:22,431
I'm telling the guards

128
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
Are you scared

129
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
Because there are things out there that would turn your blood to ice

130
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:41,631
I'm going to tell you a secret

131
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Operation

132
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,495
You really still convinced that Tim was going to try and contact you again

133
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
I'm sure

134
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,103
And when he does he'll notify you immediately

135
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
However

136
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
Well go on

137
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:00,319
After his arrest I would like to get permission to use him and his case in my research

138
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
Doctor Turner would make a compelling subject

139
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,951
He has a complex Criminal Mind

140
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:20,031
I'm going to tell you a secret go

141
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
Sonic Kim's house in group house make your way to the basement you're going to find all of your answers down there

142
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:37,439
Down there you'll find proof proof the monster

143
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
It really does exist

144
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
This is Rudy

145
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
I've been waiting for your call

146
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
Yeah all right

147
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Excell

148
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
And I'll see you there

149
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,759
Officer call Tim I just called we've arranged for a meeting tonight

150
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Odell Park tonight at 8:00

151
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
By the fountain that's right

152
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Goodbye then

153
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,655
I'm currently retracing Jurgen steps on the day of his 12th confessed murder

154
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
According to our interviews he broke into the basement

155
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
And stayed hidden there for several hours

156
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Later when Mrs Kemp returned home

157
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,455
He made his way into the upstairs bedroom and murdered her there

158
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
There's nothing out of the ordinary

159
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Except

160
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,463
There are framed photos

161
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
All over the basement

162
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
Their own pictures of Mrs Kem

163
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
Just a doll

164
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
Almost gave me a heart attack

165
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,271
Evidence of this so-called monster Jurgen sent me to find clearly isn't here

166
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,879
The supports my theory that Jurgens committed the 12th murder to confuse investigators

167
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,231
His first explanation was that he committed the murder as a favor for a friend

168
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,559
One he Associates with a primal monster archetype

169
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,623
When I was a kid

170
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
My mother would beat me

171
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
What she would do

172
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,399
This big dog

173
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,503
The basement wakes up

174
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
Wherever I

175
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,607
What does it mean exact in every detail

176
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:31,007
Is it possible did Jergens actually recreate the basement from his childhood

177
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
The boy next to Mrs Kemp

178
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:50,207
It can't be there's no evidence connecting young Jergens to Mrs Kemp

179
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:56,607
Something is not right here

180
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
Into the photograph

181
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
This one and this one and another

182
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,439
All of these Mrs Kemp never had any children

183
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,791
So who is this boy

184
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,447
Who are you down there you'll find proof proof the monster really

185
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
Does exist

186
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,615
I followed all of the instructions and my friend left me in the letter perfectly

187
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Who was he

188
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,551
Just listen the first letter came in a blank envelope without a name or return address

189
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:52,671
He would just say he understood me sympathize with me crap like that

190
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
I was annoyed

191
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Angry at first

192
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
But then another one came

193
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
And then another the next day

194
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
And again and so on

195
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
He's a letter

196
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,055
But before I knew it I started to expect the letters

197
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
Even enjoy them a bit

198
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
Then I thought

199
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,503
Maybe it's possible he might actually be a friend to me

200
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,599
And then one day one of his letters asked me for something

201
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,183
He asked me to go down to the basement of this house

202
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
Did the basement belong to Mrs Kemp

203
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,655
I still don't know how he could have known

204
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,799
There's no way he could possibly have known what happened to me down there when I was a kid

205
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,151
Somehow he got everything right down to the smallest detail

206
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
How do you do that

207
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
I just got so confused

208
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:58,207
The next thing I knew I was upstairs and Mrs Camp was dead

209
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:04,607
He's a letter freak as well

210
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
What is this another

211
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:28,159
And this another one

212
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,487
Look at me look at me

213
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,559
Let's try inside me is getting bigger

214
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
Help me the monster inside of me is about to explode these are the messages

215
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
You said Johan left me

216
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
They're the same

217
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,575
Jergens's friend and your hot is

218
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
Anything yet

219
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
It's way past eight already

220
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Inspector call

221
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
Target in sight

222
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
Asian male

223
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Long hair

224
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
I appreciate you making time for this Rudy

225
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,719
I want you to know I did research what you gave me

226
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,279
But I thought you were making it up

227
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,911
I thought that Johan was just a ruse a scapegoat you created to buy you time once you were caught

228
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
You've got to believe me

229
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Rud

230
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
I've been conducting research on a serial killer named Jurgens and something he said caught my attention one of his vict

231
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,479
Symptoms is off pattern showing no connection to profile or ritual

232
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:03,135
It doesn't matter Rudy please just listen to me okay listen up everyone will finish for today

233
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
I will see you tomorrow seems like the carnival is wrapping up

234
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
Everyone in position

235
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,815
Make sure they're ready to move in on my mark

236
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Yes sir

237
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
I want every detail of their conversation

238
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
10

239
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
You hated me didn't you

240
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,591
You've hated me ever since you caught me cheating on that exam in college

241
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
I could feel your dis

242
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Go ahead and say it

243
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
Inspector coal this doesn't look good

244
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,135
Dr Gillian and Tenma are headed toward the west exit

245
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,975
Will lose them and that crowd that's leaving

246
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
You'll be well within your right

247
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
A man like me doesn't deserve your respect

248
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,655
Rudy this isn't the time to remin listen to me

249
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,007
Now then I looked up the answers and wrote them all down on a cheat sheet

250
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
She just like this one

251
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
Run we're surrounded by the police

252
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,247
Don't look just walk

253
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
Is Dr Tema threatening Gillen I'm not sure sir there's too much background noise for me to hear

254
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,303
Hey is my turn jurgen's recently confessed to me that he had killed Mrs

255
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
Camp at the request of a friend

256
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
Rudy what is this

257
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
Something I found in Mrs Kemp's basement

258
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
But Mrs Kemp never had any children

259
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:34,783
I have found compelling evidence to suggest that jurgens' friend and your Yohan are both one and the same

260
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
They've passed through the West exit

261
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Should we move in

262
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,255
Tell everyone to hold their positions he may be armed

263
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,143
I found a letter from Johann and Mrs Kemp's house it was almost identical to the one you brought me

264
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,543
I believe that Johan had been in the care of Mrs Camp at some point in his life that would explain his

265
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,943
Motivation for orchestrating her death you're an innocent man

266
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:09,343
I'm sorry I can't give you as much detail as perhaps you'd like but here's what I've worked out on

267
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Yo hun so far

268
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,231
I don't know how he does it but Johan can somehow identify other killers

269
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,839
He finds them worms his way in beguiles them then manipulates them

270
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,191
It is worth noting that to the best of our knowledge

271
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,591
He hasn't killed the foster parents who cared for him as a teenager probably because by the time he reached that age

272
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,895
Longer found himself dependent on anyone

273
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
Perhaps

274
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,711
But I have another theory

275
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,807
What if Yohan found himself his ideal family

276
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,463
And then became a part of it but why work so hard to erase his past was there an UL

277
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:53,119
If that is indeed the case did he make his way into the family for a specific purpose

278
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,679
And what would that purpose be

279
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
Well

280
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
We're at the bus terminal

281
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,919
Yes confirm which bus Tim is getting on

282
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,759
They get a car over to the terminal and have him follow yes sir

283
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,647
At least I can do is buy you a bus ticket

284
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
You know

285
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,560
There's still time for you to turn yourself in and prove your innocence I promise I can help you

286
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:29,216
The truth is I'm not chasing after your hunt just so I can prove my innocence

287
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
Thank you for all your help Rudy

288
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,408
Cinema you don't have to become him to end this

289
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
That reminds me

290
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
I really didn't despise you back in college Rudy

291
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:48,672
I mean it I thought you were brilliant and it was a shame we never had a chance to talk I'm glad that I can

292
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
Finally count you as a friend but I know you caught me cheating on that medical logs and there's no doubt about it

293
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:01,472
I saw you looking directly at me and my cheat sheet well yeah I cheated on the medical

294
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:20,672
Be careful tema
