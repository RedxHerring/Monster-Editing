1
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,656
Why are you crying

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,216
It's just my friend's letter

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,288
My very best friend

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,616
When I was 15

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,944
The two of us decided to cross the check border together

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,992
But my friend was captured

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,296
And she was taken back to Prague

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,392
She says she's doing fine

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
She's been such a good friend

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,000
She knows me better than my parents do

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
Or even my siblings

12
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,632
With the government's tough inspections and censorship

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,448
Who knows what she went through to get this to me

14
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
She

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,288
Please visit me if you have the chance

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
I miss you so much my friend

17
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
Near cheddock Bridge

18
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
Inside the three frogs

19
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
I want to go back

20
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,600
Oh my

21
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984
Just for tonight

22
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
I want you to call me by my real name

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
I am

24
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
Helenka Novak

25
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,344
For tonight I'm no longer Margo Langer

26
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,576
I sold my stock Holdings and Razer Burger Pharmaceuticals at the right time and then when I bought some

27
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
Talking neuter Laboratories

28
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
But I really hit the jackpot

29
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,256
Well I wanted to celebrate so I did

30
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
So you had a drink

31
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
Sure just a little

32
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
That wasn't too smart

33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,264
All I had was wondering what an alcoholic like yourself that was a foolish choice you made

34
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592
In your case it doesn't matter if you drink a little or a lot

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,712
Another thing that concerns me is it seems you stopped going to your group meetings as well

36
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
So

37
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
By the way

38
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
You can keep a secret right

39
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,184
I've got this special woman I want you to meet

40
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,768
Have you gone and found yourself another mistress

41
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,864
Not really look this one's got a serious issue with alcohol

42
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
She's waiting just outside could you see her for a minute

43
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
I don't do counseling that way

44
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
Have her make an appointment to see me

45
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
Come on just see her for a few minutes

46
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
I'm making a house call next

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
For a very important client

48
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,552
I took a few days and went to Prague in the Czech Republic

49
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
I found it a very nice city to visit

50
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
I saw Prague Castle

51
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh and the wonderful Gothic cathedrals

52
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,303
It's such a beautiful place when the Old Town Plaza is all lit up

53
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
It's just like a land out of a fairy tale

54
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,679
What about sheddock Bridge

55
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,519
Did you go and visit the chetak bridge I did

56
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
Exactly as you told me to do

57
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
Here it is

58
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,687
See I took a picture of the sign with the three frogs

59
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
And the woman was she there

60
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,647
No sir in fact no one was living there

61
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,255
Unfortunately I didn't find any useful information for you by going there

62
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
It was so frustrating

63
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
I didn't find Tenma

64
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
Or any good leads on Dieter and Nina

65
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,543
Here

66
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
Take this

67
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
It's a rabbit's foot

68
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
It's for good luck

69
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
Now listen

70
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,575
Please give it to our child after it's born

71
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Margo

72
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
No

73
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Helen

74
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
You must know

75
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
I thank you

76
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,119
Excuse me ma'am

77
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,983
I've come from Germany and I'm searching for a missing woman who might have lived around here a while ago

78
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,079
Do you know young woman by the name of Margo Langer

79
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,407
Wait sorry her real name was helenka novakova

80
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
Helenka

81
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Anyway Mr schewald

82
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
Your son Carl recently gave me a call

83
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,487
He expressed some concerns to me about the fact that you haven't been eating properly

84
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,887
I classify that experience you had at the library fire as traumatic

85
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,215
A near-death experience can change one's life you know

86
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,823
I sense that paralyzing fear still hasn't left you

87
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
But you're very blessed to have Carl here with you

88
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,247
He's a wonderful thoughtful and loving son

89
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
You really have nothing more to worry about

90
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
Please do try to eat regularly won't you

91
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
The monster

92
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,815
As long as that monster exists

93
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
It's so difficult

94
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,471
How did he know so much about Margo

95
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,799
Where could he have obtained all that information

96
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,127
He knew much more than Carla I did

97
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
Years ago Margo told me of this girlfriend she had who knew her even better than her own siblings

98
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Your parents

99
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
I remember that conversation

100
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
This was the woman who Margo exchanged letters with now in the 1980s you began to search for Margo

101
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
At that time had gone missing

102
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,399
You went to Prague and actually met that woman didn't you

103
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
I did

104
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:41,823
Considering she was supposed to be Margo's best friend I assume that woman might have heard something from her

105
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
I was wrong

106
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431
She said she didn't know where Margo was

107
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,807
But for a while we did talk quite a bit about Margo as we stood in the door

108
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
And that's when

109
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
They were listening

110
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Listening in on every word

111
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
Who do you mean that quietly listen to what we said they stood behind the woman

112
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,959
Absorbing it all those twins

113
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Yes

114
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Come in

115
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
Welcome have a seat

116
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,527
You're the young lady Mr thalbach wanted me to see aren't you and you're a compulsive drinker

117
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,183
Please just relax today all we're going to do here is have ourselves a nice friendly chat

118
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,583
What is it Meredith can't you see I'm right in the middle of a session

119
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,983
Excuse me for a second repeating or breaking news story check police have Ann

120
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:59,391
He's a witness and possible suspect in the poisoning of three doctors at dusseldorf's Isler Memorial Hospital

121
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
He may also be connected with the murders of the journalist Maurer and the Fortner couple in Heidelberg and the Phantom killing at

122
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Heidelberg Castle

123
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,215
For now these are all the details we had him the police

124
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
I'm here

125
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
Miss heinemann

126
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Cancel

127
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,711
I'm sorry for being late everyone

128
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,295
Why Mr Hess you look 10 years younger

129
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
Playing with my grandchildren is keeping me young

130
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
Huber how you been

131
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Fine

132
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
I'm actually finishing up my final Academic Year

133
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,815
I hear you're pretty busy too Mr Kiefer

134
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,703
I was bragging about you saying how I'm friends with a screenwriter who's going to

135
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,055
I just happened to catch the eye of a producer who has a big imagination

136
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:53,919
My first story idea is in development in my mind's brimming with new plot lines

137
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:59,551
You're on your way no that's surgery saved my life

138
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,415
If my surgery hadn't been a success I wouldn't be here to hear you laughter

139
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
Thanks to him

140
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,815
And I never would have walked in the park with my grandchildren

141
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
Think of that

142
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Right there

143
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,775
He always sat over there by himself drinking his tea

144
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,615
Other doctors went to nicer cafes but he came here

145
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,943
Because it was closest to Eisler Memorial Hospital

146
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
And when we patience would come in here

147
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,575
He would look at us as he sat there

148
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
And smile at us

149
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
He was the kindest doctor

150
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Yes

151
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
A great doctor like him

152
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
He would never do this no

153
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,215
And that's the reason why I've gathered all of us here today

154
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,311
The others who aren't here said they feel the same as we do

155
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,127
After all they were doctor 10 most patients too

156
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,783
Bad news Dr Schumann Mr Merkel just collapsed sir

157
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,183
I'll be right over but I'm busy at the moment you better go and wait for me there all right

158
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Really

159
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,351
Dr Tim I wouldn't do those things calm down and listen to me Mom

160
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
Please dear go to him quickly

161
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
Picture I can't just

162
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,591
Don't you give me any butts Dr Tema has been charged with a crime he didn't commit

163
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,687
If he hadn't been around you know I wouldn't be alive right now

164
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:37,599
My dear Dr Schumann are you so heartless that you don't want to help the man who saved your wife's life

165
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
Then what will happen here

166
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,255
You know darn well I'm the only doctor in this Village

167
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,095
What will happen to everyone that lives around here if I go and leave town

168
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:54,495
You want to go don't you quit your blabbering and get going right now Dr Tim I need your help

169
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,847
I took an oath and if there's a patient who needs me I can't just leave him

170
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,919
That's the way Dr Tema would have behaved

171
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
Please doctor would you see us now

172
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
Be patient I need a little more time

173
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
Don't want to hurry up

174
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,743
Stop your whining the doctor is taking a big risk by practicing without a license while she's going to school

175
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,959
When you're in the darkness you only sink deeper into it

176
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
Keep the lights shiny

177
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:33,407
You've got a real gift for this you'll make a fine doctor

178
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:51,071
All right I'm ready to start now whoever's first come in

179
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Lawyer right

180
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
But father wait

181
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,543
We still have no way of knowing exactly where in Germany Tema will be sent then we'll have to retain a lawyer that

182
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,943
Like to defend him in any of the German states get us the best criminal attorney

183
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
Yes sir we must have 10 I have the feeling that he is the only

184
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,951
One who can do it he's the only one who can get rid of the monster

185
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
We need strength in numbers

186
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,655
Well let's try calling in more of doctor tennis former patients

187
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
As individuals what we say may not matter much

188
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
But as a group we might just that's right

189
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,431
Let's ask Isley Memorial Hospital for helping getting organized and we could ask them for funding too forget it

190
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
That's impossible

191
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,063
Isler Memorial Hospital is not about to help you with something like that

192
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,623
Hey

193
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,951
I've been listening to all of you and it's quite a touching story

194
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Really

195
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
But come on folks

196
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
Be realistic about the situation

197
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,911
How's the doctor Tema fan club going to prove his innocence

198
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,567
Dr Becker it's you you know Tim I had no alibi and unfortunately he did have a motive

199
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,919
The police even came out and said they found physical evidence at the scene of the crime

200
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
Even if you hire a brilliant lawyer to defend him

201
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:17,599
And you gather a ton of people to make a lot of noise it's not going to help

202
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,927
No matter what you folks do on Doctor 10 most behalf

203
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,975
It's impossible to prove that he's innoc

204
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
I do ask you

205
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Anyway

206
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
It's a real shame about his career

207
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Yeah

208
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,615
It's a real shame I'm going to ask you again Ava

209
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,735
What's your relationship to Tenma

210
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:51,135
Look Miss heinemann I don't know who you are in all of this but I'm on this train because

211
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,279
Cuz I mean to save doctor Tenma so I don't want you coming along if you're here just to do some sightseeing

212
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Ava Heineman

213
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,935
Heinemann Miss Heineman

214
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,007
Could it be that you are are you the daughter

215
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,871
Dr heinemann the murder director of that hospital in Dusseldorf

216
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Dr tema

217
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,527
He had quite an effect on me you see he destroyed my life

218
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
And yet

219
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
I'm the only one

220
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,439
Hooking really save him now

221
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
I saw so what

222
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
Dr Kenzo t

223
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:43,103
Prime suspect in the serial murders in Dusseldorf and Heidelberg is still in custody in Prague

224
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
However

225
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,967
Officials have said he will be extradited to Germany as soon as possible

226
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
He will most likely

227
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:57,439
Is it possible

228
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
This is Dr Tenma

229
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,119
He's the one who saved your life sick you're alive right now because of his first aid treatment

230
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959
It turns out Dr 10 was also been framed for a crime he never committed

231
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
I guess you two are in the same situation huh

232
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Save my life

233
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
He's going to the same ordeal as me

234
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
You're a detective aren't you act like it

235
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:27,135
You have to calmly dissect and scrutinize everything there is really only one way to prevent yourself

236
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:33,535
From being betrayed all you have to do is doubt the person you believe in the most

237
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
I've got to go

238
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:47,103
I've got to get to the Prague police station and talk to 10:00 no matter what it takes

239
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,503
There you are sick

240
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
Well then

241
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807

243
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
My God you must have gone through a lot

244
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
You've been exonerated Sook

245
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
The letter was sent to the station

246
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
This is a copy of

247
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
A letter

248
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,031
It's a handwritten confession

249
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,103
It has details of the events that only the killer would know

250
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,431
So you've been cleared of all suspicion

251
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
Who sent that letter

252
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
A journalist who goes by the name of Grimmer

253
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
Did you say grandma

254
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:32,671
Yeah Grandma's been put on our most wanted list he's now our chief suspect

255
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,023

265
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Oh

266
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,863
Are you talking about Dr tema's arrest

267
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
You know it didn't

268
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,831
10 mobile will be arriving at Dusseldorf tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

269
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:41,183
Since you're in charge of this case you'll need to meet the check police to take him into custody

270
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
Dispatch someone else to take care of it

271
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
Prague is a very nice place

272
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
Please understand sir right now

273
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
I'm still on vacation

00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
Now let me see Dr Tenma

275
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,295
As I've been telling you sir you cannot see him

276
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,951
And why not I thought this country is supposed to be a democracy doctor Tenma is already in the process

277
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,535
Stop being extradited to Germany I just need to see him for a minute

278
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:24,191
We came on that way for nothing all that time and effort what a stupid waste let me see him

279
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
I'm begging you

280
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,543
On your feet

281
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
Come with us

282
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,279
When we interrogate people what type of person do you think

283
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,559
The hardest time

284
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,167
People who remain expressionless no matter what we say to them

285
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,007
People who don't say anything at all

286
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,591
That's the hardest kind

287
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,903
A love letter from the monster to the beauty

288
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,976
This appears to be a draft for a novel

289
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,352
I've been watching you

290
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,168
I wanted to devour you whole

291
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
But instead

292
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
Everything about you consume me when I was falling apart how

293
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
How did I look to you

294
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,016
When I was falling apart the object you gave me

295
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,088
You left me a beautiful Jewel

296
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,928
Those twins who look as if they are blessed with eternal life

297
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:56,608
The most sinful deed is to take away a person's name let's get your name back

298
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,520
I'll give you your name back your name is Anna

299
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:09,920
Right now I'm sad sad sad

300
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,272
Sad

301
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
It exists

302
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,136
There are many people that met their end in that room

303
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:25,536
And then a horrific monster was born
