1
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,704
Domo you're cooperation is greatly appreci

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:09,984
Thank you

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,520
It's a pleasure doing business with you

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
Perhaps the next time we meet it should be over a round of golf what do you say to that all right but only if you promise to go

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,272
No easy honest of course I'm looking forward to

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
Oh Domo

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
Dom

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,112
Dom

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,952
Double this double that

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,048
It's a fairly comprehensible culture

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:38,144
Domo domo apologies for the wait

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,704
My meeting ran a little longer than expected

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,056
The name is he why of the carterfuku corporation Munich branch

14
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,896
Inspector lunge of the bka

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Pleased to meet you

16
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Domo

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,368
A demo and a bow

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,904
That was unexpected

19
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
Coffee

20
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,024
Oh and a refill for him too

21
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,888
My apologies I know you were expecting to meet with Yamamoto today

22
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:14,752
There was an emergency in the Czech Republic but he's expected back in town sometime tomorrow

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,544
You seem rather busy

24
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,104
Oh yes I mean you've heard

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,248
Mr schewald's corporate Dynasty ever since he came out of seclusion and resumed his financial activities

26
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:30,368
All of his affiliate companies and related businesses throughout Germany have been very active

27
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
The whole Japanese business Community is desperately vying for his attention

28
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,584
Why is he laughing

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,424
So Mr Yamamoto will not be able to meet with you today

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,008
But I can say that I knew Kenzo 10 my just as well as he did

31
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
So feel free to ask anything

32
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
But of course

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
I have to say inspector I'm shocked

34
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,968
He's still under investigation

35
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Well

36
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,552
I'll just say that we haven't come to any conclusions

37
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
I was floored to hear 10 my name does a suspect in your investigation I couldn't have imagined such a thing you just

38
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,304
Said you felt shocked was it really that unexpected absolutely

39
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,864
Kenzo tenmark killer

40
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:24,384
Come on it's just crazy not in a million years what I have paid 10 months of killer

41
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
We had drinks a couple of times

42
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
I guess about 3 years ago

43
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
You really didn't seem like a bad guy

44
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
So he really didn't seem like a bad guy

45
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,184
You're saying you thought he was a good guy then a good guy

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,208
Let's see

47
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,792
I think reserved would be the word I'd used to describe tema

48
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
What you're saying then is that not being open is what makes him a good man

49
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,032
You're being social that's what I meant by not a bad guy

50
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,311
Japanese people don't normally wear these sorts of clothes

51
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
Japanese people are skillful with chopsticks

52
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
So now I will be Japanese

53
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Domo

54
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
I'm Japanese

55
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
I am a Japanese man

56
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,927
I am a Japanese man

57
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
I am 10

58
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Hello

59
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
Yes

60
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Fine

61
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,151
I called because I heard you were in

62
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
I had my baby

63
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
I thought you'd want to know

64
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
I see

65
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
That's good

66
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,535
I know a lot of things have been said between us

67
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
I want you to see your grandchild

68
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Will you see

69
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
Of course I will

70
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
Would tomorrow be okay

71
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Yes

72
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,847
As long as it's after 6:00

73
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Where would you like to meet

74
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
Near Marion plots

75
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Okay

76
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
All right

77
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
See you then

78
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Dom

79
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Hey

80
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
You're pretty good with those Chopsticks you know that

81
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Is that so

82
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:02,239
Sure these days I see a lot of foreigners using Chopsticks better than native Japanese

83
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,799
So Dr Takahashi

84
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,711
As a former colleague of temas what would you say was your impression of him let's see

85
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,807
As I remember he wasn't a hard guy to like

86
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,927
Though he was occasionally more than a bit indecisive still

87
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
Go on

88
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,535
With a scalpel in his hand he was a whole other person

89
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,471
People called him a genius brain surgeon and I can say that was no exaggeration

90
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
What about his parents

91
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
He never really talked about his parents much

92
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,687
But he said his father and older brother were doctors also

93
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,295
So I guess they put them on the physician's path whether he liked it or not

94
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
In fact

95
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,975
I think I remember him saying he hadn't been back to Japan since coming to Germany for medical school

96
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:00,863
Matter of fact his parents didn't come to Germany at all to support him when the Scandal broke

97
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,519
I don't think they made any public appeal for their son's innocence either I guess he and his family weren't all that

98
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
You know what I mean

99
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
Thanks for waiting

100
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,719
Sorry it's taking so long but we've just gotten word from Yamamoto

101
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
He's left Prague and he's back in Munich

102
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,631
But unfortunately he has a client who needs must be tended to immediately

103
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
He seems to be a busy man

104
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,079
If it's any consolation he did say he was going to join all of us at a bar after work a bar

105
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
That's right

106
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,407
Care to join us for a drink inspector

107
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
The fates of delivered you this opportunity

108
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
After all it's always good to make a few new contacts

109
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
No

110
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Tonight I have to I guess he and his family weren't all that tight-knit you

111
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
You know what I mean

112
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
I am

113
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
Sounds great

114
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,199
I would be happy to join you tonight

115
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
Yeah tomorrow well done

116
00:08:54,271 --> 00:09:00,159
Inspector Lungi how about a song yeah

117
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
No this next song is mine let's sing

118
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
All right

119
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:27,039
I am 10ma

120
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
I am 10 I don't fit into Japanese Society

121
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
I do not ask others for help I don't fit in anywhere

122
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
I have no home to return to I am

123
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
Alone

124
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
Domo domo I'm sorry I'm late guys

125
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
There you are Yamamoto

126
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:08,255
Inspector Lungi you know the one I told you about on the phone I'm Yamamoto of the Munich

127
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
Ranch of the kind of fuku

128
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,703
Domo so how did it go with Mr coached in the check Republic

129
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
He's a tough nut

130
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
Oh yeah that thing I was supposed to get

131
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
Done what thing you know that one thing that you vaults right hand man was asking us to get the blonde

132
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Guy that

133
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
That's great news right now kissing up to him is the best way to close a deal with shoe volt so we got to get on that man's

134
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
Good side and stay there

135
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,607
I went poking through all the second hand book stores in Prague and I was finally able to find a copy

136
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
Wow so that's the picture book you wanted unfortunately it's kind of worn out and the cover is coming off a little

137
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Restoration and it'll be beautiful

138
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Excuse me

139
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,735
I think we can use a couple of beers over here hey Google

140
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
It's written in check

141
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:13,279
All right it's my turn again all right that's great

142
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,583
Hope you guys been practicing

143
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,407
So inspector what are you looking up in the dictionary

144
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
Translating check

145
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Check huh

146
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,319
So does it have something to do with that investigation you've got going no

147
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
It's a personal project

148
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:43,999
I'm kind of surprised to see you're doing anything that's not related to your case it's from a picture book

149
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
I like the illustration

150
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,119
I just wanted to know what the passage said

151
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
Inspectors reading a picture book

152
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
That's something you don't see everyday

153
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Look at me

154
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Look at me

155
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
The monster inside me has gotten this

156
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
I see

157
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,927
So Johan is pulling the strings on that billionaire

158
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,047
Dr Gillen you've been telling me all about this Johan person for a while now

159
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,119
You painted him as quite the monster haven't you

160
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Monster

161
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Yeah

162
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
I mean I've killed some people sure

163
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,383
But he's transformed himself into the sort of creature I could only dream of becoming

164
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
This Johann has become my idol

165
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
My hero

166
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Really

167
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:43,135
Well there is one more question that I would like to ask of you if you don't mind knock yourself out if you were

168
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,695
What would be the next move that you made

169
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Well that's

170
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Obvious

171
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,119
The parents you know the lieberts

172
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,935
I think it would be time for them to die

173
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
Mr Liebert

174
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,127
Mr Hebert

175
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
What brought you to that conclusion

176
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Because

177
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:14,623
I've gotten bored

178
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
Yes hello

179
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,863
You're a psychologist I'm sorry we don't understand

180
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,519
What can we do for you Dr reichvine I won't waste your time with a long winded explanation I just want to ask some

181
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
Questions about your adopted son Johan

182
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,127
Johan adopted

183
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
You must be mistaken

184
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,319
That boy is our child I gave birth to him that's enough Mrs Liebert I know for a fact that your real child

185
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Child is buried in brunthal

186
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
There was a fire that burned down the town hall along with all the birth records the fire allowed you to apply for a new birth

187
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
Certificate as if your original child were still alive

188
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
What's this all about

189
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,751
Look I didn't come here to make threats I promise you

190
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,311
All I want to do is help if you let me

191
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
Please read this

192
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
It's a report about Johan

193
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
About Johan

194
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,831
Yes a friend compiled that information

195
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
I've met him

196
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,303
He came to the house selling insurance policies

197
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
That man was former detective Richard Brown

198
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
He's a detective

199
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
He was

200
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
He's dead now

201
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Just read

202
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
The story actually starts a few years ago

203
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
When an East German government official escaped and sought Refuge here in West Germany in 1986

204
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
What's it about is he after money money

205
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,671
No Johan couldn't care less about money

206
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,279
Then why go after a billionaire like shoe hold in the first place

207
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,863
You know that thing you did as a kid what thing

208
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,191
When I was a kid I would find a line of ants

209
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,007
Yeah I'm not playing with them

210
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
Mess with her formation

211
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
My God I refuse to believe this it's all simply Dreadful

212
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
This story is ridiculous look I understand that you don't want to believe it the two

213
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:34,399
You lost your only son at a very early age I know your life moves on and you wait to be blessed with a new child

214
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
Until one day a boy nearly the same age as yours appears and to sweeten the pot the boy arrives with money

215
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
He provides you with the wonderful house to live in in a nice neighborhood with a beautiful garden

216
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
And he provides you with love I understand that both of you

217
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
If you want to believe in him however everything that's written in these documents is true so

218
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:06,399
Who is Johan really I need you to tell me about Johan

219
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
You hun

220
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
A good boy

221
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,615
Yes he's just a very nice boy

222
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,455
And he's very smart a clever boy

223
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
You see

224
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,039
Johann is our reason for being

225
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
And is that all

226
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,743
You've been acting as his parents for years

227
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
And that's all you have to say about him

228
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
It's obvious neither of you knows the first thing about him

229
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,471
I've come here because I need your help

230
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,055
My friend Richard has already died at his hands

231
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Right now

232
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
As we speak a man named Tenma is

233
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,479
He's moving towards something drastic that can't be undone

234
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
Please you have to help me

235
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
No

236
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
More importantly

237
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
You'll end up

238
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,023
Like all the other couples mentioned in this report

239
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,863
They were all previous foster parents of johann's just like you

240
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
Murdered every one of them

241
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
You have to leave now

242
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
If you stay you'll die

243
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:41,887
Oh the apple tree

244
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,287
Such small fruit but I think next year's apples will be much healthier

245
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:54,431
That will be delightful yes so very delightful

246
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,759
He's going to be killed by a Japanese guy soon

247
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
Is that what Johann is telling those kids

248
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
Correct what do you think

249
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
What's it mean

250
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,023
Well he's not thinking about suicide that's for sure

251
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
Okay

252
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
But what does it mean

253
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,935
Man who really knows what goes on in a brilliant mind like that

254
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
Although

255
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
I can at least say this much

256
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,871
If nuclear war broke out in the world burned to Ash

257
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
He'd still be standing

258
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,559
He's basically telling us that there's nothing we can do

259
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,679
And he's right everything we've done so far is let us absolutely nowhere

260
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,007
My God we weren't even able to save poor Richard

261
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,639
Look we can't just throw in the towel but we still haven't been able to track down Dr Tenma

262
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
Face it we couldn't stop him from trying to kill Yohan even if we wanted to it's been in vain Dr

263
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,623
Find please we need to try and remain calm here

264
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
Yeah you're right

265
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,887
He talked about breaking up the line of ants

266
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
Even ant

267
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
Possessed soul

268
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:31,455
Doctor where are you going at this point we've got nothing to lose

269
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
Do we it's time to tell the old man our story

270
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:44,255
I'm going to have a little talk with shuvault what

271
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,655
Additional 50 chairs so many people this list just keeps growing and growing you mean all of this is

272
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:57,055
Just for Mr schewald's book donation ceremony yeah a lot of VIPs have been added it's turning into a pretty big

273
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
Thing I guess everything shootout does is bound to turn into an event

274
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:16,255
The library will be closing shortly again the library

275
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,415
Excuse me

276
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
I'm sorry

277
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,303
Could you get that book down for me

278
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,655
That check dictionary up on the top I can't reach it

279
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
Oh okay

280
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
Is this

281
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Yes

282
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
I'm sorry

283
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
Thanks a lot

284
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,199
Actually I'm borrowing a check picture book

285
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
I'm trying to translate it

286
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
I see

287
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
Would you believe it

288
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,672
My friend collapsed right here out of nowhere while looking at this book

289
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
I thought that

290
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,048
Maybe there was something in the book that could have triggered that response

291
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
So your friend

292
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
He's all right now he's fine

293
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
Thanks again

294
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Sure

295
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:47,648
Once upon a time in a land far away

296
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:54,048
They're left a nameless monster

297
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:02,240
He was dying to have a name so the monster

298
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:08,640
So the monster made up his mind to set out on a journey to look for one

299
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
We're close enough hun

300
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,136
I will be closed tomorrow for the ceremony
