3

7
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,904
Hey kid where the hell are you going

8
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
Come on give me a break

9
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,328
Leaving that rug in this town is a complete waste that guy doesn't know what it's worth

10
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,936
How many times do I got to tell you stop looking at me like that

11
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
Slime ball

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,616
Yes see if I care don't come crying to me when you're starving and I'm living like a king

13
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,712
And if you tell anybody about this you're going to pay for you got that

14
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,320
Who would want to be friends with a dirty Thief like him anyway

15
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,904
I don't need him

16
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,096
I'm so hungry right now

17
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,936
There there don't cry I'd be good boy

18
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
Mommy's coming back soon I promise what's wrong doesn't he have a mom of course he does

19
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,200
What about you what are you doing sitting here alone you should go home to your mom

20
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
Wait a sec you don't have a mom to go home too

21
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,464
Hey I'm sorry if what I said hurt your feelings kid

22
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
It's all right

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
I've got 10

24
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,544
Eat as much as you want it's nothing special but don't feel like you got to hold back

25
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,944
So you were just sitting on the steps waiting for that tender guy to come back and get you huh

26
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
That little guy is waiting too

27
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
Where's his mom why did she leave where'd she go

28
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,184
A bunch of bad guys came and took her away

29
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
We got a saver

30
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
It's just so dangerous out there

31
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:50,400
An Asian man I met said he was going to try and help her but then he got hit by a car right in front of me

32
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
An Asian man

33
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
Wait you said 10 Mile was Japanese didn't you

34
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,592
But there's no way it could be the same person could

35
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
Where are they I've got to help them

36
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,000
On the phone

37
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,095
I have to say that I'm going to burn the entire town tomorrow

38
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
Please you must help me

39
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
My baby

40
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,383
I don't want my baby to die

41
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,687
How crazy was telling me

42
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Who is it

43
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
Professor guidlitz has asked me to bring you some fruit

44
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
Thank you very much

45
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
The professor also asked me to deliver a message

46
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,887
General wolf will be here shortly and would like to meet with you

47
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,983
You mean the man in the photograph with my brother

48
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
That's right

49
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,591
General wolf is the person who knows Johan better than anyone

50
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,919
Probably even more than you do even though you're his twin sister

51
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
That's what Professor Gillett said

52
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
No don't go dying on me just yet

53
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
General volts going to be here in a minute

54
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,327
And I want him to see what a wonderful job I've done of capturing you alive

55
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
Well if you say

56
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,495
That's General to you do you understand

57
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,895
You should search out a general wolf he's the one who first discovered joh

58
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,711
Disabilities

59
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,599
Receiving praise from General wolf is an absolute dream come true for anyone

60
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
Excuse me sir

61
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,743
We've assembled our members in the arson teams ready to set fire to the Turkish quarter

62
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
Shall we continue with the plan is scheduled

63
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
Yes proceed with the itinerary

64
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,191
I'm looking forward to dinner with a view of a beautiful creams in the sky

65
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,799
Be sure everything stays on schedule otherwise my perfect dinner will be ruined

66
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:10,431
And tell them that if anything goes wrong forgiveness will come at a very high price yes sir

67
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
He won't do it

68
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
Joan isn't going to lead you

69
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:20,159
You'll never be able to convince Johann to lead your organization are you out of your mind

70
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:28,863
Doesn't share your simple-minded views on racial Purity he's not just an ignorant bigot like all of you

71
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,471
He's different don't you see he looks down on all Humanity

72
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Silence

73
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,319
Well well what do we have here

74
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,415
Hey get this gentleman a drink on me I'm thinking the usual

75
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695

Damn well

77
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,855
Not bad for a little guy that kid's going to be serious trouble when he grows up

78
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
That was disgusting

79
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
How can they drink that stuff

80
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
This is 10 ms jacket

81
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943

82
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
Everything will be all right

83
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511

00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
I want to help you get out of here but

85
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
I can't really do anything right now

86
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
I'm going to sneak out of here

87
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
And I want everybody in your neighborhood

88
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,847

93
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391

94
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Hang in there

95
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
I forgot to ask your name

96
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Nina

97
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,655
And when this is over I hope we get to know each other better

98
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,055
I've had so many bad things happen to me since I came to Germany

99
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,575
I forgot to ask you what's your baby's name

100
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
Hey I say

101
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
Are you there

102
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
What's happening

103
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:15,007
Leave her alone

104
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,295
Tell me is the man sitting in that chair Dr temma

105
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
And I captured him with my very own hands

106
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
So where is General wolf

107
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
General wolf is waiting

108
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
Will be taking the doctor to

109
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,167
No wait what do you mean but I wanted to show General both my prize catch and then finish him off myself

110
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
So what do you want me to do with this kid

111
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,383
I found them walking around downstairs looking for Tenma it's a friend of yours

112
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
No of course not

113
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,271
Metro has nothing to do with this just let him go

114
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,903
You don't really expect me to take a filthy Street agent like this to General wolf do you

115
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
Dispose of him you heard me finish him off go ahead of

Already he bothers me yes sir

117
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,695

Apologies doctor please forgive us for the rude treatment you've received

120
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,591
It's very important to General wolf that you be treated as his guest

121
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Poor I say

122
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Please

123
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
Help me

124
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,799
I have to warn the other so my baby will die too

125
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
We are

126
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Friends

127
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
Isn't that

128
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
Yes we are I say

129
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
We are friends

130
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,631
What happened here

131
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
Professor Keith let's

132
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
Everybody's dead

133
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
We should be arriving at General Volks Mansion momentarily after 10 month

134
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
Tell me is Nina going to be there yes you can rest assured she is all so considered to be a special

135
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,791
List of General wolf what about the Turkish lady the baby's mom I don't know we don't know anything at all

136
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
We simply follow orders and nothing else

137
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
Burn Tonight We got to go back we have to let them know where the lady who gave me dinner last night and the baby are going to die

138
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:12,991
They're all going to die be that as it may young man I can't let you go we must take

139
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,367
Thank you to General Volks mansion

140
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
Think you can make it to the Turkish quarter on your own I'll be there soon but right now it's important that I go with these men

141
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
But

142
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
You can do it I know you can if you go right now you'll be able to save everyone on Calvin Street go on hurry

143
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
From here you should be able to get to the city in 30 minutes

144
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:50,111
I apologize but I had to do that I had no choice

145
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:56,511
Now I know you trusted me enough to give me back my gun and I may have just broken that trust but it didn't seem like you

146
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,911
You were going to stop otherwise it's fine I'm sure General wolf will be pleased to know that you don't just

147
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:08,799
Area gun around for sure and that you're not afraid to use it when needed

148
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
If you would please follow me

149
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,575
Where's Nina I want to see her she is here isn't she

150
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,231
Patience before we do anything else we must see General wolf and Professor gilitz I just need to know for myself

151
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
But she's safe

152
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,327
Professor gate lets his dad

153
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
And it's not just gilets all of his men have

154
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Call soap and kill

155
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,847
We've disposed of the bodies

156
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Everything's been taken care of

157
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,551
What about Nina when we first arrived with General Volk we search the entire Mansion she was nowhere to be

158
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Found

159
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,391
Your doctor tenmark corre

160
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
Wait do I know you

161
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:09,215
You wouldn't recognize me even if you saw my face

162
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:16,895
I don't recognize me but people call me for both

163
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:23,295
That means that you you don't look anything like the picture from 10 years ago

164
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:29,695
That's because

165
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Fear has AG

166
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:37,631
Sir please hurry can't you go any faster you crazy

167
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:44,031
I'm pushing 200 here no reason

168
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
Make it in time

169
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
I think people's names are very interest

170
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
Mysterious

171
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,783
All the places I've been throughout my

172
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,599
Everybody has referred to me

173
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
On the other hand

174
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,327
Every time I encounter someone new I must tell them that my name is

175
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
I wonder

176
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
How can they really know that it's me

177
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,495
What's there to prove that I really am

178
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,847
You're the one who found Johan and his sister isn't that right

179
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
I did

180
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,175
It's happened 12 years ago

181
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,063
And that's when he was sent to 511 kinderheim they were going to tournament to a super soldier weren't they

182
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
But you had bigger plans for him

183
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
That's correct

184
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
He was supposed to become

185
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,023
Our country safer before it's down

186
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,423
And now you're trying to make sure it becomes the next Adolf Hitler so that he can lead the ultranationalist isn't that your plan

187
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:54,687
At the moment I'm only part of this organization because it benefits me

188
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,759
I did hear that the others are trying to make

189
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
I'm into another

190
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
I think it's a stupid idea

191
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Imagine

192
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:11,327
If a man like Hitler was able to take things as far as he did Johan could do more

193
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
Yes

194
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,727
I was the one who gave him the name joh

195
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,359
We found the twins wondering near the check border

196
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,735
They had managed to evade the heavy security patrol somehow

197
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
They were dead on their feet

198
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,671
Malnourished to almost frozen to death

199
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,023
When we finally arrived the two of them simply coll

200
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,839
They both would have perished

201
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,143
If we hadn't found them when we

202
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,751
I too know what it's like to have saved johans

203
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,455
When he became Consciousness I asked him a simple question

204
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527
How do you feel

205
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
And do you know what his reply was

206
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
He said

207
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
You will know very soon

208
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
I know there's no more proof I really

209
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,007
All the people who knew me have disappeared my wife

210
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:27,359
Children siblings relatives friends

211
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
Everybody from my life

212
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:37,087
Get all of them died one by one I have you'll have to thank for that

213
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,535
The money I brought with me back for me is Germany is the only proof I

214
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,839
Good morning name is Wolf

215
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
Because of your heart I am a stranger to all you will

216
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
Oh very soon

217
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,103
No I understand what he

218
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
Lonely

219
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,039
Take a look at this doctor

220
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,207
Come to the abandoned warehouse of hilden and Engels company in romb

221
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,767
Johann was here this morning

222
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,423
He came here to slaughter he let's send his men yet another

223
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,751
The person who knew me has been murdered

224
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,919
I imagine Nina must have seen this and gone there to

225
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Please kill him

226
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
Back of you

227
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,439
Calm down kid what are you talking about

228
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,863
Calvin street is going to burn tonight we have to hurry and tell everyone I can't believe this

229
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,495
This is amazing it must be my lucky day this is great now I can grab that rug during the fire

230
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
What it's score

231
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,847
How can you think that way

232
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:08,735
Keep it down you little brat if you tell him you want about this I swear out hey let me go

233
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:15,135
Listen kid I'm not just talking about all those Turks okay if any of the right Wingers find out what we know

234
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,512
Dead what you didn't notice all the guys with the freaking SWAT the good tattoos around here

235
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312
One more question

236
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,920
Was a Turkish woman being held hostage in there we found a dead woman on the third floor

237
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,992
Based on what we saw I don't think Johan killed her

238
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
Look like it was the work of Professor gilitzman

239
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:50,720
Well General wolf do you really think you'll be able to kill Johan

240
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
I don't know

241
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
However he still has time me maybe able to

242
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:24,256
What is this supposed to mean
