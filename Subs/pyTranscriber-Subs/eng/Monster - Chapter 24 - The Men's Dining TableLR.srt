1
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:26,368
I saw you on

2
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
Disown have to kill you

3
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,760
Yes I've seen something that I wasn't supposed to see

4
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,624
I'm thinking it was that sweet looking blonde boy I saw in Dusseldorf a year ago

5
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,952
Because I've seen Johann this is how it ends up

6
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
That's how it works with you

7
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,144
It was dark and raining when I heard those three gunshots

8
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
I was there alone and got scared so I ran away

9
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,056
At the time I was pretty certain it was tedma who'd been shot dead

10
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
But the next day there was this big article in the newspaper saying that a man named Yonkers had been found dead in the same location

11
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
And that he'd been shot three times

12
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
So then that boy did it didn't he

13
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
Might want to rethink holding that trigger

14
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
If you kill me you'll never forget what you really want

15
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,680
That photograph you've been looking for the one of Johann as a young boy

16
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,032
Let me tell you what will happen if you do decide to kill me

17
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,408
If I die I've arranged for that photo you want so much to be delivered directly to the bka

18
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,528
If you want to see that photograph you need to tell me exactly where tenema can be found

19
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
Just what is so funny your whole body is quivering you

20
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,872
Talk tough but your legs are shaking so hard you can barely stand

21
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:06,272
You really do amuse me

22
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:12,672
Tell you where he is so what is now oh he's still working as a doctor

23
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,256
But our friend is going on the ground

24
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
How's this older guy in Hanover who was the number two men in a certain organized crime family well

25
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
You guys boss kind of freaked out and put out a hit on him but the job got botched the guy got all shut up

26
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
But he didn't die so Tim was at this remote Alpine estate patching him up it's up on a

27
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,527
Near foosen

28
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
Excuse me but why did you just stand there like that

29
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,207
Hey mister it's almost time for lunch

30
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,727
Why in the world are we eating outside

31
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
I just thought

32
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
The weather looks so nice this afternoon

33
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,895
Why not mix up our routine and eat outside

34
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,199
Why have our lunch out here

35
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
Dieter

36
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
Go ahead and bring the plates out here

37
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Okay

38
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
Oh your wounds are healing nicely

39
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
And this fresh air will do you good

40
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
I have to say doctor

41
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,095
If you hadn't been there I doubt I would have made it

42
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:01,471
That country Clinic was pathetic but the masterful skills you possess allowed you to save my life

43
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,847
Maybe the one bullet just grazed your head and the other one went into your leg and passed through cleanly

44
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
Just be thankful it didn't catch your femoral art

45
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
To be honest you are quite lucky

46
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Lucky huh

47
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,879
Alrighty guys lunches

48
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
Wow that smells good heckle

49
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
Surprising isn't it it tastes Del

50
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
Delicious Heckle may look more like a pickpocket but he's actually quite the chef don't you agree and what in the hell did you mean

51
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
Mean by that

52
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,151
This my friends is chicken Marengo the key to the dish is the sauce you have to get it just right

53
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
It's based on a recipe from a three-star French restaurant called La Petite

54
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,951
Look like you just can't appreciate the subtleties of fine cuisine you know this would take Stephen better with a dash of soy sauce

55
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
Soy sauce not that again you put soy sauce on everything thank you this is dining

56
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,191
When you sit down to eat this is how it should be

57
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
What a Wast

58
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,103
All my life everything I did was to make money

59
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,455
But while I was earning all those Millions I lost things much more valuable

60
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
Both of my parents

61
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,855
And my only brother disowned me even my wife and son were murdered

62
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,671
I always wanted to leave peacefully

63
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
Dying like we're doing right now

64
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
Money can really change the way people

65
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,615
Allow me to share a good example with you

66
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:54,367
5 years ago a covert banking organization was formed to facilitate the underground funds flowing throughout Germany

67
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
But these guys pulled off was absolutely amazing

68
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,583
Within days of the Dirty Money flowing in through Shady companies it would come out the other side perfectly clean

69
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,911
A money laundering operation exactly

70
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,263
On top of that this organization functioned in many ways like a real Bank

71
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,847
Making loans and investing in speculative transactions

72
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,455
And a girl unbelievably fast in five short years they made a fortune

73
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
Hot damn

74
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:27,135
But that all changed this year because the man who'd been running the show suddenly vanished he hasn't been seen in months and

75
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
Windows where he

76
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
Guess what happened then

77
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
All of it fell apart

78
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
The entire operation

79
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Uploaded

80
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:42,751
The associates that remains started fighting over who would get what was left and who would be in charge

81
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,103
Most of them ended up killing each other

82
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,407
The entire operation disappeared

83
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:54,783
If only they've been sensible and talk things out while sharing a fine dinner

84
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,975
You think that guy got murdered or did he just run off

85
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,583
Keep up doc I mean the head honcho guy who disappeared

86
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,143
So kidnapped murdered what do you think

87
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Oh no

88
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
I'm quite sure he's still alive

89
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
In fact he might even be posing as a student somewhere

90
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
A student

91
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
That's right I forgot to tell you

92
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
I left out something important

93
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,647
According to my sources the guy who created that money laundering organization 5 years ago was just a kid

94
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
15 years old

95
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:44,959
15 years old you sources must be nuts no way it could pull off something like

96
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
Like that but it's true this kid did it

97
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,127
Senses if he was conducting his own experiment to see how adults deal with money

98
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
As though he were a child

99
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,735
Playing around with a line of ants

100
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
Where was all this

101
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
Do you know where this covert banking operation was based

102
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:08,511
The organization was headquartered in Dusseldorf but the kid at the top was constantly on the move

103
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,351
He controlled the entire operation from wherever he was you know

104
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,471
And did anybody figure out the last place that he was seen before he disappeared

105
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:24,383
I saw the details I know but I heard right after their young boss went missing all of his money hungry underlings went Rush

106
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Into mun

107
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
Communicate

108
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
Hey Doc why the long face huh what's going on

109
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
I know

110
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,671
Let's invite that man down the hell up here for lunch sure why not

111
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
That's a good idea

112
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,559
Sorry doctor but that means my body God he needs to stay down there

113
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,143
But haven't you been officially declared dead already

114
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,471
You still think there are people out there who want to do you harm

115
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:54,335
Are you planning to live the rest of your life and fear hiding behind a bodyguard

116
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,207
How much has been with me for a very long time indeed

117
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
Go ahead son

118
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,887
Go and get helmet so that's his name he wouldn't be at all I bet

119
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
Go and tell him that his duties is My Bodyguard her over

120
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
Is the only one left is like family to me

121
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Ask him to join us

122
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,479
Have him come here so we can discuss our future at this table

123
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,223
Mr Helmut lunch time they want you to come up and join us

124
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:10,111
Time is right up there in the mountain Villa

125
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,231
You do want to kill him don't you

126
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:32,127
Something to matter that was a security breach signal from helmet

127
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:38,271
Unfortunately I think he's already dead

128
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,087
Wait someone's coming after you

129
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,487
There's no telling but I'd say someone's heading up here even as we speak

130
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,887
Mr helmet song

131
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
Go tell him

132
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
You have to tell him to run away

133
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,807
Hurry go until 10 minutes now

134
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Tell him damn it

135
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
I said go tell him

136
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
But your leg you've been shot don't worry about me go

137
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
Hang on

138
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Who's shooting at us

139
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Did you get him

140
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
I'm not sure

141
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
But now's your chance to run for it get going

142
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:18,623
But I can't go you're out here in the open I can help you I can handle this just

143
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,951
No no you can't I'm going home quick

144
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
Well well

145
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
Looks like I was wrong

146
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
She didn't want to kill him after all

147
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
You going to be all right man

148
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
I'll be fine

149
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
But I think

150
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,407
He's already heading up the hill on his way to the villa

151
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:46,783
Not a chance I would have seen him from here there's really only one path to get all the way up to that house

152
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
What are you talking about

153
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,207
I've explored this whole mountain and this path is the only way up there all the other pass lead to Cliffs no one can climb

154
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,351
So then if we guard this Trail there's no other way Roberto will be able to get far enough of the mountain to get to the villa

155
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
You mean you know this guy

156
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
I know him too well

157
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,007
Roberto's after 10 money he wants to kill him

158
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,847
You know Tenma so who are you ma'am are you a friend of his

159
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,623
What you laughing about ma'am don't make me sound so old stop calling me man

160
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,695
Now get out of here kid you get up there until 10

161
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
Tell him to run away quick

162
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,559
But but man I mean lady you're bleeding

163
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
I'll be all right

164
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,423
You just get up there and warn him but your leg looks like it's bleeding a lot

165
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,031
10 my mustard those gunshots I bet he's headed down here to take care of that guy

166
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
It's not good

167
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,407
Roberta wants 10 minutes come down here and try to save us so we can kill him

168
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
Don't you see it's a trap and where the bait to bring him here

169
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:55,647
But what can we do man if we try to make a run for it with your leg you might bleed to death stop calling me ma'am what did I

170
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Tell you

171
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,583
So just what are you to tend anyway I miss friend

172
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
What about you

173
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887

Aren't you a friend of tennis too you must because even though you're hurt really bad you're still trying to save him

175
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,175

00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967

00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,535
Yeah I like him a whole lot what exactly do you like about him

180
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
Lots of things

181
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
What do you like about

I know you're there crawl around all you want for you

183
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
Pretty stupid to shoot me again I already told you if I die that picture of Johann is a child that

184
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,391
You want so badly will automatically be sent straight to the bka I mean it this is your last warning if

185
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
So that photo you've got is something you really want it's a lie and it might not

186
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
Don't work he's too smart to fall for such a trick lady are you feeling all right

187
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,175
Need to fade I've lost a lot of blood

188
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,807
Now go we'll get out of here save yourself

189
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:34,207
I can't just leave you 10 minutes on his way he would have been here by now he's got to be headed here

190
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,303
I mean it look there's no way he would ever come to save me

191
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
Nothing but a waste of time

192
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
Peter where are you

193
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687

194
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
I'm coming to get you Peter

195
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
Don't move

196
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,135
If you try to come get us there's a man here that's going to shoot you

197
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
That's why he's come here 10

198
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
To kill you

199
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
I know that voice but it can't be

200
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:15,935
10 months this lady is a friend of yours she's been shot and she's bleeding a lot

201
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
You can't die no not what I'm so close I'm handing you over to the police

202
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,903
I want every waking moment to hurt for dumping me stop shouting you're straining yourself

203
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
Hey Jesus just tell

204
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,655
Tell me if you can hear me okay can you tell where the shooter is

205
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
No I don't know

206
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,823
I've got no clue where he is or even if he still here

207
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,223
Stop yelling to him I need 10 more alive

208
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,831
Hang in there he's getting close

209
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,391
He's not coming to hear you're wrong

210
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,207
He would never come to my rescue

211
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:19,679
It's all over for me don't die please

212
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:26,079
Why would she ever

213
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
Rescue Me

214
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,407
What's all this why did you bring me out here

215
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
It's time for lunch

216
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,271
Your leg has been healing up nicely

217
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,367
And I thought you'd enjoy eating lunch outside in this beautiful sunshine

218
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,927
You're a lucky woman you know

219
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,207
What do you mean

220
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Just

221
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,839
A guy who shot you was a real Pro you know what he was doing

222
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,191
He understood how difficult it would be for him to infiltrate this mountain Villa

223
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
There's only one path to get up here

224
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
And there are security cameras everywhere

225
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,759
He also knew this Villa would be guided by experienced men so it would be like he was attacking an Alpine Fortress

226
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
That was the reason he used you

227
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,623
Hold on what do you mean he used me

228
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
It's simple

229
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:50,559
He must have figured that a pretty woman making an unexpected visit would have a much better chance of getting all the way up here than he

230
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,887
But when you betrayed him his old plan was sunk

231
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
He had no plan B there were no other options for him

232
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,775
So he got out of here quick and cut his losses

233
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
So then he got away

234
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
That's right

235
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
We search the whole Mountain

236
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
This is a special dish

237
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,271
It's called chicken Marengo

238
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,879
I tried to recreate the recipe but I can't guarantee it'll be any good

239
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,976
You know there's another way you were very lucky

240
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,584
You were lucky to have a great doctor like Dr tender treating you

241
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
So is Tim still here

242
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
He already left

243
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,360
Where to thank you said something about going to mun

244
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
Munich a

245
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
All right

246
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,928
Let's see if you and I can enjoy this chicken I got a feeling you're like me and I

247
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:53,024
Long time since you sat down and enjoyed a meal in peace
