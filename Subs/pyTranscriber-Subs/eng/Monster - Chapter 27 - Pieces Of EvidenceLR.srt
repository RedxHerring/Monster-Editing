1
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,144
You're looking very well

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,752
And how's your job everything going smoothly

3
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,336
I'm happy you're doing well

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,920
Is Rosemary all right

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
How she adjusting

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,480
She's doing fine

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,296
She's made a lot of new friends

8
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,832
That's terrific

9
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624
Sounds like she's fitting in

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,696
Yeah that's really good news

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,048
She's becoming used to her new school

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,584
It's getting to be quite late

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,376
But right now before I forget

14
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,704
I brought you some pictures their new ones of Rosemary

15
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,312
I prefer to see her in person

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,944
How about 2 days from now we could meet here again

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:01,440
Fact is I'm completely sober my life's back to normal again

18
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
Well

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,304
Actually this may be the first time my life's been truly normal

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,144
It's finally clear to me how much I've screwed up

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,288
I'm going to let her decide whether she wants to see you or not

22
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
Yeah

23
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,360
I'm really hoping she will

24
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
Richard I have to go now or I'll be late

25
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
Sia

26
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,416
Yes sir

27
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
Just more coffee please

28
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
Dr rifine

29
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
What's your impression of this man

30
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,768
Tell me something Richard

31
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
Precisely why do you think you're here

32
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Well

33
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,704
You're here for counseling I asked a questions remember

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,544
And as I've told you before I'm a doctor not a fortune teller

35
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,384
Right you're inside comes from your years of experience with patience

36
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
So who's the boy in the photo this time

37
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,016
A person of interest in my case

38
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,624
He made the initial discovery of Edmond Farms body at the alleged suicide scene

39
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,000
Supposedly he's a friend of the deceased that's all I know well here's what I know Richard yeah

40
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
You're a dedicated workahol

41
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
But you've got to learn to take time for yourself to relax I'm beginning to do just that we'll wonders never

42
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
Cheese and doctor I have news

43
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
About what

44
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
Rosemary

45
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,663
I might be able to see her very soon

46
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
Well you must be looking forward to that

47
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,015
Yeah but just remember

48
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,415
If you do get to see her you can't get back the time you've lost you need to be emotionally prepared for

49
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Changes in her

50
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
No matter what and listen you must not touch a drop of alcohol am I clear don't worry I

51
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,935
I won't I suppose you're off to work on your case again

52
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,727
Don't leave yet

53
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
I think it's time to talk about the event that got you kicked off the police force tell me Richard what do you remember from that day

54
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
Well I remember all of it

55
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
He was 16 years old

56
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
And a suspected murderer

57
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
I've been drinking on the job when I spotted him

58
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
My shot I'm dead

59
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,719
He died because I was drunk

60
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
You faced up to it

61
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,327
But that doesn't erase it it will always be there

62
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
And nothing can remove that memory from your head

63
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,751
So do you know what's important now giving myself permission to move on

64
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
That's correct

65
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,919
You may step to the Head of the Class do I get an A+ Professor not so fast

66
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
I don't give out perfect scores easily I demand results and besides I'm not all that crazy about perfect patience

67
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
They're boring frankly

68
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Neumann

69
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
A business admin student in the economics department at Munich University apparently he told that prostitute

70
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,815
Opposing is Margo Langer that he too is shoe volts real son

71
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,655
At this point I don't know whether he was telling the truth or not

72
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,239
However I need to investigate that possibility

73
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,919
Yes excuse me I finished all the cleaning so I'll be going now

74
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Yeah

75
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
Thanks for all your hard work

76
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
Cleaning for you is never hard work

77
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,111
It's pretty rare for a man living by himself to be so neat

78
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
It makes my job here extremely Pleasant

79
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,511
Well lately I've been trying to clean up my act on all fronts

80
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
I couldn't help but notice

81
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,119
You've got a new picture of your daughter

82
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Yes

83
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,191
I may be able to see her soon

84
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,847
Really that's just wonderful your daughter will be so delighted do you really think so of

85
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
What young girl wouldn't be happy to see her father

86
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,903
Yeah it was a tough one

87
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,975
So were you able to turn your paper in on time

88
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,351
Carl Norman I can't figure you out

89
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,447
If you know for sure then why haven't you told shuvall that you're his son

90
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,823
Are you just another con man or are you the real deal

91
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
If you're legit

92
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
What is stopping you

93
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,807
Don't you realize that any parent would be overjoyed just to see their own child

94
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
I'm so sorry

95
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,647
She said she doesn't want to see you

96
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
Oh well

97
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
That's fine

98
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
She's made up her mind I didn't want to force her it's her decision hey that's okay

99
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
Don't worry about it

100
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
It's

101
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
I've got to go

102
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Yeah

103
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Fine

104
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,991
Yes

105
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
What can I get for you sir

106
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:48,191
Here you go

107
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,927
Then I'll just go where he is and you can find us there no you can't oh Carl

108
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
When you're all grown up you can meet your father if you want don't hate him if he turns you away promise me

109
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
That no matter what because Mommy doesn't hate him keep

110
00:11:53,983 --> 00:12:00,127
This with you always it was a gift from your father on the day you were born

111
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:11,647
With none to admire them

112
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,719
The daffodils of Loris proudly bloom

113
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
With none to mind them

114
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
The Trees of Peoria Russell

115
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
The bloody tracks of the nameless man

116
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
That was wonderful

117
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:32,127
I must say Norman you come a long way and become an excellent reader

118
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
Thanks very much sir

119
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
I'm impressed by how much your Latin has improved in the short time you've been reading for me to be perfectly honest

120
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
I'm being tutored by someone

121
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
Well he certainly is an excellent teacher

122
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
Would he be anybody I know

123
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
Johan

124
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
Johan Liebert is my tutor

125
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
Yoh

126
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
A proficient young man

127
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Yes

128
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
And not only in Latin

129
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
He has an extensive knowledge of Law and economics and amazing aptitude in fact for whatever

130
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Studies

131
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,063
He's a boy who's beautifully gifted at everything he's True Perfection

132
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Mr shoe

133
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,023
What would you think if a boy like him

134
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,119
What if Yohan Liebert was actually your real son

135
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
Then he smiled

136
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
It was the first time I'd ever seen him smile

137
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
He made it clear

138
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
That you're worthy enough

139
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
To be his son Johan

140
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
To be honest I was jealous

141
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,071
No matter which way I looked at it you came off better than me

142
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
I'm ashamed to admit it but I do envy you

143
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
Why don't you just tell him

144
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,407
Come on Carl what have you got to lose go ahead and tell you his real son will you stop it

145
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,991
How many times must I tell you I have no intention of doing that

146
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
What would be the point if I did

147
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
He would never believe me

148
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
And worse than that

149
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,463
Then he'll think of me as just another greedy Predator only interested in getting hold of his fortune

150
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
He'll despise me forever

151
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,839
How my mother lived her life until her death

152
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,655
And with everything I've gone through up till now

153
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
He knows nothing about me

154
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,543
And I won't stand for him thinking I'm after his fortune when he doesn't know a thing

155
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,687
That's exactly why you should go talk to him

156
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,807
You have to gain his trust make him understand the truth about his son

157
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
He'll never believe that I miss son

158
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,695
Well don't you have something from your past that would prove it to him

159
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,559
Anything he might recognize or remember

160
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
You know something you both could recall

161
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
No there's nothing

162
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Far as I know

163
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Think back

164
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,287
There must be something

165
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,151
I'm drawing a big blank it doesn't matter I don't want to tell him okay

166
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,039
If that's the case can you explain why you spend all that time having me tutor you in Latin

167
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
Wasn't it because you wanted to please him

168
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
Because you wanted to make him proud of you

169
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
I'm thinking that maybe

170
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,399
I should quit my job being his reader

171
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Yeah

172
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
It's for the best

173
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
Thanks for all your concern I appreciate it

174
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
But I guess I'm done

175
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
Johan

176
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,343
I feel you're entitled to know

177
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
The truth

178
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
I do have something that

179
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Can prove who I am

180
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Well what is it

181
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,911
It's dumb I don't know why I'm still holding on to it I'm not going to convince him and I don't need to

182
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,495
My foster parents are coming to visit me next week

183
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
I've been fooling myself

184
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
I'm not the son he'd want to have

185
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
So I see

186
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,063
When your mind's made up it's important not to waver so for the time being Carl I think it would be a good idea

187
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:29,183
Idea to let me keep an eye on your proof

188
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
We're so happy to hear your studies are going well

189
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
Isn't that right mother

190
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,703
But I've been worried about you Kyle I want to make sure you're eating right I'm always eating out so I know I have to

191
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,103
Have to be careful not to gain any weight better stay away from your mother's cooking too but it's so delicious

192
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
How's your social life son

193
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
Are you making a lot of new friends here

194
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,783
I've got some people I hang out with and can talk to you about anything

195
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Terrific

196
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,439
It's always good to have friends yes that's very true and it looks to us like you're doing quite well

197
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
I'm extremely grateful to both of you

198
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
That I can even be here

199
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,375
Whoa what's this all of a sudden there's no need for thanks

200
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,727
For years I was shuttled from one foster home to another where no one cared about me

201
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:19,103
But you two have treated me with such kindness that's because you're a wonderful young man we both think so

202
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
That's right girl

203
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,223
Thank you for everything you've given me Mr and Mrs Lindner

204
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,623
Isn't it about time you stop calling us Mr and Mrs

205
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,743
We came here hoping that you would finally accept our offer

206
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
We know this is been hard for you

207
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
But now

208
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,935
With college treating you so well mother and I were wondering if you'd made up your mind

209
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
Have you decided to become our adopted son Carl

210
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,103
We believe in you and we want you to succeed

211
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
We trust you

212
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,711
Trust us don't you oh absolutely

213
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,783
We understand why you might still be a little hesitant

214
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,599
There's a chance your real parents are still alive

215
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,159
No matter how much effort we make

216
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,767
We can never be your birth parents but maybe there's no maybe about it

217
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Because the both of you

218
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
Or is real to me as my birth parents could ever be

219
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
Oh my

220
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,175
Let's have a toast

221
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,503
Feel like some expensive champagne son yeah

222
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,367
Waiter bring us to Champagne list we're celebrating today's a special day

223
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Hello

224
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Carl speaking

225
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Hello Carl it's me

226
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
Do you know who this is

227
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,687
Mr schuvalt

228
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
Now what's this I hear about

229
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
You quitting your job

230
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Right

231
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
That's very disappointing

232
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
I'm sorry for any inconvenience this might cause

233
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,255
I just hate to see you abandon your lat

234
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
You put so much hard

235
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
Thank you for your concern sir

236
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
It really is a shame

237
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,495
I'm going to miss you you know

238
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,079
As a favor to me

239
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
If you don't mind

240
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Would you read to me

241
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
One last time

242
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Sure

243
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
It'll be my pleasure

244
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
How about the third chapter of

245
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
From EOS to lemnos

246
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
A splendid choice

247
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
That mysterious sea

248
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,815
Beckons for the death of even the god Phoebus

249
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
What other pleasure could there be

250
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Than to wish death

251
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,239
Upon the Sons and Daughters of Cerberus

252
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Now

253
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,335
Move forward softly whisper Zeus

254
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
Move forward move on

255
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,223
And dance in the temple that belongs to the dark gods

256
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,575
The gods of Juno who dwell in the sea

257
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
The Earth

258
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
And the heavens

259
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,559
From the summit of the Parthenon steal the forbidden apple of Campania

260
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
And bring forth

261
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,887
The apple and everything

262
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
Everything to save my soul

263
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
Bring

264
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:33,407
Everything to see my soul

265
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:07,199

00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599

267
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
The best I've heard in my whole life

00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
Why did you keep this from me is is that mine

269
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:29,472
This rabbit's foot holds so many memories I gave it to Margo a long time ago

270
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,080
A good luck charm I wanted to pass that luck to you

271
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,896
This is yours Carl

272
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688

277
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
He told me about everything his help was invaluable so from now on

278
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
You'll be working for me as my secretary he is a young man who can be Trust
