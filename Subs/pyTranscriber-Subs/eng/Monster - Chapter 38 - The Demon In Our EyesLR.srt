1
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm supposed to shoot shoebox

2
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
So how come there's a fire

3
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
Amazing

4
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Amazing Johan amazing

5
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Come and watch the it's pretty

6
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480
Everyone is running and falling over each

7
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
Without a thought for anyone but themselves

8
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,280
Can you sense it in your the fear

9
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,928
Whether or not he is successful in his first kill

10
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
That's what it all comes down to

11
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Remember

12
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,864
Either he's got what it takes or he doesn't

13
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,448
So have you ever trained with a gun before

14
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
No

15
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
I guess that means that you're self taught

16
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Actually

17
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
I've never shot a gun before

18
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
What you mean not even once

19
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Right

20
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
Remember two shots

21
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,160
Whenever you fire your gun you always pull the trigger twice

22
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
Better is your chances of taking out your objective if you can do that then you're as good as dead

23
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
It's all over

24
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
I have to shoot

25
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,663
You won't be able to do it

26
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
I have to shoot you

27
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
I'm sure you can't

28
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,343
I have to kill you you're a doctor of Medicine

29
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
And you've dedicated your career to saving life

30
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
Taking life is my job

31
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
And I do it well

32
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
Give it up you can't do it

33
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,719
Remember two shots

34
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:11,199
I can do this

35
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
More shaking Yohan

36
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:30,399
Tim the

37
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,799
No I have got to get him now

38
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
Not getting away I won't let do it

39
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
Listen do not panic

40
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:34,399
The security guard so that we can it's no good sir

41
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,799
All the doors have been locked from the outside that can't be whatever

42
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
Can you tell me just where you plan on taking Mr shoovald in this Sea of Fire

43
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
The book stop running

44
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
So many of them alight the Flames quickly consuming everything they touch

45
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
Describe all of this with such damn calmness flames of Chaos

46
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
You're getting quite a thrill out of sharing this hellish scene with me aren't you it's

47
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
Now you always sounded when you read to me and now you're going to take my place

48
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
Giving up on something that's even more compelling is popped into my head

49
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
You're Not Afraid even now Mr Cheval answer

50
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
This where did you come from who are you or what

51
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,863
Can you see

52
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
I know you can barely see anything but when I'm this close to you

53
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
What can you see what

54
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
See you when you look into my eyes

55
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,439
I was born in a town that was straight out of a fair

56
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
Many people died there

57
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
And when I walked away

58
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
I have hands with my other self

59
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
To me it seemed like we were the only two people in the world

60
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:59,295
Neither one of us possessed a real name

61
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
Hey lady

62
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Wait it's you

63
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Peter

64
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
Do you know this young lady have you seen her somewhere before

65
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:02,527
Burning

66
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,591
I forgot some papers I need you to go retrieve them for me

67
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
Go to the mansion and get

68
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
They're on the desk in the study

69
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
These

70
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
It's my mom

71
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
It's like detective services

72
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Investigative report

73
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
About Margo Langer

74
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
Her death

75
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
Margo

76
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
Whose real name was helenka novakova

77
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
Was born in Prague to czechoslovak

78
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
On August 12th

79
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
55

80
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
In the spring of 197

81
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
When she was

82
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
15 years old

83
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,871
She somehow illegally gained entrance into former West Germany

84
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
4 years after entering Germany

85
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,063
Margo became a high-class call girl in mun

86
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,647
Clientele consisting mainly of politicians and influential

87
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Businessman

88
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
Even though her name was Secret in high SOC

89
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
He became famous

90
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
Our client in this investigation

91
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Hanske York

92
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
Was one of her more generous and steady

93
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Her father

94
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,543
Even after it all you were still trying to find out more about mother

95
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,919
At age 22 she bore Mr shoeval to son

96
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
That male child was given the name

97
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Of Carl

98
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Carl

99
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Are you listening to me

100
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
This is important

101
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
Take this money and ride the train on track number five

102
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,047
What about you Mom

103
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,863
Honey I already told you I can't go with you

104
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:31,007
I don't want to go alone mom you have no choice if you stay with me they'll cut you off to some orphanage

105
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
Around here people will mock you with the son of a w****

106
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Now go on

107
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
What about my dad

108
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
Why doesn't he help us doesn't he love me

109
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
Why do you abandon us

110
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
Don't hate him if he turns you away

111
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:59,167
Because Mommy doesn't hate him even now

112
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,039
Her son Carl was moved around to many different sets of foster parents

113
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
The young man went through a lot

114
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647
But eventually ended up in a loving family

115
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
He felt as if he was always

116
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
Always alone in the world

117
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,607
Of course it wouldn't say that in the report

118
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,471
Margo Langer remained a top high class prostitute

119
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
But retired in 1992

120
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Furthermore

121
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
There are rumors that Langer was involved in an affair with

122
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
The president of an underground Bank just

123
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Before her retirement

124
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
This information has not been confirmed

125
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
In investigating Margo's alleged affair

126
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,975
A lot of information was learned about this underground Banks operation

127
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:00,863
This Bank laundered money for Germany's Black Market companies for 5 years starting in 1991

128
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:07,519
Money laundering is the term used for an organization in the business of taking illegal funds and turning them into legal

129
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Currency

130
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
After her retirement from prostitution

131
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
Margo Langer left mun

132
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
Nick and lived in Offenbach

133
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
This is

134
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
Picture of the apartment building that she lived in at that time

135
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,207
She shared her third floor apartment with a young man about age 18

136
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
The nature of their relationship is unknown

137
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
Margo Langer lived in offen

138
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,655
For nearly 4 years until on November 2

139
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,727
1996 she was found dead on high

140
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
According to police files

141
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,335
Her death was the work of a phantom kill

142
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
The culprit was never found

143
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Mother

144
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,855
Margo Langer sent a letter to a close friend 3 months before her untimely death

145
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,695
You're able to obtain the letter and have attached a copy to this report

146
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
Oh my God

147
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,615
I have finally retired from working

148
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
And living a very peaceful life

149
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
In this

150
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
I'm filled with thoughts of my lost son

151
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
I also think about my best friend from Prague

152
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
We try to escape from Czechoslovakia together

153
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,583
But she was captured at the border and taken back to Prague

154
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Later

155
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
I heard she gave birth

156
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
The twins

157
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
And was very happy

158
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
Recently

159
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,847
I met a young man who was about the same age as my son

160
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,199
He looks exactly like my friend in PR

161
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
When I'm with him

162
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
I feel like I'm talking to my

163
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
Own son

164
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,975
I'm sure my boy has become a fine young man

165
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Just like

166
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,351
He must have grown up to live a happy life

167
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
That's what I hope for

168
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
I'm all right now Mom

169
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,847
I know that I'll never feel alone again

170
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,247
I know dad sent me here because he wanted me to read this

171
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,087
Now I get it finally I understand what she meant

172
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
I understand completely

173
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
It's all right

174
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Stand

175
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,567
Damn it every one of these doors has been locked tight Peter did you find a phone to call the fire department yet

176
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,967
Yes sir I called them how could this have happened what the hell's going on in there

177
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
Out of the way

178
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
Everyone move

179
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:44,607
So stupid question mark

180
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
Two shots left

181
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
Crazy

182
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
How

183
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
Hold on what are you doing

184
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
Nina Jones

185
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,384
Don't do it

186
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
Don't
