1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:05,888
Well Well you certainly have found an excellent piece of property

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,544
It's only a 20 minute drive to the center of Berlin perfectly situated in a convenient and love

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,312
Lovely neighborhood

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:19,456
It's rare to find a unique property of such caliber especially on the east side

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,248
I Can Only Imagine

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
If I'm not mistaken wasn't this the residents of Mr Liebert the former head of Commerce of East Germany

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,072
You don't know how buyer you just came to investigate Mr Liebert is that all

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,936
Please forgive me but I just need some information

9
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,312
I don't know anything about an official who died almost 10 years ago

10
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
Apparently Mr Liebert and his wife adopted fraternal twins during the time that they were here I told you I don't know

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,528
Anything well who owns the property

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,064
Can you direct me to them

13
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Listen a lot of the property in former East Germany used to be owned by Jews who had to flee during the Nazi regime

14
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,120
In some cases the government ended up borrowing land from people on the west side or in other countries

15
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
The owner of this property is overseas

16
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
Besides

17
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:18,080
My company is a Westside real estate firm that entered the Eastern Market after the wall hell

18
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:22,944
We don't know anything about the past now if you could please hurry and leave I'm locking up

19
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,504
Isn't there anyone who might remember

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
Could there possibly be someone who knew the leverts

21
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:33,696
It's like I already told you this was a residential area where many high-ranking officials live

22
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,512
Most of them fled soon after the wall came down

23
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,584
Especially the officials from the ministry of the interior

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
Come to think of it

25
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:48,800
An ex-official from the East German Department of Commerce lives about 10 houses away

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah I remember Mr Liebert

27
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
I'll never understand why you decided to take such a risk if only he had waited just a little longer until East Germany

28
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Collapsed

29
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,928
It makes you wonder why you went to a free country only to be killed in the end

30
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
It's a damn shame really

31
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,304
Do you remember if Mr Liebert had children twins perhaps

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
Did he have twins you say

33
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
Oh yes that's right

34
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,312
Mr Liebert adopted those twins from The Orphanage are you sure

35
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
That's right those two are such cute kids

36
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,200
Mr Liebert always did talk about wanting children

37
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
Which orphanage was it

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Which one was it

39
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
511

40
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,744
Yes that's right I believe they came from 511 kinderheim

41
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
I'm sorry

42
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
511 kinderheim

43
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,935
They're planning on turning this old orphanage into a supermarket sometime soon

44
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:34,079
About time thank goodness they're finally going to destroy this creepy building

45
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,735
Excuse me ma'am by any chance do you know anyone from this place

46
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
The orphanage

47
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
Everyone from there is long since gone

48
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,183
I really prefer not to talk about it

49
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
It was such a tragedy

50
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
But I if you want to find out more about it

51
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,471
There's a former official from the old Ministry of welfare named Hartman over on 47th Street

52
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Hello there

53
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,255
Do you know if a man named Hartman lives around here

54
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
Wait what's wrong you're injured

55
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Let me take a look

56
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
Don't be afraid I'm not going to hurt you

57
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
You reinjured an old wound

58
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
It's infected but this should help

59
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Attaboy

60
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
I know this stings but it'll help you get better

61
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
There you go all done

62
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Be careful okay

63
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
You might get hurt again

64
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Heart mon

65
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
After the fall of East Germany I became the foster parent to all those kids you see photographed up on the wall

66
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
Foster parent yes well it just means that I took care of them until they were adopted or eventually able to go

67
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Go off on their own

68
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,991
The boy in the middle was adopted by the president of an accessories company

69
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
And the last one on the left

70
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
Is enlisted in the army

71
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,719
I still have one left in my care right now and it must be hard work for you to tell the truth

72
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
I wouldn't call it

73
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
As the district official for the ministry of welfare I worked for many years dealing with orphans and I was Adam

74
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
Easily against the way the government handled them

75
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,151
After the fall of socialism I thought I'd try doing things my own way

76
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
I couldn't do any worse

77
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,039
Of course it isn't easy and I don't have many resources

78
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,647
But it's far better than the way they were living in that orphanage if you can call it that

79
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
The ministry of the interior and the ministry of welfare ran 511 kinderheim as a special or

80
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,959
Well all these German orphanages were pretty severe places to be

81
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,103
But these special orphanages were particularly notorious

82
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,431
It wasn't just an institution for children with nowhere to go

83
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,271
It was the place where children of criminals and political prisoners

84
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,063
Suspected dissidents were sent

85
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
Discrimination and inhumane cruelty

86
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,439
What part of everyday life for the children there

87
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,559
Those poor unfortunates were defenseless and couldn't do anything about their situation

88
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,655
Ironically it was a contradictory clash between socialism

89
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,983
And totalitarianism

90
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
The government claim they were reeducating them to be good citizens but in actuality behind closed doors

91
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:26,527
I wasn't away from the public eye those helpless children were treated like criminals even worse than criminals

92
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
The director and instructors were absolutely terrible

93
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,255
The worst of the bunch would confiscate care packages sent to the children and sell them to their own profit

94
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,071
Who then were the real criminals I ask you

95
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,447
Fear and violence rule the daily lives of those poor children and those special orphanages

96
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
You can't raise normal people that way

97
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,711
And then one day that incident happened incident what exactly do you mean by that

98
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,831
Well when you came here you said that you wanted to ask me about the twins didn't you

99
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,903
Yes that's right can you tell me anything at all about them

100
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,303
I don't know much about the girl except that she was left at an orphanage in a different District but the boy

101
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
I'll always remember the brother Johan

102
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:19,519
Johan yes please tell me whatever there is to know

103
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
What happened they kept everyone

104
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
From finding out

105
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
The East German government placed a strict gag order on it well it is in the past

106
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
So I suppose it's all right I guess there's no harm in talking to you about the incident so what are you talking

107
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
Talking about I need to know

108
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
What's your hun too

109
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
Then uprising

110
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
I'm home

111
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Diet

112
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,759
We have company come here and say hello to him why don't you

113
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
Diet

114
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
Where are your manners

115
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
Well are you going to greet the man or not oh it's okay

116
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,743
We already met earlier out in front of the building

117
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
Remember

118
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
Please continue Mr Hartman

119
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
I'd like to hear more

120
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,471
No I'm sorry I can't not in front of the child

121
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Understood

122
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,359
Well it's late can we continue this another time

123
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
Maybe you'd like to stay and have dinner with us

124
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Sure

125
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
If you don't mind

126
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Mr 10

127
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:52,959
You say that you're a freelance journalist does that mean you're going to write an article about the things we've been talking about

128
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:59,103
Eventually when you do write your article please be sure to emphasize this

129
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,223
The moral development of a child all depends on the adult that raises him

130
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,831
It is essential that we encourage every child to follow the proper path

131
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,719
If we do they'll be able to achieve their dreams and have a happy life

132
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Dreams huh

133
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Hey diet

134
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
What are your dreams

135
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
A soccer ball

136
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
I want a soccer ball

137
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799

138
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,991
Thank you for dinner I was hoping we could continue our conversation another time of course I am sorry

139
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,295
Sorry we couldn't finish it up tonight Mr 10

140
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
I'll be back

141
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
Perhaps I can come by tomorrow

142
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Well did

143
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,007

147
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135

Mr Hartman Mr Hartman what's wrong please open up

149
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
Mr Hartman

150
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
Mr Denmark

151
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
Teacher what happened to him he was playing he was standing on a chair

It's your heart man call an ambulance quick all right

157
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
Detail let me take a look

158
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
My God

159
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
What are all these bruises

160
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Does this hurt

161
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
What about here

162
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
So if your ribs are fractured

163
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
And also

164
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:43,455
Your shoulder is dislocated how did you get this injury from falling off a chair

165
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
The ambulance is on the way and should be here soon so everything's going to be all right good

166
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,463
But where these bruises come from I said everything's all right

167
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,863
You can leave now Mr tinma but your hands just now it was like you're examining him

168
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
It's as if you are a doctor well Ten Mile I thought I heard that

169
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
Somewhere before you are a doctor aren't you the one wanted for murder

170
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
These bruises just how did he get these bruises all over

You shouldn't worry about the boy you've got your own problems don't you the police

I mean you're the one who's wanted for murder doctor

176
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
You're very short tempered just like a fugitive

177
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
You did this to him didn't you did what what do you mean you're the one who's been abusing

178
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,231
Why I'd never do such a thing to an innocent child

179
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
Right Dieter

180
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:12,031
What are you doing I'm taking teacher to the hospital first murder and now kidnapping

181
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
Don't move the police will catch you eventually

182
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
It's okay to

183
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:31,231
We'll be at the hospital soon I'm scared I'm scared of the hospital there's nothing to be afraid

184
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:37,631
The doctors will take good care of you but Mr Harmon is always the one who took care of me every time

185
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,215
Time I got hurt before

186
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
What are you telling me

187
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,895
You're completely covered in scars and bruises and you've never been to a hospital

188
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
I'm scared

189
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,295
The world is full of bad things that's why I have to become stronger

190
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,879
If I'm going to fight all the bad things I have to be

191
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
Stronger

192
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
Is that what heart mom told you

193
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
The world is dark

194
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
The futures

195
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
And that isn't true

196
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
The world's not a dark place that's a lie

197
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Really

198
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Yes really

199
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Oh I almost forgot

200
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
This soccer ball is for you

201
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
Tomorrow will be a good day

202
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
I promise

203
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,327
I'm sorry for coming so late thank you nurse

204
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
But the ER is pretty busy at the moment

205
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,447
It might end up being a while before we can treat him

206
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
I can't you move him up at all

207
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,311
There is a very big accident I'm sorry

208
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,151
So we need to ask the truck driver about the circumstances of the accident

209
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,967
You broke both his legs but he can still talk any

210
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
We have to treat him first

211
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,575
You can question him after we're done

212
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,671
All right then we'll wait right here until he's ready I see

213
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:11,071
I'll be back in 2 hours please just do what you can to take care of the boy

214
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,471
And whatever you do please be sure not to let anyone else take him away I will be coming back to get him

215
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,871
I owe you one is the accident site cleaned up yet

216
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
Traffic still backed up okay what should I do now

217
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,671
First what to do with Dieter even if I call the police I can't go with him

218
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:43,071
I don't know much about the girl except that she was left at an

219
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
In a different District

220
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
A different orphanage wait that's it

221
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,271
There's a child that you want me to take in

222
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,087
Well are you the child's parent

223
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
What are you doing coming here at this hour I'm sorry I know it's a strange request but this child needs you

224
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,815
Look I understand that the child is being abused

225
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,655
But if I don't know who you are then how can I

226
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:24,287
I just I can't take in a child from a suspicious person who won't even identify himself

227
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Wait

228
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,175
Did Anna Liebert live here with you with this orphanage by any chance

229
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
Hold on a second

230
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
Are you saying that you know Anna Liebert

231
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
That's right

232
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
So you do remember Anna

233
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
Yes of course I do

234
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,023
How is Anna is she doing well for herself

235
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
Yes

236
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,887
She's currently taking classes at Heidelberg University

237
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,959
Really then I guess she's doing very well

238
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
Anna was such a nice girl

239
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,847
I heard she was adopted by Mr Liebert of the Commerce Ministry

240
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,407
Along with her twin brother

241
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,735
What was his name again Johan

242
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:11,135
That was it his name was Johan they were truly very close I felt so sorry for them when they had to be separated but they

243
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
They had to be placed in different orphanages

244
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:19,583
Before the two of them arrived here they only had each other they were truly alone in this world

245
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,471
They were found walking hand in hand near the border of Czechoslovakia

246
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Just the two of them

247
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,919
Shivering all alone in the cold at first Mr Liebert was only going to adopt

248
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,783
No hunts but Johan wouldn't go anywhere without his sister there was no separating them

249
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,135
Thankfully Anna was able to live a happy life because of her brother

250
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:49,791
I heard that the conditions in the orphanages in East Germany were pretty terrible not all orphanages were like

251
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
511 kinderheim

252
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,687
Inga deer the bathroom is the other way

253
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
Down the hall okay

254
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:15,135
It's all right it's

255
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:21,536
Right there's nothing to be afraid of now you can go to the bathroom by yourself can't you

256
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
These poor children have never really felt the love of a parent in order to develop as a person

257
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
The only thing you need is love

258
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:42,528
The orphanages of the East Side were truly horrible places for the children to grow up in everything was so

259
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,624
Doing personal even this place was only known by the number 47

260
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
You'd better believe we did everything we could do within our power so that we wouldn't be controlled by the

261
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,424
Pregnant we weren't going to be another 511 kinderheim it was a

262
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
Orphanage controlled by the ministry of welfare and the ministry of the Interior do you know what that means

263
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
No

264
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:13,760
The reality was it was a Ministry of the Interiors Pet Project East Germany was using

265
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:20,160
That place for experimentation on the children
