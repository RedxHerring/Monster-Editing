1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:07,936
How many times do you plan on coming here you can ask me until you're blue in the face I'm always going to tell you the same thing

2
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:12,288
Councilman boltzman didn't have sex with that woman that prostitute

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,336
This had better be your last visit

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,664
I would hate to have to take action against you take action

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
Are you going to sue for defamation

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
No

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,016
You wouldn't dare

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
You're a secretary

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,904
You wouldn't want councilman boltzman's name to come up in a case like this

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,720
Inspector are you threatening me

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,512
No of course not

12
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,328
I simply want to know the truth of the matter that's all

13
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,744
I know he works for a hot shot politician but man that guy's not going to give an inch

14
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
No

15
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
Who come around boltzman's got a pretty good thing going here why risk it all on some random prostit

16
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
The victim was no ordinary prostitute the names of countless politicians and business

17
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
Were traced back to her well yeah but there's only one person who claims to have seen them both

18
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
It's at the same Hotel

19
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,648
Just cuz they stayed at the same Hotel doesn't make him a John if you decoded her client list for me

20
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,256
Actually we're still working on cracking that code it's a lot tougher than we thought

21
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
I'll do it myself

22
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
Just give me the disc

23
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
Great but don't you already have a bunch of other cases on your plate it doesn't matter give it to me

24
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,848
There's something I've been meaning to ask you for a while

25
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
What is it well how do you find the time to sleep what does that have to do with the case

26
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
Huh

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
It's an irrelevant question Detective

28
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
Well have you gotten the chance to talk to him it doesn't really matter when we tell him he doesn't

29
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:21,216
Listen he stopped listening to me a long time ago I know but the sooner you tell him the better keep it down

30
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
You're being too loud

31
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
He's here you know working in his office yeah I wonder why

32
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
Damn it are you still trying to connect councilman boltzmann to the murder of

33
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:48,352
That prostitute is there a problem with that Chief yes

34
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
From the ministry of the interior

35
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,288
You're just going to have to smooth things out like you usually do no I can't unburn any more bridges for you

36
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,592
It's too big do whatever you can chief

37
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:03,968
Give me a break here Loom gay you're good but you're only human sometimes you're going to be wrong

38
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
Are you going to risk your entire career on a dead hooker

39
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,648
Come on do you need another feather in your cap

40
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:16,000
God don't tell me you're doing this for the principle of the thing

41
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
Justice

42
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
I'm not interested in either

43
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,959
All I know is a woman was murdered in Cold Blood

44
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,543
I'm just interested in finding the killer nothing else matters to me

45
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,599
Excuse me inspector you have a visitor

46
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Got it

47
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,487
I managed to figure out the encryption that she was using

48
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,071
Use this formula to get all the names on our Client List oh

49
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
From that woman is here again sir

50
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
You know the one

51
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,799
Hey you can't just come back here we've been over this before

52
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,663
When will 10 be arrested you have all you need

53
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063
It seems like you've been drinking quite a bit this morning just so you know

54
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,159
I've already figured out the case regarding Dr Tenma

55
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
He insists that everything is the work of a man called Johan but this Johann is just another personality

56
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
Within 10 was mind

57
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:29,727
If you think about it with this hypothesis what seemed illogical now makes sense

58
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
Well we have to do at this point is just wait for the police to capture him

59
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:40,735
So that means it's not your problem once you got an arrest warrant is that what you're saying there are a lot of things I would like to

60
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
Ask him when we finally meet

61
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Doctor Tenma

62
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
What an interesting individual he is

63
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,487
However I have so many other cases piling up on my desk as we speak

64
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
If you'll excuse me

65
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,703
Don't you people ever let up

66
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,823
I told you councilman boltzman has an alibi for that night

67
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
Of course he did

68
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
The murder was a professional

69
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
I'm sorry

70
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
Are you honestly suggesting that my employer hired a hit man to kill that girl ridiculous I've cracked the

71
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,903
Code on the list of clients of the woman who was killed

72
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,743
Councilman boltzman's name was on that list

73
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,607
You know even if that were the case it still doesn't prove that he had her killed

74
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
Right

75
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
Come to think of it that's as far as we've gotten

76
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,543
I'm sure you'll be in touch now leave

77
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,151
We're dead in the water without a Smoking Gun wouldn't you say

78
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,247
Are you familiar with the Publishing House called shellhorn

79
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:51,647
They're not a major company but they stay in business by publishing tell all books on famous people

80
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Like politicians

81
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
They're known to play very dirty

82
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,095
They hire unscrupulous women to build relationships with famous men

83
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,655
In order to create scandals to write about

84
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
If I were you

85
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,495
I'd watch out for people like that

86
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:34,399
Check and mate you should have seen it it was great boltzman's guy just stared at him like what

87
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,751
Blunga is unbelievable nearest I can tell all he does is work

88
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
He's a robot I'm telling you

89
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,127
Man I hear you the guy barely seems human to me

90
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:53,087
All right speaking of Checkmate there it is what the hell hey don't put into our game buddy

91
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,415
You shouldn't waste your time with my numbing games

92
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,815
It seems after a simple little threat the president of the Publishing Company chose to confess write a report

93
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Here

94
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
What do you think you're looking at

95
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
It's at call girls notebook

96
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:18,943
It records the date and time and other details of encounters with a certain client

97
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,247
I can't really tell you the man's name

98
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
He's only referred to here by the initial b

99
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,463
Not to mention shellhorn publishing also made arrangements with the woman to release her autobiography

100
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
Interesting

101
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
Don't you think

102
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Oh by the way

103
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:41,215
Have you ever been in contact with a man named yanker you may be aware that he is a professional Hitman

104
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
I want you to leave

105
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,991
You get the hell out of here now

106
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
We're moving out both of us right now level with me you never even

107
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
Even noticed I was pregnant not even now did you are you going to the man or father to your child what do you

108
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:18,591
There I bet you didn't even notice that I was having an affair with another man did you

109
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
Please understood I

110
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
I have to go we can talk about this later

111
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:03,391
Inspector what just happened here

112
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Councilman Boltzmann's an innocent man

113
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,367
Not much of a suicide note but that's all we got

114
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Looney

115
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,999
I'm handing this one over to inspector Kaminski

116
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:45,887
I'm giving him the reichner park in gallon murder cases too given what happened I think it's for the best

117
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
So then

118
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
What am I supposed to do now

119
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
Get your head together

120
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Then we'll talk about work

121
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:30,431
Well doctor Tenma it seems there's nothing left to distract me

122
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:37,343
Sorry inspector you have a visitor

123
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
It's a behind a man

124
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,719
I could tell her to come back another day if you know

125
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
No children

126
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,271
I had a great time Eva

127
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,647
How long until next time

128
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Not sure babe

129
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
Maybe when I return from my next business trip

130
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,119
Oh I don't want to give you back to your wife come on stay all right

131
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,519
I'll give you a call

132
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:34,175
No you won't be coming back not after getting in trouble for that perfumed handkerchief that I carefully placed in

133
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
Suitcase you stupid bastard

134
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,159
You were eavesdropping again weren't you

135
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,487
You must see all the different men I'm with isn't that right

136
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
Well what then you want to join in the fun is that it no of course not you pervert

137
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,007
You're wrong and I mean I just I forget how nice it is

138
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
It's beautiful

139
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
I really love this Garden

140
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,503
Looking at all this Greenery helps me forget about the distasteful things out there

141
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,599
I'm so glad that you like it I'm going to plant some mimosas here

142
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
Bent over there I'm planning to put up an arch for your roses when summer gets here it's going to be beautiful

143
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,399
If maybe someone like you could be up to the task so what do you think

144
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
Do you think you can make me happy

145
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
Hey Dad are you listening to me

146
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
Dad

147
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,503
Oh how is my cooking today am I getting any better

148
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
You haven't heard a single word I said have you Dad

149
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
How come you're always daydreaming

150
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,183
I bet you that's why Mom ran off with another man

151
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
I'm sorry

152
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
It's fine

153
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Really

154
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
Actually

155
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Coletta

156
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Yeah

157
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
If Daddy

158
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Found

159
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
Someone he really liked

160
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
No forget it it's nothing

161
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
My cooking is pretty awful right

162
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
Come on tell the truth it's not so bad

163
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
I see

164
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Not bad huh

165
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
Sorry for the trouble

166
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:29,887
You're a gardener but I'm asking you to do all these odd jobs no problem my handyman kept asking for time off and

167
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Quit

168
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
Well I'll do everything I can to help

169
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
So how about dinner tonight

170
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Oh well

171
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
Okay

172
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
Why are you nervous

173
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
Well I'm not used to expensive restaurants like this

174
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,191
You must be confident wherever you go

175
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,007
Just pretend you're working in my garden right now

176
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:13,407
Yes that's right I do feel pretty confident when I'm out there working on something new in the yard

177
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,015
I Feel So Satisfied when a garden turns out the way I envisioned it

178
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
I just love being out there you know

179
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,135
People who like Gardens can't be all that bad

180
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,951
And you did say you like that Garden the other day

181
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:32,095
Are you trying to say that I'm a good person yeah of course

182
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Well go on

183
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
You

184
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
You know

185
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
Kind of lonely

186
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
I'm not the only one

187
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
I'm guessing that you're lonely too

188
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
I'm sorry

189
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,079
My daughter's probably worried about me so I should get going

190
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:38,399
It's almost Christmas Coletta he doesn't have to come this year

191
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
Hey come on sweetie don't say things like that Dad celebrating Christmas Just the Two of Us sounds lonely

192
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
Let's not do anything okay yeah well it might not just be the two of us celebrating this year you know

193
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,279
The man you're looking at in those photographs ruined my life

194
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,095
Sorry I was just cleaning up

195
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
His name is Kenzo Tenma

196
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
He's my ex fian

197
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,543
You're drinking again at this time of day well of course I've been drinking

198
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,615
I just went to see inspector loon gave the bka

199
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:25,247
Can you believe that useless incompetent inspector sent me away

200
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
All I want to know is when they're going to arrest them

201
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
The pka

202
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:36,511
The rest he killed my father and then ran away oh he says he's innocent but he's

203
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Not fooling anybody

204
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:44,191
My future should have been gilded and gold as the daughter of the director of a large hospital and my three divorces

205
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,287
Everything is his fault and he blames the murders on your home

206
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:53,407
This is Johan with my father do you think that this child could kill anyone

207
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
Is that really what timma told you

208
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
It's either nons

209
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,135
Have you ever shown this Photograph to the police course not

210
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:07,231
I don't know it could be important evidence Maybe

211
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,071
Lego says he has a split personality dammit

212
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Then tell me

213
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,495
Why do you still keep framed pictures of them like this around the house years later

214
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
I figured deep down

215
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
You think Tema is innocent

216
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
You still have

217
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
Feelings for him

218
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
You watch too many soap oper

219
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,719
Out of all the men I've ever met Kenzo satisfied the most of my requirements

220
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:45,119
His position suited me he was an elite neurosurgeon who many considered a genius besides he spoiled me

221
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
And best of all he never contradicted me

222
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,823
He just listened to my every single request yes yes yes he was the man who always said yes to me

223
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:00,223
That man could have made me the happiest person in the world do you understand what I'm saying

224
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,295
I think I would ever be able to fill his shoes

225
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:08,415
I'd be willing to tend your Gardens for the rest of my life

226
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,719
If that would help to ease your pain any

227
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:29,151
Knock knock yourself just because I slept with you once you were just something to pass the time I was bored

228
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:35,551
That's all I was playing with you and you fell for it you fool who Do You Think You Are

229
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
Truly a sad and lonely person

230
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:49,119
So are you

231
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
On Christmas Day I'm having a party at my house with my daughter you're welcome to join us

232
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
Well Dad everything looks delicious

233
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
Did you really make this all by yourself

234
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Yep

235
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,719
I can't guarantee it'll be good

236
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,023
Do you think so

237
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
Mom's coming home for Christmas

238
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
Charlotte

239
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
Mommy

240
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,375
I'm so sorry to hear

241
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,655
I'm sorry

242
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,480
Who cares about Mim

243
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:46,880
Or about Frozen or beautiful gardens or this whole damn estate

244
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:53,280
Thought of it means anything to me now just let it burn

245
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,176
Welcome back

246
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,528
So inspector loon gay you finally decided to listen to me

247
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
I had some time open up that's all

248
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,744
This man was my only hope I must see to it that his life is ruined

249
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
Or I can never be happy again
