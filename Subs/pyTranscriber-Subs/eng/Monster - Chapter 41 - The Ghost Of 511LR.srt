1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,328
So Mr pedrov

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,424
Oh my mistake your real name is reinhard-beerman isn't it

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,312
There was this very special orphanage located in East Berlin right

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:18,176
It was an experimental lab where the staff did personality Corrections on the children that were house there

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,504
It was called 511 kinderheim

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,808
And you were the director there Mr bear

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,464
You should know all about the abuse that went on there

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,048
Just what were you trying to achieve in those experiments

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
Back in East Berlin

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
511 kinderheim

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
Care to explain it to me

12
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,808
Hey please wait a minute don't rush off Mr pedrov

13
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
You're unique

14
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,416
You're both a psychologist and a psychiatrist

15
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,280
You used to work for the Internal Affairs Ministry focusing on personality programming

16
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
The form of brainwashing

17
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
You see that's what got me thinking

18
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,592
Why would someone with your skills and behavioral modification have been appointed director of Amir orphanage

19
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
I mean certainly there were people more qualified in the field of child welfare

20
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
Right

21
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
Leave me alone

22
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
I don't know what you're talking about

23
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
Just go away

24
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,440
So where did you hide the records

25
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,024
You know the results of your experiments at 511 kinderheim

26
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,912
Now I've heard all the usual rumors that when the Berlin Wall was destroyed

27
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
A countless number of secret documents disappeared

28
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,848
And there's a theory that they were sent to the Soviet Union by train via Romania

29
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,968
While on Route there was a revolution in Romania that Chao sheshko government fell

30
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,784
And supposedly the German documents were lost

31
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:40,928
But I have a feeling that the data concerning 511 kinderheim was not among those lost papers

32
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
Do you know why I think that

33
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
Because you sir are a true academic

34
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
You're devoted to research

35
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,568
Data and statistics are far more important to use scholarly types than life itself

36
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
You wouldn't let go of something that important would you

37
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
I'd sure like to see that data

38
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Must be interesting

39
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
There's nothing

40
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,112
What were you hoping to accomplish there

41
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,928
At your lab at 511 kinderheim

42
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,024
Go away your experiments with a really successful

43
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:31,359
It must have given you so much pleasure to use children as human guinea pigs

44
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Your experiment

45
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Failed didn't it

46
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,863
In 1985

47
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,191
511 kinderheim burned to the ground

48
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
And according to the rumors surrounding that tragedy

49
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
Children of the orphanage killed each other

50
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
At the time

51
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,919
I was no longer director of that facility

52
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
The incident does not involve me at all

53
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
I see

54
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
Lucky you you were able to escape death

55
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:17,951
Now the director right after you wasn't so lucky he was the first one killed in the Rampage

56
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,303
That catastrophe never would have occurred if I had still been there

57
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,119
I assure you my experiment was a success

58
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,703
Boho so now it seems you're admitting to it

59
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,543
You're telling me the experiment went well so I shouldn't need proof

60
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Right

61
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
Huh

62
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
You know what I think

63
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:42,271
Even if many of the records went up and smoke during that fire in 1985 not everything did

64
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,183
The experimental data from your time is director of 511 kinderheim is still intact somewhere

65
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,767
Careful you're treading on dangerous territory right now

66
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
Who knows what could happen

67
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
That almost sounds like a threat

68
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,007
You should know I'm not afraid of taking risks get lost

69
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Sorry

70
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,127
I'm going to follow you everywhere until I get the information I'm after

71
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Back off

72
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,503
I'm warning you not to ever come near me again just disappear

73
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
People we found you

74
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,535
We've been looking for you you were gone a long time

75
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
Hey who's that guy with you

76
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
Forget about him he's nobody

77
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
Come along let's go home

78
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
Walk away leave this alone

79
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,087
Living out the remainder of his life peacefully surrounded by his grandkids

80
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
To think back then

81
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
He did such horrible things to children

82
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Who is it

83
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,063
Do you have a delivery from Mr pedrov Sir

84
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Mr pedrov

85
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
Sure give me a minute

86
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:55,391
Corner rooms with a bad view are convenient especially in moments like these

87
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Wow

88
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,567
It's been a hell of a morning I almost didn't make it out here

89
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,639
Yeah a couple of strange men showed up at my hotel room

90
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
Here we

91
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
Watching your grandchildren play

92
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
This is wonderful

93
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
Life is good

94
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
You know when I was working for a newspaper an oldies Germany I couldn't even dream of A Moment Like This thankfully times have

95
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,911
No I'm a freelance journalist writing whatever I want gosh

96
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:43,263
That was unimaginable just a few years ago back in our socialist society

97
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Being free is nice

98
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,919
I've been watching you ever since I left the hotel did you know that

99
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Great home

100
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,855
I saw you when you came out the front door and thought to myself he has a lot of space

101
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
I'll bet you have nice big rooms

102
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
I'll keep must be difficult

103
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
And rents expensive isn't it

104
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
Spending the whole day at a cafe

105
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
Taking walks and playing with your grandchildren

106
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,703
All the while maintaining is leisurely lifestyle without working

107
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
So I wondered

108
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,543
Where do you get the money to afford this

109
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
You must have sold something

110
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
Maybe the data to your failed experiment

111
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Did you get a good price

112
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,807
I told you it was a success

113
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
That's all the more reason for it to get a good price

114
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
Just leave me alone

115
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,487
I have nothing to say to you

116
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
Now go

117
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
There they are again earlier he was at the movies with those two

118
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:07,231
Now they're all eating parfait

119
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:20,031
Each time they look different one two three three

120
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
Sex

121
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
This is Mr pedrov's home right

122
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
May I come inside

123
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Hey there

124
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
This is horrible

125
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:26,239
I know what he's up to he's doing it again

126
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
Right here he's trying to replicate the very same EXP

127
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
Unconscionable

128
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
How could that man do this

129
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
She's trying to replicate

130
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
The very same experiment

131
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
511 kinter

132
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,383
There's a red light district at the German border

133
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,479
These boys were born there but we're never nurtured

134
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,063
And some were just abandoned by their impoverished mothers

135
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
Their business fell off when the Berlin Wall came down

136
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
So you just went there and gathered up all these children

137
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,351
For the purpose of continuing your 511 kinderheim experiment here

138
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,447
Oh Mr pedrov I didn't realize you had a guest

139
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
Don't worry about him

140
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,103
He's going home now I was planning to prepare dinner

141
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,663
Will Connecticut be all right for tonight

142
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Yes

143
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,527
Everyone loves your Kennedy leaky so much that would be just perfect

144
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,463
You're convinced I'm continuing with 511 kinderheim

145
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,535
I will tell you again

146
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
I have no need to continue that experiment

147
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
That project was a huge success

148
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Oh yeah

149
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Based on what

150
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,567
The educational program I created for the experiment

151
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,431
It's shaped personality so they were eager to absorb all kinds of knowledge

152
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
Educational

153
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
There was nothing educational about it

154
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
Human experimentation Dam

155
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
Calm down and think about it for a moment

156
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,975
What is the purpose of Education

157
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,119
Isn't it supposed to help people acquire Knowledge and Skills to become useful members of society

158
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,239
The instructor is main task is to create conditions to stimulate learning

159
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,335
All education is an experiment

160
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,735
At 511 tenderheim everyone was challenged to learn

161
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,319
I highly Advanced educational system was established

162
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,367
You did such a horrible things

163
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
And now you want to justify them

164
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
Horrible things yes think about what your Advanced protocols did to their minds you're a

165
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
Freelance writer you don't possess the scientific background to critique my procedures

166
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
What's with that look

167
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
What about the incident where the children killed each other

168
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
You deny your experiment was the cause of that I told you that happened after

169
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,231
I was removed from my position as director

170
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:33,887
The emergence of an unexpected anomaly through the entire program out of control

171
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Unexpected anomaly

172
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,287
Like what

173
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
Like Darkness

174
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:48,735
Hatred apathy destructive urges

175
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:55,135
Unfortunately people easily succumb to these negative forces once they get in they're hard to stop

176
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,975
Stop and soon they possessed all of 511 kinderh

177
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:05,375
Yes one boy arrived and all that began I suppose next you're going to tell me that

178
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
Didn't have anything to do with you as I keep telling you the experiment was very successful that's

179
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Lie and you know it

180
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,407
All those children at 511 kinderheim shared a common character flaw

181
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,711
There was one thing they could not do

182
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
They were incapable of loving

183
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,087

Now then our little chat is over and I would like you to leave

185
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,559
Don't even think of telling anyone about this place sorry

00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
You're breaking one of this country's loss I have to report this to the police I think you're forgetting you're not

00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
The Czech Republic is a democracy they frown upon things like an unauthorized orphanage with an unlic

189
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
Director you want to make a deal that's what this is

190
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:59,135

191
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
And I give you all the data from my experiment

192
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327

Listen up everyone

199
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,079
Mr Petrov and I are sort of working out a deal

200
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:54,943
And I want you guys to help me make the right decision in this matter because it concerns all of

201
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,783
If I reported him to the proper authorities

202
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,575
Then you'd all be free to go

203
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
I mean you'd like to leave wouldn't you

204

Can you hear me

213
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,671
Mr Petrov tell me who shot you

214
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,487
Walmart

215
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Woman

216
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:29,055
Mr petroff please tell me

217
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
Did you alter the program this time

218
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
The

219
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
The card

220
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,319
And the secret code number

221
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
You'll find them

222
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,183
Hidden behind the third drawer of my desk

223
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,743
Therefore my safety deposit box

224
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,327
With the experiment data and tape can be found

225
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
What

226
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
Of an interview

227
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
With a certain boy

228
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
Recalling his past

229
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,055
Under the use of chemically

230
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
Induced hypnotism

231
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
That boy is the malevolent monster

232
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,735
His darkness and evil influence

233
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,295
Let 511 kinderheim

234
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:17,952
To destruction

235
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
So now

236
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
What do you think

237
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
Are these children

238
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
Lacking anything in the development

239
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
Mr pedrov I don't know but it appears you educated them differently than

240
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
511 kinderheim

241
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
Apath

242
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Hat

243
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
Destructive urges

244
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,392
Dark Forces I wanted them to repel but how could I do that

245
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
What would make them resistant that was love

246
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Yes it was that's the new discovery I factored in Mr Petrov

247
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
Love isn't any new discovery parents give it to their children all the time

248
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,432
An experiment
