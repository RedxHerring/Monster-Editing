1
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:19,456
Did you get that dress I made it myself

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,816
You're an unfamiliar face get yourself a permit if you're looking to do business here

3
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:40,960
Last thing I need is an unlicensed hooker

4
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
Yeah good luck with that

5
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,848
I just need permission from him don't I

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
You let me meet him

7
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,968
Sorry I got no idea who you mean

8
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,528
I'll keep coming back until I meet him

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,344
Until

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,136
I meet the baby

11
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
You can't catch the ball with your hands like that you're not the goalkeeper with your whining who died and made you rap

12
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,608
Where the hell did you go to go

13
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Where'd you go

14
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
10 my dummy 10 mile

15
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:53,056
He told me to stay with you for a while cuz he found the man he was looking for that's all

16
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
That's all

17
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
Who leaves a kid with someone like me

18
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
No way in hell thanks a lot of time I have to babysit I hate kids first he drops

19
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,880
The piece of the earth and then he Saddles me with some random brat

20
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
Me and him had an agreement doesn't it mean nothing anymore what the hell kind of doctor doesn't want to make some easy money

21
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
Son of a

22
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,728
Did I look like I was ready to you hey

23
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,568
Remember what I said you can't use your hands that's a yellow card

24
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
I'm throwing this into traffic if you mentioned the rules one more time you keep talking like that you'll get a red card

25
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Shut up

26
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
Why the hell are you so late

27
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Hurry up and give me the stuff

28
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
Give me the stuff now

29
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,911
Long time no see detective Messner

30
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Dr Tim

31
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,615
That's right that's exactly what you called me back when we first met before I even got around to telling you

32
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
What my occupation was

33
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
But that was a long time ago

34
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
My days and Medicine are over

35
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
But I suppose you're no longer Detective

36
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,415
Detective suspended on narcotics charges

37
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,791
This article really came as a shock when I read it 6 months ago

38
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,887
Don't even think about running away

39
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,215
I have a gun trained on you under my jacket

40
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,871
All right what do you want with me

41
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,967
I need answers what happened in Heidelberg almost a year ago

42
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,807
And who was behind it all who ordered you to do such a terrible thing

43
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,391
I don't know anything

44
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,975
You killed the foreigners and Mr Mauer from the post

45
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
It wasn't me that did it

46
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,423
I was hired as the lookout that's all my partner Mueller he did it he killed all of them

47
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,775
Detective Mueller also left the force soon after the murders

48
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Yeah he did

49
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,407
I hear that he's very well off turns out he's doing good with his money

50
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,759
You on the other hand ended up wasting all of your money on your drug habit

51
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,159
That sound about right who took on the job and he was the one who committed the murders he ended up getting a

52
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,303
They even tried to get rid of me they tried to kill me to make sure I didn't go to the cops

53
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
I'm surprised you're still breathing

54
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
It was the organization that helped me

55
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Organization

56
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,567
Enough I already told her too much as it is

57
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967
Told her her who leave me alone already I can't I

58
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,575
Can't deal with you right now looks like you're going through withdrawal

59
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,463
And with me sitting here no dealer would come within 20 ft of you so I suggest you start talking

60
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
I thought I was

61
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,167
I was saved by the baby baby

62
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,751
Go to a pub called candy you can find him there

63
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,311
Wait who's this baby you're talking about

64
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
He's all right wing extremist

65
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,711
These also a high official and two of their major political parties

66
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
After the wall fell

67
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,855
The baby tried to create a town of only pure blooded Germans

68
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,927
But his plan failed and now he's come back

69
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
But why'd he do it

70
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Why do you bother saving you

71
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
The darkness

72
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
After the Berlin Wall fell

73
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
A great Darkness was created

74
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
A monster

75
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
A monster was born

76
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
A monster

77
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
Now leave me alone I've already said everything to that girl you understand what girl Messner she came

78
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,695
She's the daughter of that older couple we murdered you're saying

79
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:31,583
I mean Nina Nina Fortner came to see you then

80
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
The baby said to me that I

81
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,263
That I was to send that girl to him if I ever saw or if she ever showed up around these parts

82
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
He said

83
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
That she's important to use as bait

84
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
He's using her

85
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
As base

86
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,367
You don't give up do you

87
00:07:54,623 --> 00:08:00,767
You're getting to be a regular coming back all the time how about I rent you for an hour or

88
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
So the night ain't a total waste

89
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:09,727
You are the one you said I'd get in trouble if I did business without the babies permission

90
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
Yeah not so clever now are you

91
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,455
Is this the girl who keeps asking to see the baby

92
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Yes sir

93
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
It seems you're getting your wish

94
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
Don't keep him waiting

95
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
Please wait right here

96
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
Stand on that imot

97
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
If you'd be so kind

98
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255

99
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071

Both of your feet I have to dance

Only 150 Grand I could get $800,000 for a rug as fancy is that

I'm sure I'll think of something

146
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,183

Stupid I wouldn't do business in a dump like this

152
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,679
A friend of mine was just abducted by a bunch of guys who are regulars there what it seems like she found out

153
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,103
A secret I don't know what it's all about but I have to find her before something bad happens

154
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:13,503
A woman I know is in there too I have to get her out she

What is this woman look like does she have long blonde hair don't know I couldn't tell you what she looks like now

156
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,303
Because they just took a young blonde girl away in a car

157
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,103
It was big and red I don't know all right then I've got a track down that red car before it's too late

Without your gun

163
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
On this point I'm afraid I must insist

164
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
Thank you for your cooperation

165
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
Go ahead and sit wherever you like

166
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
So the baby brought you in here

167
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,223
Eyes forward let me see your face

168
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295

00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,111
But I should have known you'd be quite a beauty

170
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,439
After all you are a Johan's twin sister

171
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
My name is Professor guidlitz

172
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,591
And the man standing next to Johan in the picture is General wolf

173
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:20,479
We created this organization along with a pair of other like-minded individuals

174
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Where are my manners

175
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
Would you care for some fruit

176
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
No thank you I want to see Johan

177
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
And see him you will

178
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,535
Once he knows that you're here no force on Earth could keep him away

179
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
The boys suffers mightily in your absence

180
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,423
You people don't know where Johann is either do you

181
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
We need him

182
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
His country needs him

183
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,359
We for shall help him fulfill his destiny

184
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,527
Do you have any idea how Hitler became possessed of such power

185
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,439
It's because he saw the three things a person would have to do to gain control of a country

186
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,143
Manipulate the banks feed the War Machine and take command of the military

187
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:17,055
I'm sure johans working on one of those things right now or

188
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
Who really it's a question of if not when

189
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,199
What exactly do you plan to do with Johan think of it

190
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
Hitler been a weekend Nation to his will using nothing but raw Charisma all that from a man

191
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
Who only made Corporal a man whom Art School wouldn't Dane to let in his

192
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,071
My appeared after he hit his 30s

193
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
Not so with your brother Johan he was a leader of men even as a mere boy

194
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
Charisma of Messianic proportions but even Jesus Christ

195
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,271
Christ had help consider the three Magi and John the Baptist who heralded the savior's arrival into the world

196
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,671
How they ready the way for his glory likewise the four of us have been keeping track of your hands

197
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:11,071
Once ever since he was a little boy exciting wouldn't you say what is it that you want with me

198
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,471
Please accept our Hospitality until Johan comes looking for you at the very least

199
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,359
Actually I'm afraid I must insist you know too much for us to let you walk away now

200
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
Don't worry about that I came here of my own volition I will wait here for you hun

201
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
Then we agree

202
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,927
Now then you should at least try the fruit

203
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,983
Good you're finally awake

204
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,079
Don't look so worried we're not going to hurt you

205
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
That's right away at least

206
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,967
So what brings you to my little slice of the world

207
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,575
Doctor Tenma wait how do you already know what my name is

208
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
Why don't you leave the questions to me

209
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
Now all you have to do is answer

210
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,535
Why exactly were you snooping around

211
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
I know you're looking for Johan but I can't figure out why where are you keeping Nina

212
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,007
I told you to leave the questions to me did I not

213
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:27,359
What are you going to do with her

214
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
Nina is our guest whereas you are just a metal some piece of trash to be disposed of

215
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Is she okay

216
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
At the moment

217
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
But that'll change soon enough

218
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,767
She's determined to kill your heart and we simply can't have that

219
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,607
Always ashamed when a pretty girl dies before her time

220
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,191
You're just using Nina as bait to throw out Johann

221
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
What are you planning on doing who the hell are you people

222
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
The whole quarter indeed

223
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
The night sky tomorrow will be a thing of beauty of fiery cleansing

224
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
If I stay here

225
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
Then I'll find you on

226
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,295
Please help

227
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
Who are you

228
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
Where are you right now

229
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,448
It sounds like you're speaking with an accent

230
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
Where are you from

231
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,200
Have you been taking prisoner by the people here

232
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,528
Help me please I can't

233
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,856
They're watching me closely I've got to stay in here

234
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Let me escape

235
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
I have to warn the other so my baby will die too

236
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,912
Tomorrow night we celebrate in honor of johann's homecoming

237
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
Only the members of the pure Master race like us deserve to survive everything

238
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,968
And she'll just burn away
