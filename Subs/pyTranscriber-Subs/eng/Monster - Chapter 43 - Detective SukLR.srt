Three men detective you can start looking for any evidence up here before we start taking any action should

We wait for detective crotchi to arrive I mean I'm taking charge here start looking for Witnesses

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,608

Is crime scenes go this one is pretty brutal

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
Inspector Zema

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
So bad we can't even make out his facial features face is completely unrecogniz

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
I guess it's good he had his police ID with him otherwise we wouldn't have been able to figure out who he was

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
The bodies of two other men are over there we haven't been able to figure out who

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
They are one took a gunshot to the Head the other was beaten to death like the inspector

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064

Stinks

18
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,728
They make fun of me just because I'm a rookie the other police guys all look at me like I'm crazy when I give them an order

19
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
You have to work to earn their respect before the listen to you he's right I'm a detective yeah

20
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Rookie Det

21
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
And when you got to the crime scene you took one look and lost your lunch

22
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,184
Just because you grew up liking cop TV shows doesn't mean you can do the job

23
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,024
John you always got carried away even when we were back in college

24
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120

00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,752
He always treated me like I was his own son

27
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,080
When I started I didn't know anything

28
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
But inspectors him on was there for me

29
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,712
Batman taught me what it takes to be a real Detective

30
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,088
I respected him you know for caring enough to help out a guy like me you needed a hand

31
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:15,232
I will avenge his senseless death if it's the last thing I do

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143

Her friend here is feeling pretty depressed any chance you could talk to him for a bit something terrible happened to the superior

He's all broken up oh yeah he's been pretty depressed come on I haven't acted depressed at all

61
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:37,055
I never met a person as kind as he was inspector's name on was an inspiration to me

62
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
And his murderer took that great man away from us I know I'll find a way to bring him to just

63
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Oh wow

64
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Here I am doing all the Talking sorry

65
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:54,719
You're passionate about what you believe you've got to try your best to catch his killer

66
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:00,607
Oh I can't believe this I finally get the chance to talk to you and I haven't even asked you about yourself yet

67
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
So I what's your name

68
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519

00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
But I don't what well maybe I can help you yeah I'll figure out who you are I think

70
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
People is part of my job maybe I can guess your name

71
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
After all I am a detective now I'm betting your name is I told you I don't even know my name

72
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
So there's no way you can guess it

73
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,047
I'll tell you two things I know about myself

74
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
Chaddock Bridge

75
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
And three frogs

76
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,263
And that's all I know

77
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,895
Wait a second when can I see what did we tell you

78
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,967
You blow it next time try picking one that's not so pretty

79
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:55,647
All right we've identified the two men murdered at the same time as Inspector zamon

80
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
Victim number one is just mere

81
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,279
This other guy is yakovsuit

82
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,631
Turns out they were both sergeants in the secret police

83
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,751
After the fall of socialism they went underground and started getting up to all sorts of no good

84
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,079
After analyzing blood of the crime scene we found something

85
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:19,455
Besides them on Murat and sewageek we all need someone else's blood at the murder scene

86
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
Someone with blood type A B r h positive

87
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,111
Judging from the amount of blood we found we know they were seriously in

88
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,951
At present we're trying to actively determine that person's identity

89
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Detective soak

90
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
Soup wake

91
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,863
Yes sir what on Earth were you just daydreaming about

92
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:43,263
We have lost a billion officer inspector Simon we're facing a dire situation and your daydreaming here

93
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
I'm very sorry sir

94
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Anyhow

95
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:55,039
According to a witness there was a man seen walking away from the murder scene at a time we feel was immediately after the crime

96
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
Is described as a tall thin man in his 40s carrying a large duffel bag looking like a tourist

97
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,303
No I want all of you to get out there and track that guy down

98
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Oh well

99
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
That girl

100
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Guess she won't be back

101
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Mr Detective

102
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
Did you find your friends killer

103
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
Have any luck

104
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Not yet

105
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
It takes time

106
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
But I did get more information that might help

107
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
The inspector

108
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
He was

109
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,815
Investigating a murder case just before he died

110
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Tell me more

111
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
This Old Man

112
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
He was running his own illegal orphanage

113
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
Somebody shot both him and his maid

114
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
All morning

115
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,127
Zayman was busy questioning the man who discovered that crime scene

116
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
Who was he

117
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
You know

118
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Who was the man who found the bodies

119
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
We seem nice

120
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
He was a tall skinny looking guy

121
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
He was visiting from out of town

122
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
Yeah this big heavy duffel bag

123
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
Tough and man

124
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,863
And he was carrying a big duffel bag

125
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Could it be

126
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
That man being questioned do you know where he is

127
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Yeah

128
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
I think I do know I'll call the station and check

129
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
Come on pick up

130
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,063

I need to find those three frogs

136
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
That they are

137
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
If I come here I bet I'll see her again

138
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
He checked out

139
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,687
See the Grimmer Mr Grimmer

140
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,527
Ah it says here Mr Grimmer checked out the day before yesterday in the morning

141
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
There's no dou

142
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
I know exactly who murdered the inspector

143
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
It was Grimmer he slept here in this room

144
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Damn

145
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
Why couldn't I have figured this whole thing out two days ago

146
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
Don't worry inspector

147
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
I'll still catch that bastard

148
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
I swear

149
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Hey

150
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,871
My word detective soup what are you doing here

151
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,687
Chief detective patella I could ask you the same sir

152
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
I see

153
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,879
Ah using your witch you progress this far all by yourself that's impressive

154
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Thank you

155
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
Answer

156
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
I knew I'd be the first

157
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,303
To make a breakthrough in this case I just knew I would

158
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,399
And I won't stop doing all I can to make sure that cop killer is apprehended

159
00:12:54,655 --> 00:13:00,799
Yeah you really pulled things together here great job thanks Chief now I'm ordering you to do me a favor here

160
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
Here and keep this whole thing top secret

161
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
Huh

162
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:10,783
But Grimmer killed them all the clues lead to that conclusion we can't just let him just hold on Detective

163
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,367
This case is a little more complicated than you think it is what

164
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,719
Inspector zaimon had been assigned to a special investigation

165
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
It was top secret

166
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Wait the inspector

167
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
Was working Undercover

168
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:31,007
Right he was investigating former Czechoslovakian secret police agents some of them had faked their records and we're working

169
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
His officers on the Prague police force

170
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,151
Inspector zaymon was working with members of the check secret police

171
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
You know those two corpses we found with zaymon

172
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,807
Both of them were formally checked secret police

173
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
And aside from myself and the chief

174
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
Almost no one knows about this

175
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,255
Don't stick your nose In Too Deep you could get yourself killed

176
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167

Yes sir

218
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,783
Don't say a word to the chief about our tall thin suspect

219
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Right

220
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Poor zemon

221
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
What a way to go

222
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
Looks like his desk is pretty much been cleaned out

223
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,375
All that's left are these two boxes of his personal stuff see to it that is Widow gets it

224
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
Looks like a key for a gym locker

225
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
God that smells

226
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,751
Nothing in here but sweaty shirts stinky socks and moldy towels

227
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
A notebook

228
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
What the heck is this

229
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
Stop detailed Personnel files

230
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,183
Of everyone that's on the force oh wow

231
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
It's even got my whole record in here

232
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,423
Inspector zaiman had been assigned to a special investigation it was top secret

233
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,823
Right he was investigating former Czechoslovakian secret police agents some of them had faked their records and were working as

234
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
Officers on the Prague police force

235
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
There's something missing

236
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
Two files aren't in here

237
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,927
Chief detective patellas and detective Yeti checks

238
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:55,359
You're right Detective

239
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,759
This is a suspiciously large amount of cash that's why I brought it here chief

240
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:07,647
So tell me soak I want to hear some eyes about inspector same on from these things that you found

241
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:14,047
Closer it appears that inspector zaymon was conducting an internal investigation

242
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,447
And as a result he discovered the detectives patella and janicek worked previously in the

243
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,847
Old regime has agents for the Czechoslovakian secret police I think

244
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:33,247
And it makes me sad to say this sir the inspector must have taken all that cash is hush money

245
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,647
In return for keeping quiet about the truth

246
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:46,047
The implications of this evidence are serious I know

247
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:52,447
I feel sick to saying it detective soak yes sir

248
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,847
I need to keep this matter completely to yourself we'll talk again later

249
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:05,247
Return to your regular duties yes sir

250
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
I never

251
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,743
Thought this would happen yeah things have become complicated

252
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
We were playing stupid to do what we did

253
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,607
Why we take a guy like soup so light

254
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,703
And we haven't even settled the matter with this guy glimmer that killed Zam

255
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,031
And now there's an even bigger issue that we have to face

256
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:33,919
So then do we offer the rookie money like we did with zaymon if that doesn't work the only option is

257
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
You know

258
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
Whatever it takes

259
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,599
I don't want any trouble for allowing former secret police into the force

260
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,183
From here on we've got to keep a tighter lid on all of this

261
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,279
Want six gone things will be as smooth as silk

262
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,375
My head I sure could go for a nice drink right about now

263
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,191
How about a whiskey Bonbon instead

264
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Hey there better than nothing

265
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,127
Besides these were a gift from a real Beauty here

266
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Chief

267
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
What's wrong

268
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
You look depressed

269
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,960
I feel like I can't believe in anything anymore why

270
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,776
I'll help you if you want me to

271
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:36,640
I believed in him I never would have thought that inspector zaiman

272
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:43,808
What happened I believed in him

273
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:05,056
Right now the only person who I really believe in

274
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
Is
