The key

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,168
The

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,472
And the secret code number

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,264
Therefore my

00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
Deposit box

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,872
With the experiment data and tape can be found

8
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
What

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,944
Oven interview

10
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,992
With a certain boy

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,064
That boy is the malevolent monster

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,624
That led 511 Kinder

13
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:32,000
To destruction

14
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,256
Well here's his office

15
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,912
Inspector Simon I brought the witness

16
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
Inspector

17
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Sure

18
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,296
This man was the first to arrive at the pedrov murder scene yesterday

19
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:36,672
Mr Grimmer sorry about having to keep you here at the station overnight

20
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,536
I slipped and dropped my nail clipper under my desk

21
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,144
Yeah when you're a guy my size seems like you're bump into everything

22
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,496
Hey you're a pretty tall guy yourself yeah

23
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,056
My find eye bump into a lot of things as well

24
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,384
Anyway I'm in charge of this murder case my name is Damon

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Hi I'm Grimmer

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
All right please have a

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,600
I was just in the middle of clipping my nails so I hope you don't mind me finishing them

28
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Go right ahead

29
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
My wife's always nagging me about it

30
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
If my nails start to grow out

31
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,072
Nah she really doesn't like that at all

32
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
She can't stand seeing the white part

33
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
So thanks to her sometimes I wind up cutting them too short

34
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Oh nice

35
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
Well that must have been a terrible scene yesterday

36
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Yeah

37
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,408
I mean I would have thought something like that would happen

38
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,736
I understand you're a freelance newspaper journalist

39
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
That right

40
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,088
I imagine you might have known about the murder victims past

41
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
Michael Ivanovic Pedro

42
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
That's him

43
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
His real name was Reinhardt beer

44
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
He was in East German

45
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,912
After Germany's reunification he was accused of various illegal activities

46
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
Including suppression of Human Rights

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Illegal Detention of minors

48
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,800
And several charges of extreme child abuse

49
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,872
He escaped here to the Czech Republic right after the wall fell

50
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,224
The German government maintained the charges against them

51
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:09,344
We chose not to extradite him allow them to be free and kept him under surveillance

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Is that

53
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Indeed

54
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,512
We kept an eye on him and found he was associating with some former secret police types

55
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
Why the check secret police

56
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:24,447
You know how brutal their tactics were when it came to restricting free speech and thought during the Cold War don't you

57
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,871
Well they also gave their support to the terrorist activities of some extreme leftist organizations be that

58
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
To me though

59
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
With the peaceful separation

60
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,575
Subsequent democratization of the Czech Republic and Slovakia they went underground without being noticed

61
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
Without causing any trouble

62
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,207
That's who pedroth was in contact with before he died

63
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,327
We think he was probably selling them information he had

64
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
What we have yet to ascertain

65
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Look at that

66
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Cut it too short again

67
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
Oh yeah

68
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
Did you happen to see a woman leaving the crime scene

69
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Excuse me

70
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,319
It appears as a fairly good chance that pedross murderer was a woman

71
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
And allegedly

72
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
She's quite beautiful

73
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,463
Right as we got to pedrov's the boys said they saw a woman leaving

74
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Not the time

75
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
I guess I didn't notice

76
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
That's too bad

77
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
What about the children

78
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:31,263
What's going to happen now to all those orphan boys that Mr pedrov adopted I'm curious

79
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,871
Child Services told us to keep all of them overnight right here at the station but as of today

80
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
Most of them are going to be sent out to different local orphanages

81
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,223
Huh

82
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
I see

83
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,087
It must be terrible for you getting dragged right into the middle of this huge mess

84
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
It's fine

85
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
Come to think of it

86
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
What exactly was your purpose in trying to contact pedrov

87
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,631
I wanted to ask him questions about his past you know the kind of stuff you were mentioning earlier

88
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
Well how did things go did he tell you anything

89
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
No

90
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,799
Before we could talk

91
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
They look great my wife can't get mad at me now

92
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,831
You can go now Mr Grimmer and again I apologize for keeping you here so long

93
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
No problem

94
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
I almost forgot

95
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,839
Free died Mr pedrov happened to say anything to you by any chance

96
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Anything at all

97
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
No

98
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
All right your meal

99
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039

Hansa Antonin Izzy this must be sad for

105
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:28,255
I mean you boys got along so well and now you're being pulled apart

106
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,863
But even when you're apart you're all still under the same sky

107
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
And someday you'll all play soccer together again just stay positive you three

108

You're the group's leader aren't you

110
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
Keep everyone in touch by writing letters to them if you do that it'll keep all of you feeling good

111
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,855
Had a boy Antonin

112
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:39,167

The best in the prime minister of Arizona

120
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
Hey mister

121
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,103
You could have at least warned me you were going to pick up other fares

122
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,687
Giver television of the

123
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Hello

124
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
What's the name is

125
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,911
Oh wait what's going on you're driving us way outside of town

126
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,311
Look I just want to go back to my hotel in the city

127
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
The key the key

128
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:02,111
What what are you talking about

129
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
Food stamp of thirsty

130
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,711
Well

131
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Are you all right

132
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:08,415
You know I had a hunch it might be in danger so I decided I better follow you you heard much you look

133
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,815
Pretty rough

134
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,679
Those two were probably Hooligans from the former Czech secret police

135
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,495
Do you have any idea what they might have wanted from you

136
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
No not really

137
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,639
Well I can't imagine them doing something like this without having a good reason

138
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
They had no reason to do this

139
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Are you sure

140
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
You're not trying to hide something here

141
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
No

142
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
I find that rather hard to believe

143
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
You got to know why they did

144
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
No I'm telling you I don't

145
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
Sorry you've already taken it from the safety deposit box at the bank

146
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
The tape

147
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
The audio tape

148
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:02,687
My friends

149
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
We are looking for his roots

150
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
Who's Roots what do you mean we're searching for the monsters

151
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
Roots they're going to sell for quite a lot monster will know a lot more when we get to

152
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
Tape we'll know precisely we're in the Czech Republic the monster's mother is living now right

153
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
Oh hello

154
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
This is inspector's am

155
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
That man who got caught robbing the supermark

156
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
Did he say he was partner

157
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Well that's great

158
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
Good work detective suit

159
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Mommy

160
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
I still have something I have to attend to

161
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
Yeah

162
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
I'll be back at the station in about an hour

163
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
I'll see you

164
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,991
Guys I think that's probably enough or you won't be able to talk

165
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
So grammar

166
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Now do you feel like talking

167
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
Where's the key huh

168
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,215
Look I don't know what this key is that you keep talking about

169
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,031
Wait let me reason with him

170
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
Mr Crim

171
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
It's really pointless of you to try to hide it from

172
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
That safety deposit box keep heads off

173
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Where

174
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Like I said

175
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Before I can't tell you what I don't know

176
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
I got you you want money don't you

177
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
Well then let's make a deal here

178
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
How much are we talking about

179
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:01,215
Nothing I may be a hack journalist but at least I make enough at it to keep myself fed

180
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
Mr Grimmer

181
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
What a mess

182
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
This is just not right

183
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,527
You know my wife would say your nails are in desperate need of a trim

184
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:20,927
I told you how she likes them didn't I

185
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
Why'd you do that you should have moved

186
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
Now let's try again

187
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,407
So where is it

188
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
Where's the key

189
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783
I asked where

190
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
Even if you did visit that bank and you're able to open the sleeping deposit box with the key and you got

191
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,255
Tape and the data it wouldn't be of use to me

192
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
Who possesses that tape is of a claim importance to the organization they're trying to do something

193
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,751
They're going to restore the Eastern block to its former glory

194
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:13,151
The exact identity of the monster is recorded on that tape of pedross

195
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,223
And they need to know everything about that monster

196
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,671
That monster is like a king that monster can unite them all

197
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,511
All of those orphans from 511 kinderheim

198
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:34,911
Yes those children were selected to be

199
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,799
I mean this is the highest order the 511 kinderheim group was the most elite group that East Germany had

200
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
And the monster can summon all of them to do his bidding it's been said that he was able to control all of the

201
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
Working as a 511 kinderheim and that he was the one who had it destroyed in the end

202
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
He's a real monster and the only person who could unite that Elite group

203
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:05,631
All right now where's the key

204
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:12,031
I think they're an elite group

205
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
Why the hell are you laughing

206
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:31,231
What do you want is it money you're after I get I'm a capitalist hey I love having lots

207
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
The money

208
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:38,399
I'm not taking sides I just want to sell them pedross tape so they give me a load of cash what's your angle on this

209
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
Is this all for social justice

210
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,103
There's no reason for you to go this far for that just who are you really

211
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,015
You say you're a journalist from the Old Eastern block but most of those folks were agents

212
00:16:54,271 --> 00:17:00,415
Government intelligence in fact the very best of those agents were spies who was it that

213
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
What you think you're a super spy

214
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:13,215
Sure

215
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,295
You're going to die if you don't talk

216
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,391
Okay this is your last chance where's the key

217
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
You ever hear

218
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,255
Of a magnificent Steiner

219
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
The cartoon

220
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,959
On TV in West Germany in the 1960s

221
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
The signal is so strong

222
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
You could even watch in East Berlin

223
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
I mean character

224
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
And select weakling

225
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
But when you get into a really dangerous fix

226
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,111
The secret friend is would come and save him

227
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:09,535
And beat his enemies to appalled however the main

228
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,679
He always blacked out before he arrived

229
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,775
One day he realized his special friend

230
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:26,175
Awesome self and whenever he got into a situation that was truly

231
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:32,575
You would somehow transform into the terrifying magnificent Steiner

232
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:38,975
Came to he'd find all the evil doers bleeding At His Feet his transformation made him Unstoppable

233
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:45,375
Well you better trans

234
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,703
Gone transform right now

235
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
Pour some water on them

236
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
He'll tell us about it soon

237
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,847
It's only a matter of time

238
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
And who are you

239
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
What

240
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
A woman came in

241
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:37,408
A woman

242
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,808
Amen then I heard a single gunshot

243
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
And one of those men was shot in the head but on the other

244
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,424
Another two bodies there weren't any bullet holes

245
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
The Magnificent Ste

246
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,512
I did it again
