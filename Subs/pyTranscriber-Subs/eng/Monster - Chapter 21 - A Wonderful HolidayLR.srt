7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,904
Leaving B Barbara Rome wasn't built in a day you know

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,512
It's the same deal with my new antique business rough start then smooth sailing

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,352
Well for me everything is really happened so quickly

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,424
I suddenly get to live in this gorgeous house

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,752
And I have a wonderful and caring husband

12
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,544
Who makes me great cocktails

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
Hey honey

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
Did you see something just then

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,576
There in the window

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,880
I get this feeling sometimes

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,928
Like we're being watched

18
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:05,280
What honey that house has been empty for a while yeah I know

19
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
It's OD

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,656
Actually I talked to Mrs Daughtry from across the street

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,960
What about she said

22
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,752
The 20 years ago

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,312
A couple was brutally murdered in that house

24
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,664
Anyone who moves in never stays for long they say the place is haunted

25
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040
Michael dear what's the matter

26
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,648
Wait a minute now don't tell me that you believe in ghosts too do you darling

27
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,976
Of course not what do you take me for

28
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
Are you going out sir yeah

29
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
I'll get the car

30
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
Not this time

31
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,240
I thought it might be a nice change of pace to go out just the three of us

32
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
Don't worry no one's going to try anything

33
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
I get it

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,968
Unless I'm mistaken you're wanting a little father son time with the boy you're a smart body guard you know that

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Best of luck to you Daddy

36
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
Have a good time

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
All right off we go

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
So Detective

39
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Why don't you dig up

40
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
Regarding Dr Tenma

41
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,768
Everything checked out exactly as you told me

42
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:50,144
He's the main suspect in the murder of the Fortuner couple but the police have no idea where he is at the moment

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
Here's a transcript of 10 statement

44
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
He made it back during that first question

45
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,896
He operated on a boy at Eisler Memorial Hospital 10 years ago saved his life

46
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,480
Kid went on to kill the hospital director and two other doctors

47
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
The boy's name was joh

48
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,856
He was already a young man the next time 10 men encountered him

49
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,928
Turns out Johann executed a patient in his care

50
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,768
Next up Nina Fortuner

51
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
She was the murdered couples foster daughter

52
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
No one seen her since the night they were killed either

53
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
Messner was a tougher nut to crack

54
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
But I did finally track him down in Frankfurt

55
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
Well then what did you find

56
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
The grave with his name on it

57
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,247
Turns out he was stabbed to death about 2 months ago

58
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,855
The official police version is that he was on the wrong side of a drug deal gone bad

59
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,999
Back when I was a detective on the force Messner was my partner

60
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
Sorry for your

61
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,935
They caught Messner with confiscated narcotics and booted him off the force

62
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
After that he got some help from a man called the baby

63
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
Bring any bells

64
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,871
He's the spokesman for some nationalist group in Frankfort

65
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
How is this relevant

66
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:10,015
You remember hearing those news reports about how it's Turkish quarter almost burned down last

67
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Right

68
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
Word on the street is the whole thing was the babies brainchild

69
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,439
And the Turks credit an Asian stranger with having saved their neighborhood

70
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,023
Turns out that stranger's name was Tenma

71
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
What are the odds

72
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
I'm thinking it was the doctor

73
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,751
And what's more people are saying the baby had those fires set to commemorate the introduction of a new leader into their

74
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,359
Group some Wonder can they were all really excited about he was going to change everything

75
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Who is this guy

76
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
I've already told you

77
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
What was the name of that boy Dr Tana saved a decade ago

78
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Johan

79
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:52,255
Well that young man who was supposed to take the reins of the babies organization in Frankfort

80
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
He was Yohan too

81
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
You should have seen that one coming

82
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Call me crazy Robert

83
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
But I feel like one of the ponds on this chess

84
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Waiting for the

85
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Oh goodness

86
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,655
What's going you looking so pensive all of a sudden

87
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
Thinking about the past

88
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,519
Everything was going straight to hell for me at the time

89
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
But after that phone call it change was like night and day

90
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,687
Back then my partner Messner and I were selling drugs

91
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,503
Whatever we confiscated off of the dealers we busted

92
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,343
The voice in the other end knew everything

93
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
He said it would be our little secret

94
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,999
If we did him a favor kill some couple in Heidelberg

95
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
The fortuners

96
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
And I didn't know him from Adam

97
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
But there was another guy there that night a

98
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Paper reporter or something

99
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,871
We killed all three of them no choice

100
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:51,039
After that somebody wired money to the both of us when I left the police force The Syndicate was

101
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
Just waiting with a great offer

102
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:58,719
They gave me a plum job and the pay was top-notch I had everything I wanted out of life or so I thought

103
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
That's when you met your wife and decided to go straight or so I would wager yeah but I still

104
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
Can't figure out why they let me just walk away

105
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Who was it

106
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:15,359
Who called me that day I got to know who transferred all that money over to us who the hell is manip

107
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,455
Letting my life oh damn it

108
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Robert

109
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
I want to be sure that you know

110
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
I really appreciate your help

111
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Well if that's how you feel

00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183

00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Were there any calls from the detective

00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431

00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
The kindest couple I'll ever know

153
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335

My mom and dad were Angels they were Angels I'm sorry

Barbara

160
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,799
Trying for your family about mine

161
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
So this is what it feels like

162
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
Right before somebody kills you

163
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,391
Fritz he called me Daddy today

For the first time don't take that from me please please let me live

165
00:13:54,303 --> 00:14:00,447
I finally found someone worth living for Barbara

166
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,847
Been friends I met them at half past 8:00 in the morning

167
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
Cafe in dusseltorf

168
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,199
I quit the force and joined the syndicate

169
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,271
My boss told me to act like a businessman

170
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,671
Made for a nice cover every morning this woman and her little boy would walk by

171
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,279
They were my daily reminder of the regular honest life I've given up

172
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
Hey so how you doing

173
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
I'm fine thanks for asking

174
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
Tell me something what did you hire that detective for

175
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,151
I was hoping he could find you in 10

176
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
And my former partner

177
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
I wanted to know what he was up to

178
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
Messenger's dead

179
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
Whatever it's worth

180
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Stabbed to

181
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,255
When I heard about that I asked the detective to find out more information last night I got a phone call from him

182
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
I've been digging around

183
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
What do you mean strange

184
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Here it is

185
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
The draft of the report

186
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Mrs Keller

187
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
Roberto

188
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Look at this

189
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
Do you know what this means

190
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Yes hello

191
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Hey

192
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
I need that bag

193
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Robert

194
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,967
Your wife and Fritz are already home

195
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
What are you saying

196
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,623
If you hurt them I might be hurrying right back

197
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
A lot of accidents happen at home

198
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Give me a gun

199
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
Look there's something I got to do

200
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Remember

201
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,759
That model is intended for close range work

202
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,087
Only got four shots so make them count don't worry about me

203
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,159
I was an officer Once Upon a Time

204
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,023
Can have me dying before you take me to the police and have me confess to killing your parents

205
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
That's right

206
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
So don't even think of dying on me

207
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
I'll cover you from the empty house next door good luck

208
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,879

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
