1
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,504
Hello

2
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,808
The wind's getting cold isn't it

3
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,952
That's strange she always smiles at me and says hello

4
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
Oh Ann

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,144
Are you headed home for the evening

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,072
Hey Nina

7
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,240
Looks like all the restaurants in this neighborhood are already closed

8
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
Let's go back to the hotel Nina

9
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
What's wrong huh

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
For some reason people on the street

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
Talk to me like you know me but they called me

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,256
Instead of Nina

13
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
Interesting so what's wrong with this

14
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
This picture

15
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,728
I'd say a lot Sook is the main suspect in a Multiple homicide case I don't see any police

16
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,080
Security anywhere yeah I'm going to go in there and take a look around

17
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:31,200
Sure well I think I'd better tag along I could use some answers myself

18
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
It's quite as a tomb and there's not

19
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
Excuse me there's an injured man being Hospital

20
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
Nice to your soup is his last name Young souk he's a police detective

21
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
All these men were injured at this vacant building on Bruno Street

22
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
Unemployed men who knows what story they're report

23
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
On the news but what you're saying is probably the real deal so could you please tell us what rooms they're staying

24
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
After their serious injuries were treated they were all moved to another hospital

25
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
Where I don't know it says a large ambulance came and loaded up all six of the patients

26
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Those goons attacked us there were six of them what about soup detective Yonce where's he he's the one that was

27
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
According to our records there weren't any patients brought in with any gunshot wounds wait is there

28
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
For any record of a patient with the name yansuk even being brought in here no not at all

29
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,279
You have researched data in an audio tape from 511 kinderheim

30
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
I do

31
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
The former director of 511 kinder

32
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,935
A man named pedrov gave them to me before he died

33
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
He was running this illegal orphanage in Prague

34
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,823
Those things you have how exactly would be interested in them

35
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
I don't know for sure but I've got a hunch

36
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,527
I'd say the check secret police have a keen interest in obtaining any material from 511 kinderheim

37
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599
That said where are you keeping this data in the tape

38
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
Well they're not on me

39
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,183
I've stored them in a secure location

40
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,511
Suk was shot because you possessed something they want

41
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
Probably led to him being kidnapped from here what's just as bad as we can only imagine what they'll do to soak to force

42
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
That data on tape from my hands

43
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
God what a mess

44
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
The contents of the tape in the data

45
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
What are we talking about here

46
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
The research data was a list of technical terms

47
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
It also contained a list of names

48
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
I didn't have the time to examine it closely

49
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
I only listen to part of the tape

50
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
So what was this tape recording of

51
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
A child talking

52
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
A child

53
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
This young boy was probably drugged

54
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
And the interviewer asked him questions

55
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,983
And when this boy was asked his name his answer was Johann

56
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
Doctor Tenma is something the matter

57
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
511 kinderheim

58
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,247
Search data Johanna

59
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,879
Where is that tape right now

60
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
It might be best if you come with me

61
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
Tell us where soup is

62
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
We can discuss that after our business

63
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
Where is suke

64
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,959
With the both of you come with me please

65
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:40,383
Doctor Tenma you really should have stayed behind there's no point you

66
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,783
You getting involved in this any further no I also have a couple questions that the check secret police

67
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,183
Might be able to answer for me so you're saying you have your own agenda

68
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Well the first question that needs answering here is whether we can negotiate with these people

69
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,399
People at all

70
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Hold on

71
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,711
You didn't drive us all this way to treat us to dinner did you

72
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
Welcome gentlemen

73
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
Come have a seat

74
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
I know that face

75
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
He looks familiar

76
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,327
He must be a high-ranking member of the Czech secret police you're right

77
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
He's Captain Carl lunker

78
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
I did research on him at the newspaper

79
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
Now we're getting somewhere

80
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,359
First I want to express you my sincerest apology for what

81
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,967
The men I assigned to this have taken actions that were far too heavy-handed

82
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,575
This was an error within our chain of command we've been awfully misunderstood

83
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
Are you and the world

84
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,207
We are viewed as a road gang of Ruthless killers

85
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
So where's Suk

86
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
Suke is not in any danger

87
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
He's resting comfortably at one of our hospitals

88
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
This isn't just a misunderstanding

89
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:12,799
I don't want you thinking of us as thugs after all it's not like we've killed anyone what about the woman

90
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,919
What woman wasn't that blonde woman who killed pedrov acting on direct orders from you

91
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,831
I've heard about This Woman's murderous activities but she isn't working for us in fact she's been quite disruptive

92
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,159
To our plans we are not in the business of killing people

93
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,535
A German associate of ours informed us that he wanted the tape and the data

94
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
And we were delicately negotiating securing them from pedroth in the middle of all this he was murdered

95
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
Well there must have been a lot of money involved

96
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
Yes but that negotiation failed

97
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,127
We are here to discuss business of a more pressing nature

98
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,015
I want that tape and data in trade for the safe return of Sook sounds fair but I don't have those things

99
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,087
I was supposed to say you do have what we want

100
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
I can't allow it

101
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
I won't

102
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,143
Who knows what could happen if that information got out into the world for a second time

103
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,983
We must never allow something like that to happen again

104
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,055
There's no point in talking about things like that now

105
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,639
After all it doesn't really relate to our present discussion

106
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
That's where you're wrong

107
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
You see I'm from there

108
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
I was there

109
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,879
As a child I was sent to live at 511 kinderheim

110
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
I see

111
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,559
How old are you

112
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,399
Well when did you leave that place

113
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
I was 14 years old as near as I can tell

114
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
And I was 30 years ago

115
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
When were you there

116
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Who knows

117
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,967
Guess I got there when I was about 8:00 so that must have been around 1963

118
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
I guess

119
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,367
Did you know this boy

120
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:12,607
He's my nephew in the early 1960s I was officially stationed as an intelligence off

121
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Chinese Berlin

122
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:20,031
Where I worked as a spy for the Czechoslovakian Embassy I had a beautiful younger sister she married

123
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
This is German after being married a few years my younger sister and her husband plotted to defect and

124
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Across the Berlin Wall

125
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,551
During their attempt to cross over they were shot dead

126
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:37,951
My nephew was all that was left of their family I heard it was a wonderful place so I signed him up to

127
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Live there

128
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
It was touted as an ideal environment to prepare and educate children with dubious past so they would qualify

129
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,959
Fine to become the Communist Elite of the future

130
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
I gave it my all I used all the influence I had to be sure that he would get into 511

131
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,711
Kinderheim I don't know him

132
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,599
I have no memories none from that time

133
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Or even before then

134
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,767
I don't remember what happened there I was brainwashed I can't even tell you my real name

135
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
I see you're trying to make a profit off of something that was reprehensible

136
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
You want to sell information that includes experimental data that was collected from your own nephew

137
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
We've strayed off topic

138
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
You're attacking instead of discussing things

139
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
In a calm business like man

140
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Very well then

141
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
You may go

142
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
We're done discussing things for today

143
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,191
I await your acceptance of my offer

144
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
Take these gentlemen where they wish

145
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
I can't believe he sent us a way

146
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
What do we do

147
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,223
Saving soup is what's important

148
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,831
If we give him what he wants I think he'd release suit to us right away

149
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Are you okay

150
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
Hot

151
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
I remember

152
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
I remember

153
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,575
Once a week we got Coco he always look forward to drinking it

154
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
Your nephew was so kind to me when I got a fever and slept in the infirmary he brought me his

155
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
He gave me his

156
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
I know he liked it so much

157
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Delicious

158
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,567
Never had cocoa that delicious in my entire life and I wanted to thank him in some way for what he'd done for me

159
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
And that's what he said to me

160
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
That's when he looked into my eyes and said Remember Me

161
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,551
Back then while we were there we all did stuff like that

162
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
We talked about ourselves to the friends we made

163
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
I don't really know why

164
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
But our memories about ourselves would fade day by day after those strange lessons they would put us through we could

165
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
That's why

166
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
That's why we had our friends remember who we really were the boy who helped me

167
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
Hot cocoa drawing pictures and bugs fascinated him but he didn't like bug collections because he didn't like having to kill the

168
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
Box the most funny ever had was spending a day in the forest with his parents he caught a lot of butterflies there

169
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,023
And when he went back home he said the butterflies free his life long dream was to be coming into demologist his name was

170
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
His name was

171
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,031
His name was Adolf Reinhardt

172
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:12,735
That boy

173
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:18,623
Was my nephew

174
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:38,591
Keeping secrets from him is definitely a no no

175
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:51,647
People can become whatever they want to be

176
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
But toast

177
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
Hey welcome home hey welcome home hey welcome home

178
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
Hey Nina what's wrong

179
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,503
Somehow I I know this place

180
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
The Brick Road leading up to here

181
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,695
The scenery is familiar and even

182
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
This old sign

183
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
I know all these things

184
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
You lived here

185
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
I don't know

186
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
But what

187
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
I'm afraid

188
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
So do you know this store

189
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
Not sure

190
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
Could I Hold On

191
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:58,207
I'm so afraid

192
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,359
I also recognize these stairs

193
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
I couldn't sleep not after what you said

194
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
I thought about it all night

195
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
What doctor

196
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,863
That research data and tape really shouldn't concern you actually they do looks like we're not going to have time to talk

197
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,191
I guess they're ready to do some more negotiating

198
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
Are checked secret police have dropped by for a morning chat

199
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
I guess they won't answer

200
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,711
So have you had a chance to think everything through

201
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
I have

202
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,063
And I don't plan on giving you the research data or the tape

203
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:05,023
So you're saying that you don't care what happens to detective Sook if something happens to Sook

204
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,863
That precious data and tape disappear from this world forever I guarantee

205
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
Your attitude keeps us from making progress

206
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Hold on

207
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,799
I am willing to offer you a chance to listen to the

208
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:25,759
The only condition I have is that you forget this whole business about getting your hands on it and selling it to that German friend of yours

209
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,343
I'm fine with meeting you somewhere and letting you hear the tape in private

210
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
If you want to listen to it by yourself

211
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
I think

212
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
But you should want to listen to it

213
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,583
I think you should hear it for your nephew who lived in 511 kinderheim

214
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:44,447
You should listen closely to what exactly that boy Johan said on your precious tape

215
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
So that's the deal you're willing to make

216
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,335
I didn't say anything about making a deal that's enough

217
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
We don't have time to be going on and on like this

218
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:59,807
As we sit here discussing the finer points of some deal and innocent person could be killed because of that tape

219
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,463
Tell me how many people that were somehow involved with the Czechoslovakian secret police have been killed because of that connection

220
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
And just who do you think killed them

221
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
Any idea

222
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
I know exactly who this Relentless killer is

223
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,959
It's a person who wants to take more than anyone

224
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
It's Johan

225
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,311
What are you trying to say

226
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,431
I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about don't you play dumb with me

227
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,783
Your German friend who wants you to track it down should have told you what kind of tape it is

228
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
So what is he hoping you're going to find

229
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
The monsters identity

230
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
That was all

231
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
I didn't want to get you involved

232
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,375
But now I'll tell you everything

233
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,703
Before anyone else is murdered over this

234
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,479
I see

235
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,879
So this killer Johan has come to Prague searching for his Origins to uncover his past

236
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
Could be

237
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,999
Yohan could be here trying to erase this past completely

238
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,351
You created this mess what the hell did you do 15 years ago

239
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
Back then a mother and her daughter lived in Makowski near cheddock bridge and then one day both of them were taken away by

240
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,663
Secret police when your thugs took Johann from the building with a sign that has three frogs what did you do to him

241
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,759
He stairs

242
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,463
Are you okay Nina

243
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,791
He was taking and drive down these very steps

244
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:52,191
You took him away who was my big brother

245
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,567
During that time I was indeed in a position where I could get any of the information I wanted

246
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
But the three frogs building

247
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,663
Grabbing a mother and a child

248
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
I don't recall any of that

249
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
Don't give me that

250
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:12,159
As high ranking as I was there was some things even I didn't know about like the things that man did

251
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,743
We didn't even know which branch of the secret police he belonged to

252
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,351
Why we couldn't even figure out whose chain of command he was supposedly following

253
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:27,007
He was given free reign entertained as many people as he cared to for no real reason and never had to report it

254
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,591
We all Wonder to ourselves how can you do that

255
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,503
He was only the rank of Captain but unbelievably his office was somehow headquartered in a luxurious man

256
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
Yes

257
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,391
He was called the man of red rose Mansion I believe

258
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,207
Are you saying that this Captain was involved

259
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,559
He was a very elegant quiet man who kept to himself

260
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,399
He never wore a uniform and he loved having tea and cake

261
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:59,263
What was his real name it was Franz bonaparta

262
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
I see

263
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,151
Bonaparta however I'm not certain if that was his actual name

264
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,223
Bonaparta was also known to have a pseudonym

265
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,623
Why would he need one well you see he was also the author of a children's book

266
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,976
Are you afraid of the store

267
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
I was reading a picture book in here

268
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:33,056
In the door opened someone came back home

269
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
Children's

270
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:45,856
F*** that's right it was a strange picture book it was called the nameless monster

271
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
There's nothing in here Nina

272
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
This memory is real I've been here before I was

273
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:05,056
A picture book sitting here by myself the one who opened the door and came back

274
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:11,456
What's me

275
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
How could that be

276
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
I was greeting myself

277
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
Welcome home
