00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
But the person I'm looking for

17
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
I'm not going to find them here after all

18
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,712
And we were just getting to be friends too sorry your twins right

19
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016

00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
What's this picture book

22
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,744
Cuz this is what he was looking at when he started screaming

23
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
Once Upon a Time

24
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
In a land far away

25
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
A nameless monster

26
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
The monster

27
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
Was dying

28
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
To have a name

29
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
So the monster made up his mind

30
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,512
And set out on a journey to look for one

31
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,607
But the world was such a very large place

32
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
The monster split in 2

33
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
And went on separate Journeys

34
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
One went East

35
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
The other

36
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
Headed west

37
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
The one who went East

38
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
Came Upon a village

39
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
There was a blacksm

40
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
He lived at The Villages entrance

41
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Mr blacksmith

42
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
Please give me your name set the monster

43
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,535
I can't give you my name reply the blacksmith

44
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
If you give me your name

45
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,423
I'll go inside you and make you strong set the monster

46
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
Really

47
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Set the blacksmith

48
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
If you make me stronger I'll give you my name

49
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
The monster

50
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Went into the blacksm

51
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
And so

52
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
The monster became

53
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
Auto the blacksmith

54
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Auto

55
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
What's the strongest man in town

56
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
But then one day he said

57
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Look at me

58
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Look at me

59
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
The monster inside of me

60
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
He's getting bigger

61
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
Munch munch

62
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Chomp

63
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
Gobble gobble

64
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
The hungry monster

65
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
Ate a bottle from the inside out

66
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
Once again

67
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
He was a monster

68
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
Without a name

69
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,767
Next he went into Hans the Shoemaker

70
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
However

71
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
Munch munch

72
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
Chomp

73
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
Gobble gobble

74
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,567
Once again he went back to being a monster without a name

75
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,127
Then he became Thomas the Hunter

76
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
But soon

77
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
Munch munch

78
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
Chomp

79
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,015
Gobble gobble

80
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
Golf

81
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,647
Becky went to being a monster without a name

82
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,255
The monster next went to a castle to look for a nice name

83
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,007
He Came Upon a very sick boy who lived in that castle

84
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,407
If you give me your name I'll make you strong send the monster

85
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
The boy replied

86
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,015
If you can make me healthy and strong I will give you my name

87
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,415
So the monster jumped right into the boy

88
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,767
And the boy became full of vigor

89
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,327
The King was overjoyed

90
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
He announced

91
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
The prince is healthy

92
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
Prince is strong the monster became quite fond of the boy's name he was

93
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
So

94
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,895
Please with his Royal life in the castle

95
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:19,295
So he controlled himself no matter how ravenous his appetite became day after day despite

96
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,695
Is growing hunger the monster stayed put inside the boy but finally the hunger just be

97
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
I'm too great

98
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
Look at me

99
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
Look at me said the boy

100
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,887
The monster inside of me has gotten this big

101
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
The boy devoured the king

102
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,543
All his servants

103
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,895
Munch munch

104
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
Chomp ch

105
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
Gobble gobble

106
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,415
The castle was lonely now with everyone gone

107
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
So the boy left

108
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
On a journey

109
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,375
He walked and walked for days

110
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,407
And then one day the boy came upon the monster who had gone west

111
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
I have a name that the boy and it's such a wonderful one at that but

112
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,463
The monster who went West replied who needs a name I'm perfectly happy without one

113
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,863
After all that's what we are nameless monsters

114
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:43,263
The boy ate up the monster who went West

115
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
At last he had found a name but there was no longer anyone to call and buy it

116
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,503
Such a shame because Johan

117
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,063
Was such a wonderful name

118
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
You've read this before

119
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Haven't you

120
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
So you can recheck

121
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
Are you tickles Slovakian

122
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
I'm not sure

123
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
Wait how come you don't know for sure

124
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
I was very young

125
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
Three or four

126
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
I think somebody read this story to me back then

127
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
Who are you really

128
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,303
I mean could it be possible that you aren't actually Nina Fortner at all

129
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
And if that's not who you are

130
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
Then who in the hell are you

131
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
I don't know

132
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,943
What do you mean you don't know we're talking about you

133
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
So you're the one who should know right

134
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
Tell me what's going on here

135
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
I need some answers

136
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
Why did I get such a bad feeling when I read this picture book

137
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
What does that mean Nina

138
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,303
Student name foreign who claim to be shoe bald son committed suicide

139
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,887
The detective that you both hired fell off a building and died

140
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,471
Margo Langer was shot to death

141
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
After reading this book

142
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Why is it now suddenly occurring to me

143
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,919
These three horrible events are somehow linked

144
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,527
And I'm getting a weird feeling that everything is somehow connected with y'all

145
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Sorry I overre

146
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535

00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
The one who collapsed after he saw the book

148
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
Does he really look identical to

149
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
Is he my mirror IM

150
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,639
I'm talking about your friend you know Johan

151
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
You think he looks like my twin is that right

152
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
Where is Johan right now

153
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,695
He's at the University Library attending the book donation ceremony

154
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031

Stand

200
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,951
How could you even consider this

201
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,839
Now don't spoil the fun

202
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631

207
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
It is extremely important

208
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
That you do not

209
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
As you all may know I am blind

210
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:06,463
So I am unable to tell how many people have gathered together in this room tonight

211
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,071
You need to leave the library this instant

212
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
That's right

213
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
Just stay down there and be a good boy

214
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,039
It's a real shame you won't be able to watch me do this

215
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:47,167
Get away from here go

216
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Right now

217
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,751
Single file and don't push

218
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:49,887
Google Google

219
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
So how come there's a fire

220
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,887
I get it

221
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:34,687
Still running around like ants bumping into each other trying to get out just like that

222
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,087
Amazing you're amazing your heart

223
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:47,487
Amazing

224
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:00,287
It's pretty

225
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:19,488
Everyone is running and falling over each other without

226
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:25,888
Or anyone but can you sense it in the room

227
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:32,288
The fear

228
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
You won't be able to

229
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
To do it I have to shoot you I'm sure you can't but I have to kill you

230
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,888
You're a doctor of medicine and you've dedicated your career to saving life

231
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
Taking life is my job and I do it well

232
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:10,688
Give it up you can't do it
