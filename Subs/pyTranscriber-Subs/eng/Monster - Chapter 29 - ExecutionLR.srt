00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,968
Rainbow Ranger J

2
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
Hey that's not fair you're supposed to fall when I kick you

3
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,328
My evil empire is going to take over the world you're puny little kick isn't enough to stop me

4
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
The bad guys always losing the TV show don't you know anything hahaha well well

5
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
How's the global domination coming along

6
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:53,760
The big secret to breaking the rules is to make it look as though you're following them

7
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,576
So what sort of plans do you have for the Earth

8
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,976
Who knows why should I care I'm just going to destroy everything anyway

9
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
A lot more fun than being a stupid hero yeah forget being a rainbow refilling

10
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
Well guys shall we start making our way back

11
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
Okay come on so did you have fun today

12
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
Time to go home

13
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,192
Finally starting to warm up a bit

14
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
That's good

15
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
I guess

16
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
Has Rosemary

17
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
You know

18
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Not a one

19
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,944
Too busy romping around with her friends to get sick

20
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,528
That's good she used to get those fevers like clockwork

21
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
Hey remember that one time years ago rushing her to the doctor and the dead of night

22
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,280
Those old pictures

23
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
You always keep them on you

24
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
Of course I do I bet she's a lot bigger now they grow up so fast these photos of mine

25
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
The ancient history

26
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
But still

27
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:02,688
No matter how grown up she gets I'll always know it's her the moment I'll rise mate She'll always be my

28
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:10,624
Oh almost forgot whenever she's ready please give Rosemary what's in the sandal up

29
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,488
The newspaper clippings mostly and the official Internal Affairs report

30
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815
From when I shot that young man who killed all those people

31
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
I'm not asking you to defend me

32
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Done that enough

33
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
I shouldn't have shot him

34
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
And I'll be the first to say it

35
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:37,759
I just want our daughter to know to know the truth about her old man even if it's terrible

36
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
I understand

37
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,303
She said either way

38
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,143
I'll ask her again if she wants to see you

39
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,263
If she's okay with it then so am I really oh thank you

40
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,663
Just give me a call at the latest time usually home by 9:00

41
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
To see the old you again

42
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
That look in your eyes they Shone like that when you first made detective remember that fire

43
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
Are you heading your belly when you and I first met

44
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
We both had

45
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
So what do you think

46
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,239
If you enroll today we can get you in at a lower premium

47
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
The thing of it is we already have insurance

48
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
We don't really need another policy

49
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,407
Let me just show you our rates Mr Liebert that's all I ask

50
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,223
The coverage we have right now is more than enough

51
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,807
I couldn't afford a whole new policy at the moment anyway

52
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:50,207
We've had our current one for 4 years ever since we moved into this neighborhood 4 years huh where were you

53
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Anything before

54
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
Well over near Manheim in Boone

55
00:05:54,047 --> 00:06:00,191
Bruton how about that it's a nice area so are you folks from their originally yeah we are

56
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Nice is an understatement

57
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,567
So do you folks have any kids

58
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,223
He's attending the University of Munich here as it turns out we're offering a new plan

59
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,295
Perfect for young adults hear me out this won't take a minute

60
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
Oh your son I presume

61
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
Well he sure was a handsome baby

62
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
What's his name

63
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,791
His name is Johan would you like some tea

64
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
Yeah don't go to any trouble on my account

65
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
They must keep him pretty busy at school

66
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:37,311
Seems like he hasn't called us in a long time boys get like that when they leave the nest sounds like you speak from exper

67
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
Experience

68
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
Hello Dr rifine

69
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
I'm back

70
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
Yeah I went to Johan's folks house

71
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
That's the

72
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Thing

73
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
They were normal as could be

74
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Totally average

75
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
So what do you make

76
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Richard

77
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:10,335
Hello back in my detective days I probably would have said there's nothing fishy or than normalcy

78
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Or something to that effect

79
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
Now I just don't know

80
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,015
At any rain I'm going to keep checking out the people around you hun

81
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
Where's the flaw

82
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
Nobody's that perfect

83
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
You won't enjoyed a great reputation during his prep school days is grades were Top Notch and is evaluations

84
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
Game is a model student

85
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
But still no matter how grown up she gets I'll always know it's

86
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,311
You're the moment I'll rise mate She'll always be my little girl

87
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,487
The baby's face in the photo there's no way he grew up to look like you're on

88
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,095
Here you go sir the birth certificate you asked about

89
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Thank you

90
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
Johann Wilhelm Liebert

91
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Date of birth

92
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,359
9th of February 1976

93
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:52,223
So it was definitely born in this town

94
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,807
Everything here reads pretty legit

95
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
Mr Hertz how many times do I have to tell you you cannot

96
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
Not light up in here just give me an ashtray I promise I'll smoke it real quick no way and risk another fire like

97
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,215
4 years ago I am not replacing all those damn files again mister

98
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:20,383
You had to recreate your files from scratch we

99
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
We got all our ducks in a row again eventually

100
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Hey

101
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
Thank you so much for coming Dr Gillen

102
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
Good to see you again

103
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
It's been too long Dr reichv

104
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:53,407
So I'm to understand that when Dr tenmark came to see you he was looking for a young man he called Johan

105
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,991
That's right but there was no evidence with which to corroborate his story

106
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,111
However if the young man in this photo is the friend who manipulated my current research subject

107
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,951
When Peter Jurgens a serial killer into committing another murder

108
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,791
Then Clues must exist that tie these three events together

109
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
I'm counting on you Dr Gill

110
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Right

111
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,191
I'll get clearance to interview Jurgens as soon as possible

112
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847
I'll let him see this Photograph and monitor any reactions if it might help prove 10 minutes innocence it's worth

113
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Try

114
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,047
So he's dead

115
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
That's right

116
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,399
The real Johan Liebert who was born in Boone town

117
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
Died when he was 2 years old

118
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Hold on

119
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:27,871
You're saying the liebert's replaced their dead sun with someone else and after that fire destroyed the original records

120
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,991
I use that chance to plug the other boy into that identity I'm afraid so if they did

121
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,343
Then who's this young man masquerading is Johan Liebert alive and well

122
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
Beneath the

123
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Who the hell is he

124
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
At any rate

125
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,839
I did pass along Johan's photograph to Dr Gillen when he stopped in to see me

126
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,935
Hopefully he'll get to interview that killer of his again sometime soon

127
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Now then

128
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
How about dinner

129
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
Sorry but it's getting late

130
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
Another time what's this

131
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,919
You run around all day and now you're working through the night as well hardly

132
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
I'm expecting a very important phone call

133
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
Cross your fingers

134
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
There's a chance I may get to see Rosemary

135
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Really

136
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Don't worry I'm okay

137
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,231
You're always telling me to focus on the road ahead aren't you

138
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Of course

139
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
This is an important step in your recovery

140
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
Yes hello

141
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Hi

142
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
It's

143
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Hi Rosemary

144
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Yeah Daddy's fine

145
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Of course

146
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
I'd love to see you

147
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
You say when

148
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
And I'll be there

149
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Mr Brown

150
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
It's Johan

151
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
Tell me you're against this young man

152
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Do you recognize him

153
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
Maybe you've met him somewhere before

154
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
I don't know him

155
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
Best friend of yours

156
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Johan right

157
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,423
You only know him through his letters you've never actually met him isn't that correct

158
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,799
But Johan certainly seem to know a lot about you

159
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,175
Could I borrow your PIN for a moment

160
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
What's that

161
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,295
I'm sorry you know the rules here prohibit me from giving you anything

162
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
Give me your PIN

163
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
The park

164
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
That's where I was

165
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
Killed someone the day before

166
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,223
I remember thinking I'm going to stop killing people

167
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
I've had enough of office

168
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
That's what I told myself

169
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
He was there

170
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
With a bunch of kids

171
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583

We met at Mr schewald's estate remember

176
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
Johan Liebert sir

177
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,959
I've been trying to get in touch with you but to no avail so

178
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
I figured I'd drop by

179
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
Yes

180
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
Oh Dr Gillen it's you good

181
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,111
So did anything interesting happen when you showed Jurgens that photograph of Johan

182
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
Wait he's dead

183
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Correct

184
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
I'm at the hospital right now

185
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
The police still aren't done questioning me

186
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
So I'm stuck

187
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,263
Listen we lost a vital witness tonight because I was careless and handed a psychopath of ballpoint pen

188
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
But I do know one thing for sure

189
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
Jergens committed suicide

190
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,175
Because he saw that photograph of Johan

191
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
I'll be over there as soon as I finished up

192
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Police all right

193
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
All right

194
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,367
I'll give Richard a call and let him know

195
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
He'd better be home

196
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
A report for class huh

197
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
That's right

198
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
On the recent un convention on the rights of the child

199
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
And if the treatment of juvenile offenders holds up

200
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,039
Oh how rude of me care for something to drink no thanks I'm fine

201
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,367
That's right you do abstain from alcohol

202
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Yeah

203
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Probably for the best

204
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
You did have quite a drinking problem

205
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,327
I mean you were drunk when you shot that boy isn't that right

206
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
So I've heard

207
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
Yes I was

208
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
Not that it matters

209
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,359
What I did is unforgivable drunk or not I have a few questions about what happened if you don't mind

210
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
Tell me about the victim

211
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
Stefanios age 17

212
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
Of what crimes did the child been accused

213
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
Don't be so naive son

214
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
Yours was a monster

215
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,511
He was old enough to rape and murder nine women and almost killed two more

216
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
So you executed

217
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
No I didn't

218
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
Pardon me

219
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
Speaking of

220
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
Article 40 of the UN convention

221
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,567
States every child is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty according to the law

222
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Were you familiar with that

223
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,527
Yes of course I was I used to work in juvenile detention and article 37

224
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:32,927
The one that goes you cannot impose capital punishment or life imprisonment without possibility of release on any person

225
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,231
Symbol of the age of 18 you know that one

226
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,607
The convention Agreements are considered basic human rights for adults and children alike

227
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:47,007
What kind of a fool do you take me for you really think I planned it all out in advance my shooting him was a drunken mistake

228
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,335
Look I know that what I have done can never be undone all right

229
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,687
And I accept the consequences of my actions

230
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,551
I'm not trying to antagonize you I just want to cover my topic from every angle

231
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,647
I'm very sorry sir I really should have used more tact

232
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,719
Shall we walk the night air might do us some good

233
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
I'd like to purchase the bottle please

234
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
Just something to take the edge off of the night air

235
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
Oh Dr Gillen

236
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
I keep calling him but there's no answer

237
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,615
You know Richard did say he might be getting to see Rosemary soon

238
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,687
But this hardly seems the hour for a father-daughter reunion

239
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,551
Well when you finally do get a hold of him let him know how dangerous that young man can be

240
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,647
And tell him that I'm in route to his apartment

241
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,231
Did you ever look into Stephanie's background

242
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
Of course he grew up in an East German orphanage or something like that there's more to it than you

243
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,727
His crimes were to be expected

244
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
If you knew his past

245
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
To a child like Stefan

246
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
That orphanage was hell on Earth

247
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
He was a good boy

248
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,295
But that didn't save him from the horror that might have even made it worse

249
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,599
That orphanage devoured his mind

250
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,903
And then picked its teeth with his soul

251
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,535
The convention on the rights of children article 6 the right to life survival and development

252
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
Article 8 preservation of identity Article 19 protection from abuse to Stefan the

253
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,495
So many fairy tales Eva

254
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,103
There's no more fitting word for a place like that I can barely speak its name aloud

255
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,199
511 kinderheim steel sends a chill down my spine

256
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,039
So when will you be seeing your daughter

257
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
What did you say

258
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
How do you know about her

259
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,463
Before you answer the door you were on the phone with her

260
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
Isn't that so

261
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
When do you see her

262
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Tomorrow maybe

263
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Enough talk

264
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
What are you up to

265
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
I'm just doing research for my report

266
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
That's all no damn it

267
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:05,247
I'm on to you kid you're going to tell me what you've got planned for shoe Vogue

268
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
So who are you

269
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,623
Who are you

270
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
Tell me

271
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,423
You got drunk and shot that boy to death that's

272
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,823
Plenty of people did see you drinking in a bar that day

273
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,639
But that was after you'd already killed Stephen

274
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,735
It's kind of odd Mr Brown

275
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:43,647
I've researched this case exhaustively and try as I might I can't find a single person who saw you drinking before

276
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:50,047
You murdered that young man not a one Mr Brown this charade has gone on long enough

277
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,863
Will you really drunk when you pulled the trigger

278
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,935
You are quite sober

279
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:02,335
And you are calm you executed stephanieos and you knew exactly

280
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:08,735
Did I get it right

281
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,343
I'll wake the mind when it wants to forget

282
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:20,000
Maybe you didn't forget maybe you're lying is it a lie you tell everyone around you

283
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,400
To lie you tell yourself were you absolutely certain he committed those crimes certain

284
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800
To put him down like a rabbit dog you're guilty of murder do you think

285
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:45,600
Bad Boy's blood is on your hands how are you going to look Rosemary in the eye tomorrow

286
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:52,000
Isn't her daddy a coward and a murderer hiding behind an empty bottle

287
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
Well Richard

288
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
How about a drink

289
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
Huh

290
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,296
Dr Gillen is that you

291
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
We're the police

292
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,672
We've come here regarding your patient Richard Brown

293
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
He's dead
