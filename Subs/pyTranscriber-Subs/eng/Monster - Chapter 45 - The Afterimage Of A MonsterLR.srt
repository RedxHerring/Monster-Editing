1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,632
This is the most scandalous case that has ever occurred in the history of the Czech police force

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:12,288
Much to our dismay we discovered that the three officers who were murdered were connected to the former Czechoslovakian secret police

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:18,688
In light of these incidents I would like to believe that all the dark connections which have stained our reputation have been purged from the

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,456
Rock station

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:25,600
Remember you are proud officers of this Force I expect conscientious behavior from all of you

6
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,672
And let me say this

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:35,072
That's your new Chief I intend to carry out a very thorough reform here and my first order of business is to regain our

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
Citizens Trust

9
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:41,728
I will now introduce you to the five members special investigative task force which was sent over here from the government

10
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:48,128
It goes without saying that I expect you to cooperate with them so we may close the book on this atrocious case as soon as possible

11
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
Possible

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Your detective so

13
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
Correct

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Yes

15
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,808
As your new Chief I would like to say thanks

16
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,392
For the fine investigative work that you've done on this case to help bring it to light

17
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
You're very welcome sir

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,280
Oh and by the way detective what case are you currently working on

19
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:09,376
The one inspector zemon was on which involves the murder of pedrov

20
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,936
A man who was operating an illegal orphanage

21
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,216
Very well then

22
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,544
Please continue to devote all your efforts to solving it Detective

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
Yes sir

24
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
I'll be on my way then

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
One more thing

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,272
That tall man who emerged as a suspect and inspector zaymon's murder

27
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,880
Do you have any pertinent details on him that you can give me before you get back to work

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
No sir

29
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't have any solid information on him as of yet

30
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:42,912
I see you may go now thank you good

31
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
Sir

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
Young souk

33
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
He's been assigned to this division for a year now same on took him under his wing early on and they became

34
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
Soup uncovered detective patella and Janet checks hidden past he also met

35
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
Chief Hamrick right before he died I want you to keep an eye on that kid

36
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,312
Yes sir

37
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
Hey

38
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
You know when I called up that hotel where you told me to be staying and I was kind of surprised to hear you you answered the phone

39
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Not that I'm complaining

40
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,399
Well it sounds as though you thought you were going to be deceived again

41
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
Maybe

42
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
Orange juice please

43
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,711
Mr Grimmer I know you wanted to meet me some place where there were large crowds

44
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,039
But is the spot really okay what do you mean by okay

45
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,159
I spoke to the new chief he hasn't taken you off the suspect list for zaymon's murder yet

46
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,767
Besides you're being pursued by former members of the Czechoslovakian secret police

47
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:54,143
Come to think of it you might be right about the crowd maybe it makes you safer

48
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
There's no such thing as a safe place

49
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,359
If they're fixing to do it they can get me any place anytime for example

50
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,687
They can take me out from that window with the red drapes

51
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,559
Look Mr Grimmer I want you to level with me okay who are you really

52
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,959
Just a struggling freelance journalist but if that's true then why put yourself through all this guess

53
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,311
I'm just nosy seems to come with a territory how can you make light of it

54
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,943
At every moment your life isn't danger don't worry about me

55
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,551
It was my decision to get involved I knew it was risky

56
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,927
Suk is currently in a cafe in Republic Square

57
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
And he's not alone

58
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
He's meeting with the suspect now

59
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
It's all rather lanky fellow

60
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
There's no doubt in my mind that it's Grimmer

61
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Yes

62
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,751
Should we continue to observe them for a bit longer sir

63
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,335
All of the started when you went to see Petrov

64
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
This was a man who conducted brainwashing experiments on orphaned children in East Germany back before the unification right

65
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:19,135
Right and then before he died I drive gave you the key to his bank safety deposit box where he kept a record of those

66
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,951
Same experiments is that right yeah

67
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,047
And he also mentioned something about the monster's past

68
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:32,447
I wonder what he could have meant by that it seems that there are many people who for whatever reason want to get their hands on that

69
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
Data

70
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,871
You mean the former secret police and also that lovely blonde lady

71
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
The children at pedrov's orphanage also mentioned her called her the pretty blonde lady and I said they saw her leaving

72
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
Leaving the house right after pedrock was mortally wounded

73
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,743
Do you have any ideas who that woman might be

74
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
I don't have a clue she's a mystery to me

75
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:16,479
Is it all right you're being here like this I mean we haven't told your superiors about this meeting

76
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
We're here acting on your own aren't you

77
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:25,439
That's not exactly what I'd call being an honest team player look I'm not planning to hide any of this from them

78
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839
The moment I'm exercising my own discretion I'll report to my superiors after I've gathered out evidence in this case

79
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,959
And if I do a thorough investigation I can prove to them without a doubt that you're innocent

80
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
It is something the matter

81
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
Looks slowly to your 9:00

82
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,223
That's suspicious looking fellow sitting under the umbrella reading a newspaper

83
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
What do you think

84
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Couldn't say

85
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Now then

86
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,631
Shall we go all right but where do we go

87
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,495
You brought it with you didn't you you know the key to the safety deposit box that I gave you

88
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
Yeah

89
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
Don't you want to find out

90
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
The identity of this so-called monster

91
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
Yes

92
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,367
In that case we better get going though knowing who it is might be hazardous

93
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
Your health

94
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,791
You're looking a little pale soup

95
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:47,615

96
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,431
Hey what's wrong

97
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
Nothing

98
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:02,207
Must have imagined it soup is on the Move I'm on them

99
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647

I will take you to the vault

105
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,591
This is where we have our safety deposit boxes

106
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
You may use that room to view the contents

107
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
Research papers

108
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055

109
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639

I do have a tape recorder with me

111
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
If you're ready to hear it

00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
And I'm going to press play now

00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703

Once Upon a Time

130
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
In a land far away

131
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
There left

132
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,863
A nameless monster

133
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
The monster

134
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
Was dying to have a

135
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
Is that a story that you've read before

136
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,847
I was waiting for Ann

137
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
Who is Anna

138
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,503
I was reading a picture book while I was waiting for Ann

139
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
This boy was drug Suk

140
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,879
They gave him something before this session was put on tape

141
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Who is your father

142
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
I don't know

143
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
Your mother

144
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
I think she's alive

145
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
You

146
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
You're a very bright child

147
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
Is there anything you're afraid of

148
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
What is it that you are most afraid of

149
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
Let me ask a different question then

150
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Have you ever killed anyone

151
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Many people were dead

152
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
It was like

153
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:20,767
Anna and I were the only two people in the world

154
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,375
Let's go back to that other question again

155
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,543
What is it that you are the most afraid of me

156
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943

00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
It's

160
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,127
I'm going to throw up

161
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
What happened Mr grim

162
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
Hey are you all right

163
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
What did we just hear on this tape

164
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,647
I mean was that little boy the voice of the monster

165
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
I really don't understand what's going on

166
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,351
Even though we don't know what this tape is about

167
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
There are people out there who would do anything

168
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
To have in her possession

169
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,615
For one the former Czechoslovakian secret police under them it won't make any difference if we just listen to part of the tape

170
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
Are all the way to the end

171
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,991
I'm sorry to tell you but there's no turning back

172
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:52,671
What are you going to do now do you

173
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
Time to return the tape and the research papers to the safety deposit box

174
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
No under normal circumstances they should be stored here as evidence but all things considered

175
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
You're planning to hang on to them then I think we should leave separately

176
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,271
Let me serve as your Decor after all it's me they're watching

177
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
Oh yeah better give me your telephone number and street address if we're both able to make it home safely

178
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
