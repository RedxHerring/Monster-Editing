1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,864
And you haven't touched a drink since is that correct

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,680
Absolutely not even a drop

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,080
Well that's very good but you have to continue to stay away from booze to give yourself the chance to start over there's

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:18,688
Don't worry I'm going to drink as long as I report to you once a week I don't want to incur your Wrath

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,528
Hey I just the thought of it makes me afraid what are you talking about

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,416
I always conduct myself in a very calm professional manner I was kidding I don't have time to drink anyway

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,256
I got my first big case since becoming a private investigator

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,304
Well that's very good news

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,584
Dr rifine

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,376
How would you judge this fellow

11
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,656
What do you mean

12
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:45,312
But using your knowledge of physiotomy I thought maybe you could tell me what kind of young man appears in this Photograph I

13
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,848
Don't practice physiotomy

14
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,712
Richard I'm afraid you're mistaking me for some kind of quack fortune teller a weirdo psychic

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,016
But you have a well acknowledged reputation

16
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,368
You're able to predict someone's behavioral traits from just a single glance right

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,976
That's the result of many years of accumulating information from observing patients

18
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:08,096
Then can you use all of those years of acquired wisdom to tell me if this guy looks like a con man

19
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
Con man

20
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
That's not possible

21
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
A man with a face like his couldn't fool anyone

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,848
Even if you tried some kind of con he'd be easily found out

23
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,872
Ah

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
What are the odds that he commit suicide

25
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
Absolutely none at all

26
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,064
People with faces like his would never kill themselves

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,160
Well I must say doctor your observation seem to be pretty convincing

28
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
Then give me quite a lot to think about

29
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,256
And they're based on experience

30
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:40,864
So who hired you if you don't mind my asking Hans gay Yorkshire

31
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
You're working for shoe Vault I take it you know who he is am I right yes I'm quite familiar

32
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,664
You with him he's the wealthy vampire of Bavaria wow that immensely Rich gentleman is my client

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
And the young man in the photograph is Edmund fahren

34
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
And in person it who actually passed himself off as shoe Volt's son for a while you event

35
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:08,000
He gave himself away not really Mr Shoe volt bought every detail of his deception

36
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,584
It wasn't your typical run of the mill scam artist you know

37
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:18,240
I myself had a lot of trouble figuring out it was a complete fraud even though some pieces of the mystery

38
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
But I'm still remain how did foreign know so much about shoe Vault missing son where do you get the information and

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,504
The only way is to go straight to the source and demand that foreign tell you

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
Yep

41
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,344
Normally I would but the boy committed suicide

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
They say

43
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
Come on now Martin think of it as a

44
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
For an old friend at least let me take a look at the suicide note huh the handwriting's been analyzed

45
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:21,119
How to doubt the kid wrote it himself okay look you're an outsider now Richard I can't justify bending the rules

46
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
The two kids who found the body Carl Neumann and load of Frank

47
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,287
Didn't they work at the same part time job as I've been far

48
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:33,407
They were just friends that's all well maybe they weren't such good friends

49
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
So how you doing anyway is it the same old grind yeah you know how it is we never have enough personnel

50
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:45,183
In fact I've had no time to rest since I took over your position so thanks a bunch Richard

51
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,535
Slowpoke Martin has become one of the big shots now

52
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
You don't get to call me that anymore

53
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
When you have my boss anymore so I don't have to put up with your wisecracks oh come on Martin you just don't get it to you

54
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,567
You have no idea how much trouble you put us through

55
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,431
We spent countless hours hunting down that serial killer and had him in our sight

56
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
But you were drunk as hell and killed him

57
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,807
Believe me it was no picnic cleaning up your mess

58
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,719
Now if you'll excuse me I haven't got time to waste on simple suic

59
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,559
I'm a very busy investigator with important criminal cases

60
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,423
I want to check out the crime scene

61
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
I presume everything's been preserved right

62
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:35,103
I already gave the go ahead to have it cleared out since it's been determined that there was no crime

63
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,687
They'll be removing all of the deceased effects sometime today

64
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
Damn it when did Slowpoke Martin become so efficient

65
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,887
They're supposed to be arriving anytime now to take everything away don't worry I won't be more than a couple of minutes

66
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,359
Most of hung is real from this pipe in the ceiling

67
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:14,015
It appears that he wrote a suicide note of this desk

68
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,087
Here's a paper he was in the middle of writing

69
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,927
The birth of tragedy process and reality

70
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
World Views on psychology far for the course for a philosophy student

71
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,983
These must be the materials he was using for his paper

72
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:40,127
Caesar's gallic Wars now what was he doing with this book seems out of place

73
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
Spanish or it could be Latin I can't read a word of it

74
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
This is the only passage underlined in the book

75
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
That seems OD

76
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
Up here it is room 204

77
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,303
YouTube better go down and get a bunch of boxes

78
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
Okay

79
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Start with the books

80
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,519
It's going to take a while don't work too hard guys hey what should we do with this desk

81
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
Let's just leave it there all right

82
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Yeah

83
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,111
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your former neighbor

84
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:28,511
I have nothing more to say just leave me alone hold on I'm not with the local police I'm a private investigator I don't

85
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
Who you are Mister you're bothering me and I have a paper due tomorrow but I haven't been able to get it finished because of all the questioning and Comm

86
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
Ocean going on next door all right I'll be quick

87
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Just one question then

88
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,103
Would you happen to know if these two were close friends of Edmond foreign

89
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,759
Couldn't say I'm too busy to hang out watching everybody around here but as far as I know that guy didn't seem to have

90
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:56,159
Any friends I ever saw really I've said enough go away hold on a second just one more little thing

91
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
Ah come on now what could you translate this passage for me the part that's underlined in red ink

92
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,191
This is just ridiculous it's going to be your fault if I flunked my class

93
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,263
Can't believe I'm doing this for you I appreciate it

94
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,639
It says I can no longer continue

95
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
To deceive

96
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,111
What was the last thing you said I don't know now if you don't mind I'm busy okay

97
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
So I can know

98
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
Longer continue to deceive

99
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,047
Where have I heard that before

100
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
You like coming here too

101
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
Hey

102
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,559
We met a few days ago Johan right why don't you come all the way up

103
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
You can get a much better view if you're standing up here at the very top

104
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Right

105
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,175
Hey thanks for the hand

106
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,599
Oh man kind of scary up here huh

107
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
It's not scary at all

108
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,839
Johan come down from there

109
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Come on stop it

110
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,703
I'm serious you're going to fall

111
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
Do you come up here a lot

112
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Yeah

113
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,967
Around this time the lights start coming on and the neighborhood looks beautiful

114
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
Family members are returning home

115
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,391
And the delicious smells of dinner begin filling the air

116
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
It's something I've wanted for

117
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
A long time

118
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Really

119
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Yeah

120
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,863
I guess because I never really had anything like that when I was growing up

121
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
So tell me what's your family like

122
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Got

123
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
Not something you want to talk about

124
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
Wish I could say the same

125
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,503
Being bounced from one foster home to another made it important if you don't mind

126
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
I'd like to hear your story

127
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
Tell me everything you remember

128
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,815
This is just sloppy police work

129
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:48,703
I can no longer continue to deceive and those words are supposed to be proof he was writing a suicide note

130
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
That wasn't a suicide note

131
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,383
Lauren was just working on translating a Latin phrase from this book

132
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,575
So anyway that's my story

133
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
I wish it worked so depressing but it's all true

134
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
It's very strange but I feel like I can talk to you about almost anything in the world tell

135
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Tell me one with thing

136
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
That rich father of yours

137
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
Are you talking about shuvald

138
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,023
Those tears in your eyes are you

139
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
Crying for me

140
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Listen

141
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
You've got to do something Carl

142
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
I'm there every day tending to housekeeping chores

143
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,407
And I see changes in him that really have me worried

144
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,271
Ever since Edmund committed suicide Mr shoebald hasn't been eating very much

145
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,391
If he continues to starve himself he's going to end up dying too

146
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:17,279
Carl why don't you try telling him that you're his real son what have you got to lose

147
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,631
I want him to get to know me first and then maybe shoot all will grow to like me

148
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:26,239
If I tell him the truth now he won't believe it because he just doesn't trust me yet

149
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
He could completely reject me and think that the only reason I'm coming forward is because I'm after his money

150
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
Seems like money means everything to him

151
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
That's all he knows

152
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,575
So how can he understand how I feel

153
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
Well we can't just do nothing your father is in a deep depression and we have to come up with a way to get him out of it

154
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
I see you're worried about him

155
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
But don't know what to do

156
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
I have an idea that I think might work

157
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
I can no longer continue to deceive

158
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,807
Edmund wrote these words but they weren't meant to be a suicide note

159
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
In his dorm room I found this Latin book

160
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:21,791
Caesar's gallic Wars and he was working on translating this underlined portion from it which means his death might

161
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Might not have been a suicide

162
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,959
I don't have conclusive proof it's just my gut feeling based on many years of police detective work

163
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
Have you been listening to a word I said

164
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Anything at all

165
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
No

166
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
Not really

167
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Why

168
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
It doesn't matter now

169
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,255
Don't say that it does matter you have to believe me

170
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:57,887
If I'm right that Edmund didn't commit suicide there's a possibility that your life's in danger

171
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
That dear lad

172
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,103
He was my son and I can't bring him back nothing matters

173
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:12,735
I've already told you the facts everything about him including his birth was completely unrelated to you

174
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,599
He was a fake a con I'll Grant you he wasn't a very good con

175
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,927
Apparently he didn't make it a habit of fool people but

176
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,767
That's precisely what he did to you Mr shoeval he just saved you

177
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:31,423
I must ask you to leave now Mr schewold is tired and needs to rest

178
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,775
I'm not going to let this investigation end yet

179
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,639
And my decision has nothing to do with this being my first high profile Pi job

180
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,551
I can feel it there is a far greater evil lurking somewhere behind this case

181
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
Sometimes in life

182
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
Even if we want to

183
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,559
There are things we can't do over and we can't ever make right

184
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:08,031
They're gone can't you understand that yes

185
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Yes I understand

186
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
Only too well

187
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
This isn't over yet

188
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
Good day to you sir

189
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,135
A children's rights treaty

190
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
Yes

191
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
I guess you could think of it as an international rights agreement to secure and protect the civil liberties of children in countries

192
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
All around the world

193
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
That's what I'm currently working on in my Law class anyway

194
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:42,079
But my volunteer job with the orphanage is completely unrelated to that project I do this because I know I can help make

195
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
Difference in their lives

196
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
Hey guys

197
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,711
Can we get back to what we were discussing earlier

198
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,783
You said you've all went bankrupt three times in the past

199
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Yes

200
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
After each one of them

201
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,159
He would just disappear

202
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
And when he'd reappear he'd start from scratch

203
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,047
And work to regain his fortune

204
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:08,959
Mr scheuval told me during one of our Friday reading sessions how this experience re-energized him

205
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
Gave him new Strength

206
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,823
Well did you ask him where he went when he disappeared each time

207
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Yes

208
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,431
I think I get it your plan is to take him there am I right

209
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,247
Everybody has a place to go where they can feel good

210
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,367
For you Carl it's the rooftop of the University building where you go to watch all the city lights

211
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Mr Co

212
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,655
I think there's something wrong with the bathroom sink it could be clogged

213
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
Do you mind taking a look please

214
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,543
There might be water dripping out of those pipes see

215
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,551
Loca there's nothing wrong with the sink it's working

216
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,463
Open up come on open this door now

217
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
Stop playing around child

218
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:24,479
Open up the store now where are you going with Mr schumold open

219
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:36,511
Hey guys that's that mission accomplished let's go aren't you going to tell me where we're going

220
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:41,631
It's a surprise

221
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
Look lady

222
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,847
I'm well aware that you're not the real Margo Langer

223
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,455
I just want information on Edmund fahren the boy who died recently

224
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
He came to see you not long ago didn't he

225
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,575
Foreign remind me which one he was

226
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
Which one

227
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
Apparently I'm very popular

228
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
I had two pairs of visitors each said he was shoe volt kid

229
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Was he the blonde one

230
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,839
Or was he the one with the black hair

231
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
The black hair

232
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,703
Yeah the black haired one came with a girl isn't that funny

233
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,823
I still can't believe it actually show up with a girl in a place like black hair you say

234
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
Did the girl have glasses

235
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
I got photographs of them somewhere

236
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
At least two

237
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Yeah

238
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
That's who I saw

239
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
You're positive about this

240
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,743
He said that he was Hans gayorkshavald's son

241
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:46,143
Are you sure this is the right spot yeah I'm absolutely certain it should be right around here

242
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
Okay to tell me the name of the surprise

243
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,943
We brought you out to visit Ellenburg weather

244
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:05,343
We were hoping this place would cheer you up I'm sorry

245
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
Just let me out of the car

246
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,351
Can you see the lake from here

247
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,239
Leaves here always gets so beautiful in the fall

248
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
Yeah

249
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,567
Very much so

250
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,695
Way something

251
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:47,071
Is missing what happened to the wrens why don't I hear the chirping of the Reds

252
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Yeah I know

253
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
I'm so sorry

254
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
This place has changed

255
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,103
They've turned it into a construction site you can't hear them Carl

256
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,967
If you listen very carefully you can make them out

257
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,807
Little birds delightfully chirping in the trees

258
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,791
Minneapolis have ripened and fall into the ground

259
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:39,039
And when you turn in this direction

260
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,111
He will see a spectacular sight

261
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:49,023
Autumn Leaves a blazing color in the afternoon sun reflected on the

262
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
Surface of the water

263
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
Like in a huge mirror

264
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
You must see it

265
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
Don't you sir

266
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,543
It's hard to believe such wonders exist

267
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,744
I see it I can see it

268
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
Back up a second

269
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
I just remembered something

270
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
You told me that you had two pairs of visitors

271
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
And you mentioned that the black haired boy brought a girl with him

272
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
So then

273
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
That means the blonde brought someone

274
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,816
Oh yeah that's right he did have somebody with him

275
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,496
That kid kept mumbling his words I could barely understand what he was talking about

276
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:08,896
The gorgeous boy you came along with him and ended up doing the talking he was the one giving me the lowdown and hey

277
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Truth be told

278
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:19,136
If it's good looking pal would have turned around and claimed he was shoe vald Sun I wouldn't have had any trouble believing him

279
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,536
Who's the other guy tell me
