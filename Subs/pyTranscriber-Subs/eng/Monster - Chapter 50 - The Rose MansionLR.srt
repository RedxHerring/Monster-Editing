1
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:07,936
Oh that Mansion go right up the street you should be able to find it

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,752
I appreciate it

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,520
Thank you

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,056
You're welcome

5
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
Roses just like the

6
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
Sleeping Beauty

7
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,168
It's Anna my name is Anna Liebert

8
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,752
You go get him Mr Detective

9
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,408
It's because she was worried that something awful might happen to you I don't want you to get hurt

10
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,480
I care about you too

11
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
Were you dreaming just now

12
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
Detective

13
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
Hold on

14
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Who are you

15
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
Inspector lung

16
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,608
I work out of the German bka office

17
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,424
What do you want with me calm down

18
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
You don't have to get up relax

19
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
Nobody sent me to arrest you

20
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,824
I haven't even met with anyone in your division

21
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
You've been assigned a very nice room

22
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,624
I went to several hospitals that had connections to the former Czechoslovakian secret police before finding this one

23
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,928
And judging by your excellent care

24
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
You must be a pretty important person

25
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,096
To the Czechoslovakian secret police am I right

26
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,448
Please believe me I know everything you've been up to since you joined the Prague division

27
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,056
Inspector Zaman who at close ties of the secret police was beaten to death

28
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,664
The Prague station Chief into detectives were killed with poison whiskey bonbons

29
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,504
To investigators from a special task force who were tailing you

30
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
Were found shot

31
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
And at the moment

32
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,440
You're being pursued as the most likely suspect in all of these cases

33
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,280
If you were to be judged on circumstantial evidence alone

34
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,352
Then you'd be the murderer no I'm not

35
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
I'm completely innocent

36
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
Then what about that thin lanky fellow named Grimmer who inspectors aimon brought in for questioning the day before his murder

37
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,944
Mr Grimmer didn't kill anybody either he's not that kind of person so then who is the killer

38
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
Don't you know him

39
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
Don't you know who the murderer is

40
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
What is this

41
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
What are you talking about

42
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,791
If I knew who it was this wouldn't be happening to me

43
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
My God

44
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
So many people have stabbed me in the back

45
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
Now I find myself being framed for murder

46
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
And all the police want to do is lock me up

47
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,591
I've had enough of this damn it I'm so tired of being betrayed

48
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
You're a detective aren't you

49
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,087
Act like it you have to calmly dissect and scrutinize everything

50
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
Dig up the truth is rationally as you can

51
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:50,047
Even if you have to sacrifice your own happiness in the process

52
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,679
There is really only one way to prevent yourself from being betrayed

53
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,287
All you have to do is doubt the person you believe in the most

54
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
Who the hell said you had permission to be here

55
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,887
I want a meeting with your boss tell him I want to talk to him about

56
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,495
The red rose Mansion it's safe to say you'll want to meet with me right away

57
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,919
Inspector Lungi of the bka

58
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
I ran a background check

59
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
Dug up some of your past

60
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,879
I heard about your past too when the old regime was in power captain lanke

61
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:52,255
And now you are for all intents and purposes leader of the Czechoslovakian secret police

62
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
That's quite a position

63
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
Seems to be some trouble attached to you at the moment

64
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Why thank you for your concern

65
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,751
I'm envious of people in your position who can take such long vacations

66
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
2 years ago wasn't it

67
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:12,991
You're Relentless ways drove the Secretary of Mr boltzmann a candidate to lead the German Democratic Party

68
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Suicide

69
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
You have to be a lot smarter than that to move up in the world

70
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,927
You and your people were quite foolish

71
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
During the democratization if you had taken a softer approach and managed your secrecy you could have been the ones

72
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,191
Trolling the president's actions behind the scenes

73
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
However

74
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,103
Now the fear that people feel towards you and your men is merely an illusion with no basis in fact

75
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
So I see

76
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
You are quite clever

77
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
You asked to see me

78
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
So what does a clever man like you want

79
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
An answer

80
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,463
As you already know I'm on a long vacation but it's not entirely just a pleasure trip

81
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
I'm here looking for something

82
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,631
I'm looking for an embodiment of true fear

83
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,567
I want to find out if a real demon was born in that illusion that you created during the

84
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
The reign of the old regime you're referring to the Rose Mansion aren't you

85
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,439
I found it but before I got there I wandered around quite a bit

86
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,047
The man who wrote this picture book years ago use many pen names

87
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,631
The name he used when he wrote the nameless monster

88
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
Was a meal share Bay

89
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,983
His address was a room and an old building in Prague

90
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
At the moment

91
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
Someone else is renting that room

92
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
As Klaus Pope he lived on a farm deep in the countryside

93
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
But that place is already been torn down

94
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,551
The yakup far back name only led me to a rented office

95
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
But you didn't stop there did you

96
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
You finally arrived

97
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
Franz bought a partis

98
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
Strange place to live

99
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
The rose mansion

100
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
Franz Bonaparte

101
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,703
I wanted to know who he was

102
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:16,895
No matter how hard I searched I wasn't able to turn up anything on him that could only mean one thing that Bon

103
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:23,295
Florida was one of you that he's a former member of the Czechoslovakian secret police tell me what it is

104
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
That's simple

105
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,903
I want to know everything you know

106
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
I know nothing however however

107
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
There is something

108
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,679
I've consciously been trying to forget

109
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,567
And that is the fact that the rose mansion ever existed at all

110
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967
I've avoided thinking about it that's why it still stands there empty and untouched all of

111
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,367
The political prisoners who were taken there as well as the entire research staff just disappeared one night

112
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:04,767
I swear that's all I know

113
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,679
What's the reason for the plastered wall

114
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:18,079
What wall I went in yesterday there was no sign of anyone setting foot in there the

115
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,479
The Mansion was completely unoccupied and looked to have been abandoned for some time but the north wall

116
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
All in the second floor it looks like it was coated with plaster as though someone was trying to conceal something

117
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
With your permission

118
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:41,631
I'd like to tear that wall down

119
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Captain Lincoln

120
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:52,127
What are you afraid of I'm afraid you might die

121
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
If you get any closer you and I may end up facing an unimaginable experience

122
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,367
A true fear

123
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
Friends Bonaparte

124
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
Goodness haven't heard that name in a while

125
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,031
Would you like milk and sugar in your coffee

126
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
Black is just fine thank you

127
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
What's the matter

128
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Well

129
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,039
To tell you the truth I'm surprised that a friend's born apart a fan has just suddenly shown up

130
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,111
I got your name from the Moravia Publishing Company

131
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,719
It is my understanding that you were Mr bonaparte's editor for several years

132
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Is that right Mr zob

133
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
It is

134
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
I guided him and helped him as his edit

135
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
But that was only when he was writing under the pen name Klaus pop

136
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
I wonder if you can tell me more about him

137
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
Like what kind of person he was

138
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
He would come here to my home

139
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,199
We would discuss his work and sometimes rewrite sections of it

140
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,575
Oh yes it's sitting that chair in the same position you're in now

141
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,511
Often he would take a break and play in the garden with my daughter

142
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
I didn't think anything of it at the time

143
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
But my daughter said something

144
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
She said Papa that man is

145
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,847
Of course she was very young and now she's a full grown adult

146
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,895
I'm sure she's forgotten all about it

147
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:09,503
At that time could he have possibly been working for a government agency

148
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Well

149
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Probably

150
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
I did assume that but it was never discussed

151
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
However there was something about him

152
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,303
I guess it was his manners the way he spoke the clothes he wore

153
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,887
And the kindness that seemed out of place from the officials of the old regime

154
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,703
Bonaparta was a practicing psychiatrist

155
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
And also a medical doctor

156
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
He specialized in neurosurgery

157
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
I see

158
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,247
I'm trying to remember his last visit

159
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,319
It was a summer of 81 or 82 I believe

160
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,183
I recall that he just showed up here one day without any warning

161
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
He wanted to talk about a new book

162
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
Oh my goodness

163
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,327
How happy he appeared to be at the time

164
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
The new book

165
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
What was it about

166
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
Well it was about a monster Falling in Love

167
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,943
It was strange it was almost like a combination of Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty

168
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,271
Of course I vetoed it on the spot

169
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:20,671
Then at the door as he was preparing to say goodbye he just stopped and

170
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,767
Said maybe you like this better then he turned to look me in the eye

171
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:31,167
It's a story about a door that must not be opened under any circumstances

172
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,471
I asked him if Paradise was on the other side

173
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,079
If a monster would come through the door and he said no

174
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,383
You can't open the door

175
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,503
So I guess there's no story he left when he said that and then he was gone

176
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:52,159
And that was the last time I ever saw him

177
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:00,607
So doctor Tenma were you able to find out anything interesting or helpful about bonaparta

178
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,167
A little but not as much as I hoped

179
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:10,079
Mr Grimmer what are you doing here have you been following me around perhaps

180
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
I'm just sitting here enjoying the sunny weather

181
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
It's nice

182
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
You can say that again

183
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
I knew it was him

184
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
Is this the police department

185
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:29,791
My name is Joe Buck I live on schweig court in a private residence a suspicious man just left my home

186
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,655
Well I'm pretty certain he's the primary suspect in the serial murders that occurred in Germany

187
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Yes he's Japanese

188
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,519
He looks like that neurosurgeon Dr temma

189
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Ethanol

190
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
The smell of disinfectant

191
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
Nick dick

192
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:24,319
Death

193
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,647
How many people died here

194
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
420

195
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
I guess

196
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
A lot more

197
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:59,135
I've seen that woman before

198
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:05,535
She's the one from the Sketchbook could she be the mother of

199
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
Twins

200
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,775
Hurry up or the older boys will take over the field first

201
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Come on Milo hurry up I am hurrying

202
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,039
Fall back no one's defending the girl we're going to score

203
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:34,207
Oh man are

204
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
All right

205
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:43,679
A really nice day below you defended the Google good job evolution

206
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
He seems to be happy

207
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
He's all right now isn't

208
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
Well Dr Tenma

209
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
What do you think

210
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
He's fine

211
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Mr Grimmer wait up

212
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,511
Don't you want to spend some time with me lotion the other children

213
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,399
I suddenly realized why I'm not really all that good at soccer

214
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,983
I guess it has to do with playing as a team

215
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,127
I'm just thinking about what lies ahead for detective so

216
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,527
He's the prime suspect in a murder which means his career is over and his future is pretty much washed up as well

217
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Sad

218
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,159
Even if you were to turn himself in how's he going to be able to prove that he's innocent

219
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:41,791
And how is he going to find any evidence to verify that the blonde lady I saw leaving his place even exists

220
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,375
Souks in a similar situation to the one you're in

221
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
Except for him there's one big difference

222
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
What

223
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,335
Time for us to say goodbye doctor Tenma

224
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
Only one person knows it all

225
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,503
Everything concerning the events incriminating detective Sook

226
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
You're looking at him

227
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,135
Here give it a read

228
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,951
I think the police will be very interested when they get it

229
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
What is this

230
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,399
Just a letter written by the perpetrator of the recent series of killings

231
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,823
I even mentioned details the police haven't released I think it'll make a very compelling case for my being the real murderer

232
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,919
What if you send something like this to the police will be arrested

233
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,783
Oh but before that can happen Grimmer will suddenly disappear

234
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,087
The police will be Swift

235
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,671
The Grimmer will have already made His Brilliant escape to Germany say

236
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
After all

237
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,839
He used to be a pretty good spy you could slip his way out of tight spots think about it

238
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,959
You'll have no life you'll be forced to live on the run I'll be fine

239
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:59,359
The truth of the matter is Grimmer never really existed in the first place it's not who I am it's just

240
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:05,247
What's the name I was arbitrarily assigned one day so even if Grimmer is a suspect for the rest of his life

241
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
The real me is unaffected well anyway what do you think of my letter

242
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:18,047
Do you think the police will buy it never mind I guess now you

243
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
You'll be heading off to that Rose Mansion am I right

244
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
That's right

245
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:29,055
You're almost at the Finish Line your search might be coming to an end any minute I don't know I can't be sure

246
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,663
Even if I tell you not to do anything rash I suppose you won't listen just

247
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:40,319
Be careful

248
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:46,719
Mr Grimmer remember what you said when

249
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:53,119
When we parted at the check border let's have a picnic when we meet again we'll fish

250
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
For rainbow trout on a beautiful day

251
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,471
And have a good wine and cheese

252
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
I'm holding you to that

253
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
For the rest of my natural life that sound is going to haunt me at every turn

254
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,664
I hurt my knee it's bleeding alive

255
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,088
Don't be scared let me just see if you can move it

256
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,720
It's only a scrape but I'll put some antiseptic on it so it doesn't get infected

257
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,704
Tough it out you're a big boy you can handle it

258
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
That's better

259
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
You're very brave

260
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,296
Your Kensington is that correct

261
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:22,208
Prague police we have orders to take you to the station
