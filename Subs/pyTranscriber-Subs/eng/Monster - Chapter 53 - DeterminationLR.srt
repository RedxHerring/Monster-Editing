1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,984
Tell Elaine and Gustav that I'm counting on them to tape detective Forester the crime drama on television right now

00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
The boss isn't happy with

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,576
You're sloppy work

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,600
Do you have any idea how much

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,416
Trouble you caused by screwing up and getting yourself caught

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,536
Despite the fact that you are a complete idiot the boss still sent me here to be your legal coun

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,096
So how about showing him a bit of grat

12
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:41,472
Come on who do you think you're kidding you're here to keep an eye on me so I don't spill the beans right

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,008
I won't deny it

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
Listen up news

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,872
I presume you are aware of what would happen if you were to

16
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,688
Well aren't you

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,784
What are you so worried about I never read on any of my buddies

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
That's very smart

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,928
I need you to stick to the scenario that I laid out for you and confess all right

20
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,976
So is my next job been decided

21
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,512
I kind of like to prepare for it

22
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,792
What do you mean next job

23
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,400
Given your present situation you won't be getting out of prison anytime soon

24
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,448
Yeah how can you be so sure

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,360
Think about it did you forget who I am I'm going to Mills king of prison escapes

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
I'm getting way behind

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
So just stop the nonsense

28
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,808
If you follow the blueprint I'm drawing up and confess

29
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,904
You'll get out in about 5 years

30
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:38,048
I told you to tell Elaine and Gustav to tape detective Forster while I'm in lockup

31
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,656
Yeah but they're not very reliable are they

32
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
I may have to try it one more time

33
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm still at this station jail house

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,336
Try what

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
Are you sure he's not just faking it again I don't know he's hard to figure but I did see blood in his

36
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
Vomit and you can feel his body is really cold hey don't throw up in the hallway

37
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
Oh you came just in time I'm glad you're here keep an eye on this place for a bit they just brought in a few Young

38
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
Punctuate berserk on the third floor some people were injured so I need to get up there right away

39
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Looks like he's going to die at any moment

40
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,360
You back again just put him on a bed over there I'll take a look at him later

41
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:05,760
You better get me to hospital right away before I die

42
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,320
You'll be fine I won't be gone long

43
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,392
Damn all of a sudden it's getting busy in here today

44
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Give me a break you can't put me next to a serial killer I know my rights I demand another bed why is he even

45
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,639
Stop complaining milch that man's refused his meals and collapsed from starvation

46
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,039
He's hooked up to an IV I'm feeling a lot worse just being next to him see

47
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,159
Just lie there and be quiet doctor you said some people were injured do you have any idea how many

48
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:50,559
That's what I'll find out as soon as I get there wait till I get my hands on them those punks are going to do hard time when

49
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,423
I've been thinking about what you said the other day

50
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
Need you to help me

51
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,223
I have to get out of here

52
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
I'm thinking of killing

53
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
I'm thinking of killing your former fiance

54
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
The lovely Eva Heine

55
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:28,447
So what do you think personally I like the

56
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,031
The idea very much you know she's dangerous

57
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
She knows a little more than she should

58
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,407
That Rainy Night at the building the one under construction

59
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
She heard three distinct gun

60
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
And she saw someone as well

61
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
It was

62
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,439
No we don't need people like her complicating things

63
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,279
We really don't don't you agree oh yeah

64
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,095
You can't

65
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
It's not an option

66
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
She'll only Testify the things that will hurt me do you understand so so

67
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
That's why you need to take a little more time to consider my idea she'll be out of the way once and for all

68
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:28,095
And you may not have to go to prison if she's not on the witness stand

69
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,423
This could be very good for both of us

70
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,007
Elimination is the winning choice no matter how you look at

71
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
I mean what other options do you have

72
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,455
If you go to the police they won't believe you and accused murder

73
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,063
What are you going to do tell Mr verdeman

74
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
I wouldn't

75
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:55,487
I mean think about it he could be one of us who really knows

76
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
We'll make sure you're found innocent after all that's what we brilliant defense

77
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
And once you're free and moved out of this place you should have yourself a drink to celebrate

78
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
Just by that time that miserable stuck up loudmouth b**** will be long gone from this world never

79
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:21,087
Ever to be seen again

80
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
I want to

81
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
I'm allergic I can't sleep with this serial murder

82
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
Pregnant milk

83
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Hey knock it off

84
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
They'll be moving me out of this holding station in 5 days because I'm going to confess then it's goodbye forever

85
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
Cereal murders like you what's all the rocket for huh pretty fast recovery yeah

86
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,215
Just another one of your fake out

87
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm going to be rid of you in 5 days I'm done looking at your miserable face you're a real

88
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:21,247
So work milch I'm not already

89
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,487
Just five more days to go

90
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,375
So on that particular Rainy Night

91
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,215
From inside of building under construction you heard three gunshots

92
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,079
And soon afterwards saw a young blonde man come hurrying down the stairs

93
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
Is that correct Ms Heineman

94
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
That's right

95
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
Now what's the plan

96
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,319
Are you still proceeding with the case and denying Johan's existence

97
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
I don't know

98
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Listen Miss Heine

99
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,279
If I called upon you would you be willing to testify to this in open court

100
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
No I would not

101
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,927
What did Dr Tima possibly want this late at night would you kindly tell us what

102
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
What this is all about well I don't exactly know

103
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,815
He just asked to see you right away

104
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,543
So what did you want to talk to us about Dr Tenma

105
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,991
It dusseldorf's Isler Memorial Hospital there was

106
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,831
The director Dr heinemann

107
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:06,719
The chief of surgery Dr oppenheim and then Dr Boyer as well

108
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
Along with one Adolph Younkers

109
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
What's a patient of mine at the time

110
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:25,407
It was me I confess

111
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
I killed every one of them

112
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Hard

113
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
The bottle fell over

114
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
Sandwiches were covered in dirt that's when he

115
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,991
Smiled so sadly

116
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,815
According to this announcement made by the police

117
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
Murder suspect Kensington conf

118
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Shortly before Dawn

119
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,263
Up until now he had relentlessly kept silent about all the charges against

120
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,663
Now in regard to the killing of the director of Isler Memorial Hospital in Dusseldorf and two other doctors

121
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
As well as the murder of Adolf Jun

122
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
He has admitted

123
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
He committed these

124
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
But that can't be

125
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
This is breaking news

126
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
Shortly

127
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:48,351
Kensington who had previously maintained total Silence about the charges

128
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,727
Surprised authorities with his unexpected confession to the string of serial kill

129
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
I want the truth

130
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
Hey what the hell did you idiots do to 10

131
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,551
What method of torture did you subject him to in order to obtain that false confession huh

132
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,439
Please take your hand off me and calm down

133
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
I'll talk to him myself and find out what kind of treatment to receive during his questioning useless Dr Wright fine

134
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,823
I've already tried he won't even see me his own lawyer

135
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,431
It would appear that his confession was completely voluntary without any coercion

136
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
But that's impossible

137
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,599
I did a little research it turns out that his interrogators are men I know personally

138
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
And these are men who would never condone the use of torture

139
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
Tim must summon them both when he made his declaration

140
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
Then he proceeded to willingly admit his guilt

141
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
Wait Mr verdeman

142
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,703
You're actually suggesting his confession to the murders is genuine

143
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,615
How can I even begin to tell what he intended when he won't meet with me

144
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
Mr verdeman

145
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
You've Got to Believe

146
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,783
Dr Tema didn't commit murder

147
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
I still believe he's innocent

148
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Hello this is verdeman

149
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Oh

150
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:37,407
Mr ball

151
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
That's all right

152
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
How did it go

153
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
No

154
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,111
He refused to have anything to do with me what can I say I'm stunned

155
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,951
Here we are in the middle of an effort to prove is complete innocence

156
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,047
Working hard to get them to drop all the charges they have against him

157
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,607
Then he breaks down on fully confesses

158
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,775
No matter how unbearable he's interrogation God

159
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
He never once capitulated

160
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,151
Your father held steadfast was innocence

161
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
So then

162
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,623
Any idea of what we should do now to help out Tim

163
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,095
Person who can prove Dr temma's innocence

164
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
What did you say her name was

165
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Ava Heineman

166
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
Where is she

167
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
She's staying at a local hotel

168
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
I'd certainly like to meet her and hear what she has to say

169
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Well

170
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783
She can be a pretty difficult lady

171
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
I think for now I'll try meeting with her again myself

172
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:59,839
Where you admirable father

173
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,111
Miss heinemann it's Fritz verdemon

174
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,671
Could you open the door I'd like to speak to you for a moment

175
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,327
Look you might as well let me in I know perfectly well you're in there drinking because the maid's been trying to get in all day to tidy up the

176
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Place

177
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Miss Heineman

178
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,471
I fully understand that you have reasons to despise Dr T

179
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
Your father's death was a big loss for you to Bear but if your relationship with tinma had continued it would have helped

180
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Heal the pain of

181
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
Event and major life easier

182
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,295
When he broke off your relationship you felt very alone

183
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
Your life was thrown into turmoil

184
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,159
And you blamed Tenma for that

185
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
I'll tell you about my father

186
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
They sentenced him to 20 years for Espionage and murder for a very long time I was

187
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,727
It's called son of a spy fingers were pointed at me and I was shunned

188
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,055
My father's actions through my life into turmoil

189
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
But all that stuff didn't really bother me

190
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
Would you like to know why

191
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
Would you like to know how I was able to endure and keep on fighting it was because I believe

192
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
I truly believed

193
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
My father is innocent

194
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,279
My father is innocent

195
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
She was innocent

196
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
He was innocent

197
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,751
For me to represent someone I must first believe they are truly innocent I'm going to prove

198
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,207
I'm leaving you phone numbers for my partner and myself

199
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,303
When you're ready to testify please give us a call

200
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
What are you saying he's being transported to the Detention Center tomorrow he's only been here a few days why is he being rushed

201
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,791
That is standard police procedure after someone willing

202
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:44,959
Well can't we do something to delay at Mr verdeman

203
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,967
No she went out for all I know she's probably gone off to get drunk at some bar again

204
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
Tissotor

205
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,719
I remember all these places nothing has changed

206
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,023
I despise this town

207
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,559
Oh did you just get here

208
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:48,959
I've been sitting here staring at you for the last 5 minutes oh sorry but I've never seen anything more interesting than this book

209
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
I just had to write some of it down

210
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
Do you want to go somewhere else to get a bite to eat

211
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,639
Maybe you'd like some kind of foreign cuisine

212
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Italian might be good

213
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:03,551
How about French where would you like to go you name it don't let me tear you away from your book

214
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,975
Why don't you just keep on reading I didn't mean to AV

215
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
This sandwich

216
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:37,855
Is the best thing you brought your appetite

217
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
Pretty good huh

218
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
What are you doing

219
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Holding it down

220
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,911
I'm putting a rock on the edge of the blanket so it won't blow away in the Wind

221
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,751
That wasn't what I meant I'm wondering why you're putting down a blanket at all

222
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,567
It's fun having lunch out here every once in awhile

223
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
And the weather is nice too

224
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
And who would be having this lunch

225
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,039
The two of us of course I made my favorite sandwiches I hope you like them

226
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
There are bugs everywhere

227
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
It'll be all right

228
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
I've all got dirt on them now

229
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
I'm afraid they're ruin

230
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,927
You look hungry do you want this

231
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,255
Franz don't bother the lady

232
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:54,655

233
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:01,055
