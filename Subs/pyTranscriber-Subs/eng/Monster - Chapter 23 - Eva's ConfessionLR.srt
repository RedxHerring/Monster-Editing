1
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,144
You wake up

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,728
Leave me alone

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,032
Yeah like that's going to happen

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,568
Now get up

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,408
We can still do this the easy way come on this isn't a hotel

6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Don't touch me

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
How dare you

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,392
Do you have any idea who I am

9
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
All right

10
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,760
Here's all the stuff you came in with

11
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
If everything's in order you can sign here

12
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Ms Heineman

13
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,024
I don't ever want to see you tossed in the cooler again

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,400
Passing out drunk alone in the dark alley be thankful something horrible didn't happen to you

15
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
You got a cigarette

16
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
I'm just asking if you've got a cigarette

17
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,992
There's no smoking in the station go outside if you want to smoke

18
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Later

19
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
Where is my lighter

20
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
My bag

21
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
I want to know what you did with my bag

22
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,208
And I already told you it's the only bag you had

23
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,560
You liar I know you're not telling me the truth I had another shoulder bag where is it

24
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
Probably with whoever stole it from you when you passed out drunk in the all

25
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,984
What are you going to do about it I have valuables important things in there

26
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
I tell you what

27
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,336
You can fill out a theft report if you like

28
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
But I really wouldn't get your hopes up

29
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
How the hell did you lose your key

30
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,952
My bag was still in last night just hurry up and open the room for me

31
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
What what happened here

32
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Damn

33
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
Somebody really want to town

34
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,080
Oh man this is awful

35
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,872
I got to change the lock now

36
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,456
Which reminds me miss heinemann you still owe me back rent

37
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
I don't want to have to ask you again the deposit you put down is already run out I'm going to need the rest of what you

38
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,488
These people even broke into my damn suitcase are you listening

39
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
You have to pay for a new lock and all that back rent

40
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
Well I don't have any money

41
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
What

42
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
Fine I'll get out don't worry

43
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
Such a tragic story still I don't know what you expect me to do about

44
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
Any of it you know I seem to remember you being the one who stormed out on me oh come on that's

45
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,903
Ancient history now so I know buy me a drink

46
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
It's just a stolen purse for God's sake you must have had some extra cash checked away somewhere

47
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
Honestly have yet to meet another woman who could burn through money the way you do and here you are finally coming to me for

48
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,847
This is it welcome to Rock Bottom baby

49
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
I'll sleep with you you know

50
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063
I'm asking you how much you'd be willing to pay honey as

51
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,183
General rule most men won't pay to have sex with women they've already had a bunch of times

52
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
You can at least buy me a drink you'll find yourself a street corner to work who

53
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
She might get lucky and meet some Sad Sack is not too picky desperate and middle-aged and drunk must be someone's type

54
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
Yeah I'm positive you didn't leave any

55
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,319
Papers here last night maybe you left it wherever you went next

56
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,951
How to remember anything after I left this ball

57
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,279
If it's worth any money you might as well Kiss It Goodbye

58
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,631
No it's not it's not worth anything at all

59
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
Not any money that is

60
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Hey

61
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
I've been looking for you

62
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
I asked for you at the pub back there

63
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,343
And they told me you just headed in this direction

64
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
Yeah and who are you

65
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Are you serious

66
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
We had such a good time drinking last night

67
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
I was drinking with you

68
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Your bag

69
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
That's why I was looking for you

70
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
I guess this means I have to make

71
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
Awkward introductions again

72
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
I'm Roberto

73
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,407
So should we grab a little something to eat

74
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Your hotel room

75
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Really

76
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,343
That's terrible I'm so sorry I mean it's not like you did it

77
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Well no obviously not

78
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
I didn't even dare look in your back

79
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,255
Oh look my hotel keys are still in here

80
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
A little late for those

81
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
I don't need them anymore

82
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
I'm sorry it's all my fault

83
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,263
If I'd return your bag sooner you wouldn't have been kicked out of your room in the first place

84
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,871
Besides I'm very grateful that you gave me back my back

85
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,455
Honestly I'm kind of grateful that you lost it

86
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,575
Well last night as I watched you leave the pub I sat there thinking to myself

87
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
You shouldn't let this person slip away

88
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
And now thanks to your bag

89
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
Here you are and here I am

90
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
You have something very important in there don't you

91
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
I do

92
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
This is all that I have left in the world

93
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
A photo album

94
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
May I take a look

95
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
That's my father

96
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
He looks just like I imagine

97
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,903
He was a hospital director right

98
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
Yeah did I talk about him last night

99
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
You did you spoke very highly of

100
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
You mentioned that he died 10 years ago

101
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
I could tell that you still miss him

102
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
Let's see

103
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
The ex-fiance

104
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,847
Please don't tell me I told you about him

105
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
I believe his name was Tem

106
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Quite a guy

107
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
This Tenma

108
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
I really want to know what I said last night

109
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
Well I wouldn't make a habit of it

110
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
It might end up making other men jealous

111
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
On this page is empty

112
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Is that so

113
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,959
The photos that were on this page looks like somebody tore them out

114
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,287
Well I guess I didn't need those pictures anymore

115
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
So I see

116
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
Hey

117
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Let's get a drink

118
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Sounds good

119
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
So you were running a security company

120
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
I'm impressed yeah

121
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
In the south of France

122
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,703
Then we had a bad day and one of our better clients was killed on my watch

123
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
So that was the end of that

124
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
We're both going through tough times forget it let's drink to the hearing now enjoy yourself

125
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
You know

126
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
It's good stuff huh

127
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
So you like this song too

128
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Of course

129
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Let's Dance

130
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,871
Come on

131
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:30,271
I don't really know how to dance around me

132
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,879
God

133
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
I know a man who love this song he wasn't a very good dancer either

134
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
So you'd end up dancing like this

135
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
That's right

136
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:54,335
How fun

137
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
How about another drink

138
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
Just one more

139
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
Thanks but I'm good

140
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
Lightweight

141
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Time for bed

142
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
Sounds good to me babe

143
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
There's just one more thing

144
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
What's that

145
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Pictures

146
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Where are they

147
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
What pictures

148
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,527
Stop playing stuff

149
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,855
Those photographs you took out of the album

150
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:44,255
Where'd you hide them tell me see I'm

151
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
Your little secret you're looking for Tenma aren't you

152
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:57,055
I know you get those photos from burning and I'm sure you have them with you somewhere

153
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
Know where 10 - yeah

154
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,855
Photographs that you're talking about

155
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,439
May the ones with father in that boy am I right

156
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
Wasn't it

157
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
Him you know blonde Charming handsome he's grown up well I

158
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,335
A year ago and Dusseldorf

159
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
Enzo let's start over you

160
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
Do you need me

161
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,535
Enzo

162
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,143

I will get you back because you're mine

164
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:07,967
So

165
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
What are you up to these days

166
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
I've heard all sorts of rumors

167
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
The rumors are probably true

168
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
I've been married and divorced three times now

169
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,559
Between my father's inheritance and my alimony I'm living pretty comfortably

170
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,143
But enough about me how is life been treating you Dr Becker

171
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Huh

172
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
I don't know

173
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
Nothing's changed with me

174
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
I still have no chance of moving up in the world

175
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,687
Speaking of which technima's now chief of surgery where it is he's on his way to becoming Hospital director love to be

176
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
In his shoes let me tell you

177
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,343
But please who am I kidding it ain't so bad I still managed to have a good time

178
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:51,487
There's more to life than promotions I never want to be like 10 men have no time for women or fun what's the point

179
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
Is Kenzo

180
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,167
Do you know by any chance if Dr Tenma ever did settle down

181
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
No not yet

182
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
And a be completely honest I've introduced him to quite a few very nice women but you know him no interest at all his work

183
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Comes first

184
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
As a matter of fact I'm about to set him up with a new girl God only knows if it's going to work out she's the daughter of

185
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,855
Picture of a state senator and she is absolutely beautiful

186
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
If she can't keep his attention that I give up

187
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,743
But anyway you called me about something

188
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
How can I be of service Ava

189
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:31,167
You know back when you were the daughter of the hospital director you never even gave me the time of day

190
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
Who would have thought that you'd even think to call

191
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
I understand you're well off

192
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
But really

193
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
I think you're getting lonely aren't you

194
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,991
I mean it when I say it Eva I'm more than happy to listen anytime

195
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
Look I don't want you to let them meet up

196
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,415
Dr tenman the state senators daughter

197
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Don't let him meet her

198
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Man I should have known

199
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
You're still in love with him

200
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
Don't let him

201
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:36,191
Do me a favor don't screw it up this time I went out of my way to set this one up for you then

202
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,751
Well we'll see about that

203
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:49,247
This is it this is the clock that Mr Yonkers was talking about at the hospital

204
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
Excuse me about the clock what's going on

205
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
What are you doing

206
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
That's a very beautiful watch

207
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:33,535
Why thank you I mean I wear a watch but mine is nothing a trinket

208
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,607
Honestly I don't even check the time anymore

209
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
I wonder why

210
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,239
Time seems to be moving faster and faster

211
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
Excuse me but who are you

212
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:51,199
I'm sorry I don't mean to be rude but are you Senator Burgers daughter Angelica

213
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Goodness

214
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,807
You're a pretty little thing well aren't you

215
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
I thank you

216
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:03,743
I think and you're convinced that the entire world revolves around you

217
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Am I right

218
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,679
Going through life thinking that there's nothing you can't have it must be very pleasant

219
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:18,335
I'm sorry what are you trying to say I'm confused who are you exactly

220
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,431
I have this tiny little birthmark on my inner thigh

221
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
He used to kiss it

222
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599
How he used to love kissing me there

223
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
After 10 minutes

224
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
You know him

225
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Oh no

226
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:51,103
See see she left because you were late and it's all because you had to stop in that store

227
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,431
Oh too bad I'm sorry about that

228
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
Can you do me a favor and apologize for me

229
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
Oh wait

230
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:05,951
Hey turn off

231
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:12,351
Maybe if you give her a call right now she might come back who

232
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:18,751
I want to stop by the hospital for a quick minute what at this hour

233
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:25,151

00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:11,712
