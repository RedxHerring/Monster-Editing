1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,400
Go on young man eat this place is known for its tasty Vice verse

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,960
Isn't it wonderful

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,752
Your name is Dieter right

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:17,152
Doctor you better eat now or there might not be anything left when dieters done

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,480
There's no need to worry Dr Tenma

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,784
This place is safe

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,832
Only local folks come here

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,392
And if a strange face tries to get in

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,952
A friend Otto here will show them the door

10
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,048
You know business is really dropped off since I've been doing that

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,888
Now who just ordered the spatzler oh that would be me

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,216
I pulled together a bed in the ATT

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,544
If you can ignore the rats you should sleep pretty good up there

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,848
Thanks I owe you one

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,456
He's quite a kid here but a decent guy

16
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,528
You can't do much on an empty stomach

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
Thank you

18
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
For getting me a safe place to sleep

19
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,416
I should be the one who's thanking you

20
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:05,024
By now I'd be dead in the morgue if you hadn't come along and rescued me like you did

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,632
He didn't death makes this meal taste even better

22
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
Deacon

23
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,520
I already spoke to Dr Gillen

24
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
He was very pleased and relieved to hear that we found you

25
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,664
He left an ad in the local newspaper trying to contact you

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
Did you see it by any chance

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
Let's talk about our memories of cheating

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
So you did see it

29
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
I did

30
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,416
Well then why didn't you try to contact him

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
Because

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
I didn't want anyone else getting involved

33
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
But that's what friends are for

34
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
Especially during times like these

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,800
Earlier you said you were watching over me

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
That's because of the Richard Brown incident

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Please explain

38
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:58,784
You probably know best what happened to him Brown was drunk when he shot down that young serial killer

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
That night cost him his career and his family

40
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
As I read about the boy Richard had killed due to recognize the photograph theater said that

41
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,560
Boy was in 511 kenderhe

42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960
And what's 511 kinderheim it's an orphanage that was in East Germany

43
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Very special one Peter's Foster father was one of the instructors and he kept pictures of the children

44
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
That live there

45
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
And this orphanage figures into things Johann used to call it home huh so you're saying there's

46
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
The connection between Johann and the serial killer that Richard shot I'm not sure Brown died

47
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,512
Before I could get any details from him to tie the soul together

48
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,912
But he led me to you I saw you what is grave I thought you might be able to fill in some of the

49
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
Blacks so that's it oh Richard even in death you're still helping us get to the

50
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,384
Bottom of this

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
I know that until now you've been all alone out there but now we're going to solve this together

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,392
We must strive to prove that you're innocent I think I know where we can find Johan

53
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
Wait till you get a load of this I thought I had it on me damn I had a photo of Johann before

54
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:20,192
All the stupid I must have left it in the office when I was attacked if you left that picture there that man

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,312
Trying to kill you probably found it if that's the case it's good it's gone

56
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:31,712
That man said he'd been sending me for counseling by his wife her last name was Hess but there was nobody

57
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
I could find with that last name he was a hitman and he certainly tried to live up to that title

58
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
Yohan is here and so am I there must be a way to actually meet

59
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,400
Right I will meet you on face to face

60
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,583
Welcome to talbach and shoebald AG

61
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,679
This is their headquarters the epicenter of the shoe volt Financial Group

62
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,031
A year ago Mr shoevold was rarely here but lately he's been around a lot

63
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,127
Every morning Mr shoevold leaves here to tour his Affiliated offices

64
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,943
Richard discovered this pattern when he was still alive

65
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
This firm has grown exponentially as of late

66
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:47,903
His entire financial group has seen huge growth in profits and the reason for all this is quite clear

67
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:53,279
The turnaround began when a certain youth became true bald right-hand man

68
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
And here they come now

69
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
Two balls the older man in the wheelchair

70
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
Carl's the young man pushing him

71
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
Now look closely

72
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,495
Tell me is the blonde

73
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Johan

74
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
That was him

75
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
There's no doubt

76
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Good

77
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
This was the first time I've only seen him at night I've never seen

78
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:54,207
Johann in the daytime before well I'd say it's right about

79
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
This is my only chance that's true we might not have another chance to prove

80
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
Innocence but we must be judicious here you better keep lying low in Autos attic for now to prove

81
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,823
Renaissance we must be thorough and methodical

82
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
I should have another look at Richard's file

83
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Nah here it is

84
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,599
Good thing I decided to bring this one home

85
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
Yes my friend

86
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
It'll be just a little longer Richard

87
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
I promise you

88
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
We will avenge your death soon

89
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
We have discovered Johan

90
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,591
And we've got Dr Tenma the key witness there's just one thing left to do

91
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
One thing

92
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,991
All that's left is to find someone who saw Richard the night he died

93
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
There's got to be someone

94
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,159
Once we find that person we will be able to prove that Johan was with Richard the night that he was killed

95
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,303
Even if that doesn't work out there's that young man foreign who claimed he was shuvall's son and then committed suicide

96
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,679
If we can find that prostitute foreign visited we'll be able to prove that Johan was there with him

97
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,263
We've got to find someone who can put Johanna the scene of the crime

98
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:18,175
There's even a third way to make our case we can question the couple who claim their johann's parents and then we'll be able to find out

99
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
Who this imposter really is

100
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,319
Keep in mind that we've discovered the real Johan liebert's burial plot

101
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,159
We're slowly tightening the Noose around this Johann character's neck

102
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:38,143
You know Tim looking at your sad eyes I find myself feeling the way I did when I looked at Richard

103
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
You look like

104
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,359
Well it says if you're trying to take on the Troubles of the whole planet but don't despair 10 ma you're not alone

105
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
There's Dieter and now you've got Dr Gillen and I'm here as well things are

106
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,599
You going to be all right from now on now go get yourself some sleep

107
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Because

108
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,911
I didn't want anyone else getting involved this was the first time

109
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:17,311
I've only seen him at night I've never seen Johann in the daytime before

110
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:23,711
This is my only chance

111
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:30,111
Why aren't you get out of here now now run

112
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,423
This is right Vine speaking

113
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,335
Ah what a coincidence I was about to call you to discuss what our next move should be

114
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
I'll stop by later today

115
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
By the way

116
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,599
Tell my why he's at the safe house wherever he is I need you to make sure that he stays put

117
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
There's an issue that's been bothering me

118
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
I don't want to believe it

119
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
But that's exactly what I'm worried about

120
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,391
Peter

121
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:42,047
What are you doing here

122
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
He told me

123
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
He sent me over here

124
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Then

125
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
Where's Tim

126
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Gone

127
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
To where

128
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Take care of it

129
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
What

130
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
Dennis planning to fix it himself

131
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
Stop and doctor

132
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,367
Please you got to stop him

133
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:12,767
Don't let him do it 10 minutes going to become a killer

134
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
That's enough for today

135
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
We're done

136
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,487
Don't say that now I'm just getting warmed up

137
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,303
Doc this is where it gets real interesting

138
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Not today

139
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
We'll pick it up from here next time

140
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
How about that

141
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,263
I tell you the third one I killed now that's a great story to hear

142
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,663
She was only 18

143
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
My house is great she had no clue

144
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
Where's Timber Run off too

145
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Thank Rudy

146
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
Greetings Dr Killen

147
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
At last we meet

148
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
And who are you

149
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,359
My name is inspector Lungi I'm with the bka

150
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,479
Actually I'm well acquainted with your work Detective

151
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:41,087
You've been responsible for the apprehension of many of the serial killers that I've interviewed

152
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,487
Since I read your book one could say that I know of you as well

153
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Why thank you

154
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
What a remarkable piece of work

155
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,655
Transcendental criminal psychology

156
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,311
What makes it a great book is that you possess deep inside into what goes on in the mind of a serial killer

157
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
I especially liked your explanation of what motivated Heinz calls behavior in Chapter 3 of your book

158
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,271
Pages 262 to 294

159
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:16,671
I tend to agree with your supposition that the trauma he experienced during his childhood turned him into a sociopath

160
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
And then a criminal

161
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,839
Well then we think the same way I feel honored that you've read my book so thoroughly

162
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,959
My investigative methods also require me to get into the minds of these criminals

163
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:34,079
I try to predict what their actions will be by acting out what it is I think they'll do next

164
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
It sounds like you have a lot of experience

165
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,967
We should discuss your techniques when we have more time

166
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:45,087
I would have to agree that neither of us have much time I need to ask you something now

167
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Lately

168
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
You've been driving a lot to Munich isn't that correct

169
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
That's right what of it

170
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,047
Please doctor have a seat for a minute

171
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
This won't take very long

172
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,495
You seen a psychologist named right fine three times this week

173
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Why so often

174
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Simple

175
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
He was one of my professors from University

176
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Dusseldorf University

177
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
Correct

178
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,759
There was someone special in your class

179
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,111
This one fellow student of yours who went on to become a brilliant neurosurgeon

180
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,463
Where are you going with all this have you met up

181
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
With Dr Tenma

182
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
No what are you talking about

183
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
Allow me to refresh your memory

184
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
Let's talk about our memories of cheating

185
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Rudy

186
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,591
You place that classified ad in every leading newspaper in the country from May 1st to the 22nd

187
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
Imagine my surprise

188
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
Shocking

189
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,271
I never thought brilliant people like you or Dr Tema ever had to cheat

190
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,343
Even as students it seems out of character for the two of you

191
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
It's interesting with best friends will do

192
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:57,279
Inspector I wouldn't say the doctor Tim and I were even friends when we attended dusseldor

193
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
Last man no deer park with your help the velbert police were able to surround Dr Tenma they were poised to take him

194
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Into custody

195
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
But at the last second

196
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:11,615
He miraculously escaped well then you must also know that the wire I was wearing malfunctioned

197
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,199
It's still possible that you might have helped him to escape

198
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Come on

199
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,575
I know the Tema is innocent

200
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
Really

201
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,927
Have an open mind and listen to me

202
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:30,047
The director of Isler Memorial Hospital and three other people that were murdered in Dusseldorf

203
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,375
The murder of a patient in a building under construction

204
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
And the murder and Heidelberg

205
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,007
The middle-aged couples that were murdered across the country

206
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,335
Those were the works of a Madman not tena

207
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,175
I reached this conclusion from interviewing Dr Tenma in person

208
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,991
As a criminal psychologist interesting

209
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
So

210
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
Where is he now

211
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,879
Who knows he's run off somewhere again

212
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
Why did he run away

213
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,023
Why would he run away if he were innocent he is innocent

214
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,399
You think so he needs friends like you to help him so why would he leave you in the dark

215
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
Well

216
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,335
I have proof that he isn't the murderer you think he is

217
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,919
Have a look at this inspector

218
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,551
I personally compiled this analysis of all the evidence in this case

219
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
You're very thorough

220
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
So tell me

221
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,599
Do you understand my conclusion yes

222
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,975
A strange death of foreign the boy who pretended to be shoe Volt's son

223
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,119
The seemingly accidental death of ex-police detective Richard Brown who was investigating this case

224
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,703
The questions and rumors surrounding shuvalt's illegitimate child

225
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,543
There's a young man who's at the center of this entire case

226
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,407
When timma was questioned by police he named this young man as the real murderer

227
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
Johan Liebert

228
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:31,135
Well he was still alive Richard Brown discovered a gravestone of a person with that same first and last name in

229
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:37,535
Call furthermore someone who admitted to being a Hitman tried to kill Dr reichfying after he picked up the investigation

230
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
From where Brown had left off

231
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
Oh I understand quite well

232
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
But you're wrong it's impossible to actually prove that all these separate events are connected

233
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,271
10 minutes has gone into hiding because he understands this more than anyone does

234
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:05,951
Am I wrong

235
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:12,095
I keep noticing that you tap your fingers

236
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
That's just a little habit I have

237
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
It helps me to remember important points in a case

238
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
As a psychologist it appears to me that your own anxiety is manifesting itself in the way you constantly do it

239
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
I do the same thing

240
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
I use my recorder instead of my hand however the sounds that are recorded on this device are Absol

241
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:41,023
Will be objective but in your case the information that you remember when you're drumming your fingers

242
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,351
Has already been tainted by your own preset opinions

243
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:51,007
That's probably how you've always done your job inspector for all these years right up until now

244
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
You believe that your memory is correct and that your judgment couldn't possibly be wrong do you have a wife or a

245
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,807
Family any hobbies outside your work you live for your job don't you ever

246
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
Made a mistake inside aren't you terribly afraid to make a mistake the way you think everything's black or

247
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,655
And if your judgment turned out to be wrong your whole world would fall apart

248
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:25,055
This is a recent photograph of Johan lemert

249
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:29,919
Can you prove all the deaths surrounding Johan is just coincidence

250
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
This young man

251
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,719
Where would I find him this very moment

252
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
He's a student at the University of mun

253
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,095
At the moment he shove out private secretary

254
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
So this is him

255
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,239
I'll need to hold on to this Photograph doctor

256
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,359
From this point on let's consider this a police matter

257
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
You know

258
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,271
Perhaps I made a terrible mistake

259
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,087
Where is Dr Tema right now

260
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
He should

261
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
Still being Munich

262
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
Yes this is Lungi

263
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
Put me through to the Munich police

264
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,295
I need an emergency deployment

265
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,231
Dr Tema is somewhere in the city of Munich

266
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
A sniper rifle

267
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,471
Oh look I don't got a clue what you're talking about

268
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,335
Wait so Mr hightmeyer didn't call you from his Mountain Villa in full sun

269
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
10,000 Deutsche marks in advance

270
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,928
Your order is a little complicated for me to fill

271
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,976
It'll take about a week to get it

272
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,048
In the meantime go get some sun you look pale

273
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:27,168
Listen you're getting yourself a good piece but it's a waste if you don't know how to use it

274
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Just remember that

275
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
Next in the news

276
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
City officials attended a posh reception for the Munich electronics Industry trade show that's being hosted this weekend

277
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,856
By the state's Chamber of Commerce in association with local Business Leaders

278
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,952
Political and business figures from all over the world are attending

279
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:56,352
With the formation of the EU the various Industries are going to become the center of Europe media Network

280
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:02,752
This is the largest trade show Munich has ever hosted and the monetary impact on the local economy from this event is

281
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Is in the

282
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,944
Noted industrialist Hans Georg who hasn't appeared in public for nearly 20 years

283
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,040
Was seen at the reception and received rousing Applause from the attend

284
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,624
Mr Shoe hold was in a wheelchair but he appeared healthy
