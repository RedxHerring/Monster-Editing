1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,888
That's good enough

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,984
When you say that just what exactly do you mean Mr shoevald

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,104
I've decided that I've learned enough I am calling off the investigation

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,504
But sir we had a breakthrough and I'm close to another I checked out Carl Norman and one thing certain that boys

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,088
Real son I'm quite grateful to you for all you've done

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
Now hold on there's still more to be done there's still the Edmund foreign they should have figured out Edmund pretended to be your

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
He didn't really commit suicide if that's really the case someone else

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,192
Just pulling the strings and may have killed foreign

9
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
It has been solved to my satisfaction

10
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:51,712
Father I made some tea would you care for some yes I would

11
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,272
Good afternoon Detective

12
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:02,976
Would you care to join us no thank you I'll be going

13
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,816
Once again good work just send me your bill

14
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
Good day

15
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:13,984
It sure looks nice outside oh and Johan's come as well

16
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,336
What a surprise so johann's decided to visit

17
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,040
Shoe volt it always been known as a distrustful man with a sour disposition

18
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,648
Who would have thought that he turned into such a good-natured soul when he found his son

19
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,464
Well that smile of his

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,328
Who'd have guessed that people still call him the vampire of Bavaria

21
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,680
What a surprise so your heart's decided to visit

22
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
How cute

23
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,872
So you're trying to track down this puppy

24
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
What a job

25
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,760
My client told me her ex-husband basically dognapped a little fell

26
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,392
I guess disputes over pets can be just as bad as one's over kids

27
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
You're right about that

28
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,512
I think I left some wine if that's quite all right with you

29
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
Are you go ahead

30
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
I'll be sticking with a sparkling water

31
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
I'm glad to hear you say that I know it works scarce at the moment but it's a good choice on your part not to Cloud your life with

32
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Alcohol

33
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
I'm doing okay

34
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Least of that account

35
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
What do you mean

36
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,200
Are you saying there's something else in your life that's bothering you

37
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:08,064
Well I find that with all the free time I have now I end up rehashing things a lot

38
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Such as

39
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
I spend hours and hours pouring over this personal notebook I have of unsolved crimes cases I never solved as

40
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Detective

41
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
How interesting

42
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
So tell me when you look at it how do you feel

43
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
I feel frustrated

44
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,983
There were so many murder cases I wasn't able to solve

45
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,591
It haunts me to think of those vicious Killers still out there walking around in our world

46
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,151
They're free because of my incompetence

47
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,711
Even now I can't seem to catch them

48
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
You're being too hard on yourself

49
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,159
You could have caught them you had the skills to solve those cases but yourself critical nature was impeding you Richard

50
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,767
You got frustrated that you couldn't read these murderer's minds and that caused you pain

51
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
So I turned to alcohol

52
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
Sure of course you did gentleman

53
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
Dinner is served

54
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
Oh good it's time to eat

55
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,663
Actually I think it would be in your best interest for you to keep trying

56
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,271
I would encourage you to keep looking at your old police notebook

57
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
But why

58
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
I'll just become angry again

59
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Stop thinking that way

60
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,463
You have to analyze what you did in the past in a new light

61
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
Your mind is clearer now that should help

62
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,887
Let's be frank with each other we both know that you shot a young serial killer when you were drunk

63
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,239
And I must say you are facing the reality of what happened that night admirably

64
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,567
But now Richard you face a far greater challenge

65
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,383
Facing your thoughts when you pulled that trigger

66
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
You're still haunted by that boy

67
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
You see him in your mind everyday don't you

68
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
When you brought everything to light

69
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,255
All those things festering under the surface

70
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
That boys ghost will finally move on

71
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
I see

72
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
When I've brought everything to light huh

73
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,335
The Homer murder case is a good place to start

74
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,199
The victim you I came home or had a long and steady career as an accountant

75
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
He was never involved in anything shady

76
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
They had no enemies

77
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
And when he was murdered

78
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
There were no signs of a robbery

79
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,231
Then there were those two voice of God cases

80
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
The victims were a former housekeeper and a chauffeur

81
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:03,167
What connected those two killings was that the words I have heard the voice of God were left

82
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,983
Scroll on a wall at both crime scenes

83
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
The door knock company president case

84
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:17,247
Go to Gall cuz one of the wealthiest businessmen in Bavaria and his body was discovered in the heart told Forest

85
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
And then there's the spirit a couple case

86
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,719
Both were forcibly drowned at their bodies washed up along the east our River later on

87
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,583
This one's still being investigated is one of a string of murders involving middle-aged couples

88
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,959
A material witness in that case disappeared Japanese Doctor Who's still on the Run

89
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
Oh man

90
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,663
The more unsolved cases I had the more booze I drank

91
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
Then it felt good

92
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,807
Different now this is tough

93
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:57,439
It feels just like the doctor said so I'm sober my mind is clear and I'm feeling calm

94
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
Hold on a second

95
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Come on think

96
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
Playing card Richard

97
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
So

98
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
You tried doing it again and what was the result

99
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
I did

100
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
I looked at all my notes

101
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
And I thought of something new but

102
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
But then I

103
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,991
You saw that boy's ghost again and once that happened you lost your train of thought right

104
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
There's no need to worry

105
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,671
When you have an important thought like that sooner or later it will come back to you

106
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
What was it that I realized

107
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:14,751
An idea flash through my mind it felt like it was a key to solving one of those cases

108
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
Just My Imagination

109
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
Who's there

110
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,887
Show Yourself whoever you are I'll catch you

111
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Just like that time way back I was

112
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
Sorry for coming here so late at night doc

113
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Nons

114
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,751
If you think you've figured things out and you're ready to share them go ahead then tell me everything

115
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,359
Back then I felt myself looking deep within that killer

116
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,199
That's when I knew it existed in this world

117
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
Later was true evil

118
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
And once I saw it standing right there in front of me I shot and killed him

119
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
That's good thank you for sharing Richard by telling me this you're well in the road to recover

120
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
There's still more doctor

121
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
It just came to me that idea that it flashed through my mind before all

122
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,871
All those unsalt cases I have been working to solve separately I realized

123
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,247
They are actually one single case huh

124
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
Greetings my dear Dr Gillen

125
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,975
I'm writing to thank you for sending me a copy of your recently published book

126
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Transcendental criminal psychology

127
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
I found your book informative and a very interesting read and it pleases me to see that a student of mine from Duss

128
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
University

129
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,055
Has now become a leading Authority in the field of criminal psychology

130
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
Now I have a question for you regarding another matter

131
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:34,527
You told me in a phone conversation that you conducted the lengthy interview with the serial murderer Peter J

132
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,927
After you spoke with him you told me that Jergens claim that a friend of is it encouraged him to murder the victims

133
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,535
Sadly my memory isn't what it used to be so could you please tell me again

134
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,375
What was the name of jurgen's friend who he said told him to kill

135
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,127
I'd appreciate that information as it may Aiden associate of mine

136
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
P

137
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,295
As I mentioned earlier you were quite a student in college and excelled in my class

138
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
And you had a fellow colleague who was equally bright

139
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,927
You often competed with him for the best marks

140
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,487
He graduated and became a neurosur

141
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,351
At any rate it seems that he's become a suspect in a Multiple homicide case

142
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,959
With your expertise I'm hoping you could help me get a better picture of who he is

143
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
Please tell me everything you might know about him

144
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
What kind of person is he

145
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
Where do you think he might be right now

146
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
This doctor Tenma

147
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
I remember you you're a detective

148
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
It will I used to be

149
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,367
And now I'm a private investigator

150
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,439
I'm sorry to show up unannounced here at your

151
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,023
And I hate to bring up a subject I know must be painful

152
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,863
I'd appreciate it if I could ask you some questions again

153
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,263
Of course you can it's been 4 years since I last spoke to the police and it seems like they're done with their investigation

154
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Mr

155
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
Yes I believe your mother was actually employed

156
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,967
Wasn't she once the head housekeeper at his mansion

157
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
Well at that time she became very ill

158
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,535
And after her sickness she only worked close to home in the neighborhood

159
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,887
Was that it or could it be she had some problem with Mr Chev

160
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
No not at all

161
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,079
They were actually quite good friends she told me that she used to read poetry to Mr schubald when he was still able to see

162
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
My mother just loved reading poems to him

163
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Come along

164
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
I want to show you something

165
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Look how generous he was to her

166
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,719
I've kept all of them because they remind me of my dear Mother

167
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:57,631
Every one of those books are collections of poetry that were given to my mother as a thank you from Mr schub

168
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
How are things change

169
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,871
The head detective and the door knock company president cases now just a private eye

170
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,223
Do you worked as Mr gox Chief business liaison and personal secretary

171
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
I asked you once again did anyone hold a grudge against him

172
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
You mean did anyone hate him

173
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,439
There aren't enough hours in the day to count all the people who despise him

174
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:28,095
In business Mr God was such a fierce adversary that he personally forced some of our competition to go bankrupt

175
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,703
But there was another powerful and well-known businessman in Bavaria wasn't there

176
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
How did Mr gauch feel about him

177
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
I take it you mean Mr schewald

178
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,199
Well they were lifelong rivals in business but of course you knew that right

179
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
They knew each other very well

180
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,367
When Mystic golf was still alive she was company went bankrupt two

181
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:56,511
That second bankruptcy happened when Mr gauch undercut two volts prices for the purpose of ruining him

182
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,607
So what you're saying is the Mr gauch was consciously trying to crush him

183
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,703
Mr schewald made certain we suffered serious losses too

184
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
So then they both hated each other

185
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Of course

186
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,151
A few times they happen to be at the same party and it looks could kill they both would have been dead

187
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,711
Oh it was very tense they had expl

188
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Fight

189
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
Like to Vipers

190
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
But those snakes understood each other's every move

191
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,183
Only those two tycoons could talk to each other on the same level

192
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
I never felt like they were enemies

193
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,071
This may sound weird but they were really more like friends

194
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
Hey careful up there

195
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
Careful up there

196
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
Oh yeah

197
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
I knew Hans real well

198
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
Poor Hans was one of those two people that ended up being victims in that awful voice of God murder case that Hans was

199
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
A good guy he deserves better

200
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,687
Just what is it that makes you say Hans was such a good guy

201
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,271
He was nice always treated me to a drink or two

202
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Generous huh

203
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,927
I heard that Hans used to work for Mr shoe ball as his driver

204
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,559
He told me that but he worked at Shoe volts driver almost 30 years ago

205
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
Did Hans say why he stopped driving for Mr chevald well that was around the time old shoe volts company went bankrupt

206
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
So Hans never said that he and his boss didn't get along listen to me what I'm about to say is to honor the memory of Hans

207
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
If ever there was a guy who could get along with anybody and everybody it was Hans he was a prince even

208
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,879
Rich bastards like that vampire of Bavaria shoe vault

209
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,279
He treated us poor folks like kings and Hans always said he was the one who taught you about bird watching

210
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:11,679
A time about bird watching a vampire when he took

211
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Welcome to the forest

212
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
It's hard to believe that was 2 years ago

213
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
But whenever I think of my dear husband

214
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,783
I just can't understand why such a kind and wonderful man ended up being murdered

215
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
It's unfair

216
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
He tied so horrib

217
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
You have my sympathies

218
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
Pardon my ask

219
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,999
But I believe your husband grew up as

220
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,399
Yes he lived in an orphanage till he was six then with different Foster families until he was 18

221
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
After that he became an accountant

222
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:50,335
Is it true Mr scheuvo the business tycoon asked your husband to be his corporate accountant

223
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
He did many times

224
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
But my husband always turned him down

225
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,015
My husband was quite busy with work at the time but that wasn't why

226
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,367
He said Mr scheuvald had a different set of financial principles

227
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,183
When it came to money my husband was very honest

228
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,279
Again thank you so much I appreciate the help

229
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
My husband's killer

230
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Will he ever be caught

231
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
I'll try my best

232
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
If I can do it

233
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
I swear I'll catch him

234
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Well then

235
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
One more thing

236
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Yes

237
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,199
I forgot to ask you if you knew how your husband and Mr schuevault first met each other

238
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
Oh that

239
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
It seems they met in the forest

240
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
The forest

241
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:37,439
Yes they met in the forest back when Mr shoe ball could still see it was a total coincidence

242
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,487
What were they doing in a place like that

243
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,791
They were both their bird watching

244
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:48,191
After they meant they went to the forest together all the time

245
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
Bird watching

246
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
More like a happy kid

247
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
Red poetry to Mr shoe vald

248
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Friends

249
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,583
Hey buddy you okay

250
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,447
Yeah I'm fine thanks that guy was driving like an idiot

251
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,519
From what I saw look more like he was trying to run you over

252
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
Man what a creep

253
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Dr recvine

254
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
I've re-examined all the evidence

255
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
And what I found out supports what I told you before

256
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,647
Some of the key murder cases that I wasn't able to solve

257
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,231
I'll point to one killer having just one Mot

258
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
There's the voice of God

259
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Murder case

260
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
And the door knock company president

261
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
The accountant murder case

262
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
Look at the three of them

263
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
They're all extremely different

264
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
The methods in which they were committed for example

265
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,431
And the victims were related to each other

266
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
None of them even knew each other

267
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
However

268
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,831
I have discovered that all of them shared one common Bond

269
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,671
There was a man who connected all the victims

270
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,743
And because they knew him they were all murdered

271
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,351
Every one of them was killed to further isolate Mr shoeval

272
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:29,311
There's also another Connection in these cases that's rather curious in the door knock company president case

273
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,711
His secretary said there was a certain young man who was supposed to meet with Mr gauch right before he was murdered

274
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
And in the voice of God cases under I have heard the voice of God this name was scrawled there by the murderer

275
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,927
And then there's the spirit a couple murder case

276
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:49,023
Since both of them drowned that case seem to be unrelated to the others

277
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,423
But the name of the killer given by the Japanese Doctor Who was the only witness in that case was the same

278
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,239
It was the same name in every case

279
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
Yohan

280
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:07,967
I've been in touch with the former student of mine who's now a renowned criminal psychologist he interviewed a murderer who claim

281
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
And he committed his crimes on his friends orders

282
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
In here he wrote that friend's name

283
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:19,232
And the name that's in this letter is Johan

284
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
Johann is a common name but based on what you found it's also possible that all these cases could

285
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Would be related

286
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:33,056
If by chance you're findings are true this Johan has been systematically murdering people for the past 4 years

287
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:39,712
I can't help but wonder why this man known as Johann is trying to force you've all into complete isolation

288
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,112
Oddly enough Margo Langer the woman who bore you both suck conveniently died as well

289
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:52,512
And there was that young student who was pretending to be shoe Ball's son he conveniently killed himself

290
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
As soon as he made his claim if Yohan really does exist I wonder where he is right now

291
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
No perhaps he's close

292
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:16,320
An the weather

293
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,048
He's right next to shoe volt
