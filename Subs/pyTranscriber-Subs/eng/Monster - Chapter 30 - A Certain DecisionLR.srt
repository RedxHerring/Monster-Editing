1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,864
Our brother has answered his call and gone home to the heavens

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,656
What lies here in this casket

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,960
Is nothing more than the physical shell

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,728
Richard Brown

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,032
We know his soul has been set free

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,080
It will go on and live forever

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,128
Let us Embrace his memory

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,200
Remembering that wherever his family will be

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,016
This loving father and hard-working husband

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,832
Will always be wearing Spirit too

11
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,880
After he had risen from the dead

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,696
The Lord said it doesn't make any sense

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
I just left so much unfinished

14
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
I'm shocked that no one from the police force is here

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
Richard was an excellent Det

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,704
Stupid not one of them came to pay their respects

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
It's ironic about

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,288
Drinking on duty cost him his career

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,616
And in the end the drunken fall is what custom is life

20
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,176
At least that's what the police report said

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,224
His voice was so alive when he

22
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:56,064
He was very excited about seeing his daughter but he never quite made

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,880
Spirit has planted in each of us

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,416
Immort

25
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:08,608
I ask myself for me did I really do everything I could to help poor Richard why of course you did Doctor

26
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
I just sat there listening to him Spilled Out his life to me and I told him he was well on his way to making a full recovery

27
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
I was wrong I feel like I never did enough to help him

28
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,992
10 min is the key if we could question

29
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,344
We might get the answers to help us solve all of this I do believe you're right

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,416
I think there's something we both know doctor

31
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:39,072
This wasn't an accident or a suicide as you said a few hours before his death Richard was on the

32
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,912
Phone happily talking to his daughter he wanted to see her

33
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Doctor you did all that you could and you would help them Richard and quit drinking and was on the

34
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
Road to recovery

35
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
Whatever happened

36
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
It wasn't your fault

37
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
Listen to this

38
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
You weren't going to believe it

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
I'm serious

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,304
I found out my husband's having an affair

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
So I can fronted him and now he won't even speak to me he just washes the car cleans the garage and gives me

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Silent treatment

43
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
I know he's avoiding me it's so obvious

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,944
I wait up for him to come to bed but he falls asleep in his chair besides being blonde and beautiful what she got that I

45
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,576
Doctor are you listening to me of course please

46
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Continue

47
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
Now here's the part you were just not going to believe

48
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:17,536
I decided to confront this other woman so I go over to her place and what do you think she said for me

49
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
Homicide

50
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
No not a chance doc it was an unlucky accident Richard Brown was alone that evening when he went up

51
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,639
To the roof of building number 12 at Munich University

52
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:37,759
He polished off a bottle of whiskey and he got so drunk he fell off the roof end of story

53
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
The bottle

54
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,087
Did you ever thoroughly examined

55
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
Yes

56
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
Of course we did and we found Richard's prints on

57
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
If you don't mind

58
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
Could I see that bottle

59
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
Why yeah sure I suppose

60
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
But it's all in pieces

61
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
Oh Richard

62
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,415
I think there's something we both know doctor as you said a few hours before his death Richard was on the phone

63
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
Happily talking to his daughter he wanted to see her

64
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Yeah

65
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
The guy in this picture was definitely in here that night

66
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
Was he alone

67
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,743
I'm not sure I really don't remember

68
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,375
So you remember that he was here but you don't recall if he was here with someone or alone

69
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
It was him he had a cup of coffee

70
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,007
Coffee yeah that's the reason I remember

71
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,823
Most folks ordered drinks with alcohol when they come here

72
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
So tell me

73
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,015
Is there a chance this young man was with him that night

74
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
I really couldn't tell

75
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,719
You're not even trying look I told you I don't know we got tons of customers who come into this place Mister but like I told

76
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,535
The cops I think the coffee guy did buy a bottle of

77
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
I got a receipt

78
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,679
Are you sure it was Richard who bought that bottle I told you I don't remember

79
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,263
All I know for sure is on that receipt there's a cheap bottle of whiskey

80
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Wait

81
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
What did you just say

82
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,807
Like this one a fifth of blended whiskey

83
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,951
I can't believe it

84
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,791
Why didn't it hit me when I saw that bottle at the police station

85
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
Have you been drinking again

86
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
Well

87
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Just a little

88
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
So what do you drink

89
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Scotch

90
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
I only drink Scotch

91
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:16,223
So you're stinking up my entire office with the smell of cheap booze cheap booze

92
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
You kidding me

93
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,111
I've never drink cheap rocket if I'm going to drink it's real scotch

94
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
Or nothing else

95
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,791
Richard didn't buy that bottle of whiskey

96
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:49,247
Yohan it must have been

97
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,823
I'm sorry I ever get up period so I

98
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
I don't get off Facebook Spotify

99
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,623
What do you want why did you just try to push me under the tracks

100
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
What the I don't know what you talking about

101
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,423
Hey there old man you got a problem with my friend bad idea

102
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,551
Who told you to push me

103
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
You need to shut up

104
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,815
It's your age old man you should be at home playing with your grandkids

105
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,543
I still want an answer

106
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Speak up why did you try to push me earlier

107
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
I don't know

108
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:09,535
Don't you die trying to pull it over on me somebody asked me to do it

109
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
It was some big guy

110
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
What do you mean a big guy

111
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,751
A guy I met in the subway paid me to push you off the platform and onto the tracks

112
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
He gave me money to do it

113
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
I bought you Scotch single malt

114
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
The really good stuff you liked

115
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:22,495
You deserve it my friend

116
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
It's okay

117
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
You can have a drink now

118
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,879
You Can Count On Me Richard as God is my witness

119
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
I identify the guy who did this

120
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
I swear it

121
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:49,119
Island cover your hands true identity

122
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,015
So listen to this doctor I finally told my husband what I think

123
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,111
I said that his cheating on me is a disease that's festering inside him

124
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,463
Then I told that ape that he's the one who should be sitting here and counseling not me

125
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Did you hear what I said

126
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Why yes

127
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
I did

128
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Go ahead

129
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Well then tell me

130
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:29,311
Is my husband keeps this up I feel like my depression is only going to get worse isn't it

131
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Well no

132
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,663
I don't believe you really clinically depressed at all

133
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
Honestly I'm more concerned about your husband's actions than I am with your mental state we must find out why he's giving you

134
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,695
Silent treatment doesn't know which end is up

135
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,999
Please doctor I beg of you

136
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,071

00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:33,823
Oh and there's one more thing yesterday you forgot to lock the stairwell door to our office again

145
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
Wait I did it again I'm sorry I almost forgot today too I can't believe it have a nice evening

146
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Hello

147
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Dr Gillen

148
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
It's Dr Reich

149
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
I saw today's paper

150
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,031
Why yes I saw your newspaper at in there

151
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,359
Let's talk about our memories of cheating

152
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Rudy

153
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,039
So you really think of Dr 10 Masis this message in the paper that he will try to get in touch with us

154
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Contact me

155
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
I ordered it so it would be something that only he and I

156
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
I see

157
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Now

158
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
Please don't make any moves until we hear from

159
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Understood

160
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,447
But there's still one related matter that I need to investigate

161
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
What's that

162
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,567
This prostitute who pretended to be Margo Langer just might have answers

163
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,223
I'm following up on something Richard said that prostitute told me that went far and the boy who killed himself

164
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
Went to see her he had a young man accompanying him

165
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
He was a young beautiful guy with blonde hair

166
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Whatever

167
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Please be careful

168
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Oh I will

169
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,839
If I want to get to the bottom of this I'll have to be very cautious

170
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,655
But Richard's memory deserves no less

171
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
Well

172
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
I'll call you later

173
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Oh no

174
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
So a mer

175
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
Today you forget to shut the window

176
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,327
Magalangor hunt never heard of her

177
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,447
Well I understand she goes by the name of Sophie or something like that

178
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,519
Oh yeah so you want that fat old hat

179
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:45,407
Is that what floats your boat cramps no wait it's not like that

180
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,807
Fine make a ride to blocks down the brick building second floor thank you young lady but I know she's

181
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,903
He's not there right now I haven't seen her around in about a week

182
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,463
She probably went to some place that's nicer

183
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:04,863
And where might that be who the hell knows what makes that fat old hat so popular with all you guys

184
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:10,495
My guess is she's with this really rich guy he used to be a regular customer

185
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:16,895
Hey what do you say you give me a child man you must have money and I'm sure I'm more fun than her

186
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
Do you know where she went

187
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
How would I know

188
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
Maybe she went off somewhere with that new customer of

189
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,623
So she has a new client hey

190
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,487
She should know better at her age than to fall for a guy like him he was a large one

191
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
So he was a big man

192
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,863
Oh yeah and I heard he was pretty big downstairs too

193
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,079
Doctor excuse me do you remember me asking you if it would be all right for me to leave early today

194
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Yes I remember that

195
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
You said you needed to leave at 5

196
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
That'll be fine

197
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,503
The only appointment I have left today is Mrs hess's husband

198
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,111
Are you going on a date tomorrow

199
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
Please make sure you lock all the doors

200
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,375
I need to find that prostitute called Sophie who was pretending to be Margo Langer

201
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
And show her this photo

202
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,311
If I can get her to confirm that this Johan was actually with foreign I'll have someone who can testify to that fact

203
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,383
Which would bring me closer to getting to the bottom of this mess

204
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Yes

205
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
Yeah my wife booked a session for me

206
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,855
I buzzed the door please come in

207
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,791
I might have better luck tonight if I go down there and look for Sophia again it's worth a shot

208
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,655
Good evening Dr Reich

209
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
Mr Hess welcome

210
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
What's

211
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
Nice to meet you

212
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
Please sit down

213
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
Hi

214
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:54,175
This is my first time in counseling so well there's nothing to be nervous about

215
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,015
All you need to do is relax we're here to talk about whatever you want

216
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,647
You can rest assured that our conversation will be completely confidential what we talk about stays right here

217
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,695
You won't tell my wife

218
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Of course not

219
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
How have you been feeling lately

220
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
And what is it you worry about

221
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
My worries

222
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,935
Yes yours

223
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
Well my wife

224
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
She found out about my affair

225
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
And your feeling

226
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,175
I feel like I'm a stranger in my own home

227
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,247
I just washed the car and clean up the garage

228
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
That's all I do

229
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Everyday

230
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
Does doing things around the house make you feel better

231
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Not really

232
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,975
And it seems like I hardly ever talk to my wife

233
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
If any more

234
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
Do you want to talk to her but can't find a way to

235
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
Well

236
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
I don't know about that

237
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,191
Well what about the mistress

238
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,055
You know the woman you had an affair with have you two

239
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
I guess so I killed her

240
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,479
I mean I had a dream where I killed

241
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,063
So how often would you say you have those kinds of dreams

242
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
Oh not

243
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Just

244
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
I really don't have many dreams

245
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,047
Guess I did it cuz I was lonely

246
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,215
Is that the reason you chose to have an affair

247
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
No

248
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
It happened after I met him

249
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Met who

250
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,175
I'm at this really beautiful young man

251
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
With blonde hair

252
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:38,367
Before he showed up I felt like I was living

253
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
Underwater no matter how many people I killed even after the wall fell it was as if I was in

254
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:51,167
Dream after that everything was a lot

255
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,567
More real I didn't feel like I was all alone anymore

256
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
Would you like some

257
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,783
Hot tea perhaps

258
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
No thank

259
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
I'm fine

260
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,695
Well I could use some I'm feeling a bit thirsty

261
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,743
You can just wait here

262
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
My secretary is already gone for the day

263
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
She has a date

264
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,175
She already knows how to brew tea

265
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,991
It's too bad she's not here to make it for us

266
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
Hey do

267
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
What is it

268
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
I figure your job's going to be pretty tough

269
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
I mean there's a lot of pressure

270
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
People telling you all about their dreams and secrets incl

271
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,895
Floating ones that you probably don't want to know about you know ones that could get you into trouble

272
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:10,783
Like mine I mean now you have to walk around knowing I'm a hitman

273
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,792
So anyhow

274
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,608
If you want to make amends towards your wife

275
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,752
You you need to start talking with her

276
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:37,408
I hope you forgot to lock that damn door Meredith

277
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:15,808
Wait wait aren't you get out of here

278
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:22,208
Doctor camera I've been watching over you talk to right fine you're still in

279
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,304
Danger you need to get out of here now run
