1
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
Outstanding yes his skills are truly unmatched the aneurysm was in such a delicate

2
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
Location

3
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,056
Yet he clipped it off so effortless

4
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824
IND

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,896
Another perfect operation by the Peerless doctor

6
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,248
I was finally able to observe the genius surgeon at work for myself

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
No I couldn't have done it without your help

8
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
Thank you all very much

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
It's not midday already

10
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,768
Well you know that surgery did go on for almost six straight hours

11
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,584
We don't have any more patience today

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
You should go rest

13
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,864
Mommy where's Daddy what happened to Daddy

14
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
Wake up sleepy head

15
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,776
It's time to wake up after 10 minutes

16
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
Looks like rolls have been rever

17
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,296
It should be a princess like me who's awoken with a gentle kiss

18
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,744
Well I guess you did forget about our date didn't you cancel

19
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,327
I didn't forget

20
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
Yesterday along with his family

21
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
Mr and Mrs leebert

22
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
Appeared to be in fine spirits

23
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
Along with their fraternal twins

24
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,895
The family will remain in dusseldor

25
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
For an unknown period of time

26
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
We'll be following this story

27
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
Great interest

28
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,231
Feel like I'm still so exhausted

29
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Hey wake up

30
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
Look at the TV they're talking about you

31
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,655
But seems to be recovering well after undergoing surgery

32
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,127
Is holding a press conference now we take you there

33
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,527
Mr rosenbach's diagnosis showed a ruptured aneurysm in his cranial artery the operation went smoothly

34
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
Including the successful clipping

35
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
Of the patient cerebral hemorrhage

36
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:24,607
Yes well we will certainly do whatever is necessary for him to be able to sing again

37
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
Isn't that wonderful Kenzo

38
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,247
He wasn't even about me

39
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,087
It was all about your father

40
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,463
But it's only because you did such a wonderful job last night working as part of Father's team

41
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,607
I'm sure he appreciates all your hard work since you're the one responsible for raising the hospital's reputation

42
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
No I'm the one who should be grateful

43
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:04,287
I mean after all it is thanks to your father that I'm actually able to work here in Germany

44
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
Hang in there Kenzo

45
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
If you stick with Father your future is guaranteed

46
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,735
It won't be long before father becomes chairman of the board

47
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,807
Soon after that you'll become chief of surgery

48
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
And then Chief director

49
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,951
Which means I'll be the director's wife

50
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,791
You better make me happy Kenzo cuz hardship doesn't suit me

51
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,863
You still want to go out on that date

52
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
I said we

53
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
Blood pressure 128 over 64

54
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Spatul

55
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,551
I will now scrape the pyramus

56
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
As usual you did a magnificent job doctor Tenma

57
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Thank you very much

58
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
But it seems to me that your talents extend beyond the or

59
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,519
Well you're the head of neurosurgery it's such a young age

60
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,103
You've become the Golden Boy for both the director and the chief of surgery

61
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,943
And on top of that you've even captured the heart of the director's daughter

62
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,039
What exactly are you trying to say doctor sorry

63
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:24,415
I'm not suggesting you've done anything wrong here after all hospitals are ruled by politics

64
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Come on

65
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,279
You do realize that you're being used by the director now don't you Doctor tema

66
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,607
I mean take that amazing surgery you performed on that Opera Sing

67
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
He acted like he performed himself

68
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
Even holding a televised press conf

69
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Well

70
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,823
If he is using you then it must mean that you are gifted

71
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,407
When you do become successful don't forget about Good Old Becker

72
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
I'll buy you a drink next time

73
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
May

74
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Help you

75
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
Are you Dr Tim

76
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
I am

77
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Give me back my husband

78
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,439
Me back my husband tell me just tell me what can you operate on

79
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:34,815
Who are you my husband was dying and he was brought to this emergency room first

80
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,655
He came in long before that stupid opera singer was here

81
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:45,055
But you made him wait to be operated on everyone says you're supposed to be the best surgeon

82
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:51,455
In this entire Hospital

83
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,855
I remember now I was about to start surgery on a Turkish

84
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
The construction accident yes sir you shouldn't be here right now

85
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
Get over to or one immediately these are the directors orders doctor so please hurry

86
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
Why if you had operated on him he would have survived

87
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:23,455
Bring him back to me bring it back

88
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,415
And then my friend and I started fighting over that dress it was the only one they had in that size can you believe that but

89
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Don't worry about it of course it was mine in the end

90
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Hey are you listening

91
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Is there something wrong

92
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
You seem distracted

93
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
I checked the records

94
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,103
And the surgeon who operated on the Turkish man was Dr Becker

95
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
Why are you still talking about that

96
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
If you look back over the charts they clearly show what happened

97
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,551
Becker took too long to treat that man

98
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:04,415
I don't know but I think if I had performed the surgery on him I might have been able to save his life

99
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
Do we have to talk about this at dinner

100
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
But what does she want from me anyway

101
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,631
I was just following orders from the director when I performed surgery on that opera singer

102
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
I'm not responsible

103
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Well am I

104
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
Well of course not

105
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
After all people's lives aren't created equal

106
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:01,503
Is that the house

107
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Yes

108
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
One of the neighbors called in

109
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
How many shots were fire

110
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Five or six sir

111
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
Who lives in this house

112
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
Well it seems

113
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,887
It seems to be the residents of the Levert family who recently fled here from East Germany

114
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,959
This is going to turn into a big mess

115
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,127
I'll charge in there the count of three

116
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,015
Street

117
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,375
There appears to be one Survivor a girl

118
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
A man and a woman are dead a boy is in critical condition I repeat one boy is in critical

119
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
An emergency

120
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,815
A bullet to the head is that boy the only patient

121
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:57,215
Yes his parents were DOA it seems to have been a robbery all right then

122
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
I'm about 5 minutes out I should be there shortly

123
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:10,015
Oh Father

124
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Evening Dr Heineman

125
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,647
I'm terribly sorry for keeping your precious daughter out so late

126
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
What are you talking about Tim

127
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
It's all right Ava is your fiance isn't she

128
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Now

129
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
What are we all doing standing here come in have some tea

130
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:32,799
So tell me something have you notified your parents in Japan about your wedding date yet yes sir

131
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:39,455
But my father runs a small Hospital back home so I'm not sure if he'll be able to take the time and come all the way out here

132
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,855
To Germany well wouldn't it be a good opportunity for him to take some time off and enjoy a Leisure trip overseas

133
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
We're taking care of the expenses anyway

134
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
Thank you very much sir

135
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,047
I'm completely indebted to you for everything you've done for me

136
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,167
Did I ever tell you that when you first arrived here in Germany I thought you were a high school student

137
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,799
And now you're the best young doctor at Eisler Memorial Hospital

138
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:11,455
By the way Kenzo I want to talk to you about your current research on cerebral vascular spasm

139
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
And subarachnoid hemorrhages

140
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:17,087
Oh good I've been creating a model of a subarachnoid hemorrhage in a dog

141
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,903
I'm sorry but I'm going to have to cancel the project

142
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
But sir

143
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,535
I have been asked to speak at the next European Medical conv

144
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,119
And of course that means preparing a sharp presentation

145
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,935
That's why I want to have you compile my manuscript

146
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
Sorry my research is very close to being completed I'm almost finished by the way Eva did I tell you what happened

147
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Later today

148
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
No father you didn't what happened

149
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,527
Not suspicious group of civilians forced their way into the hospital

150
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,367
They were protesting the operation We performed on the opera singer

151
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,231
They claimed we pushed back the case of a Turkish man who'd arrived at the ER first

152
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
They got the whole thing wrong that's not how it happened that Turkish man was operated on first there was

153
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
It's not a thing wrong with our procedures

154
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
Right Tenma

155
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
Yes

156
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,479
Apparently they think we're some kind of Charity or something

157
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,599
Our priority is to progress as medical Scholars before we save lives

158
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Don't you agree

159
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,047
In any case I do want you to work on my manuscript

160
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,887
I have great expectations of you Doctor Tenma

161
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
I appreciate that sir

162
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:11,263
Where's the patience they just brought him in

163
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
How's he holding up blood pressure 72/50 his pulse

164
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,063
At 1:37 the bullet entered through his forehead we need x-rays immediately yes doctor

165
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Oh doctor Tenma

166
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,351
Who's this she's the twin sister of the little boy we just brought in

167
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:41,727
Any injuries no but she seems to sustained a serious psychological shock

168
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
Yes what is it

169
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,207
The boys x-rays in CT scans are ready

170
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,023
I understand I'll be there shortly

171
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
It entered the front of the head

172
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,911
Then stopped deep in the center of the brain yes

173
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,727
This one is definitely going to be difficult

174
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,823
The bullet is touching the left side of the middle cerebral artery

175
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Here

176
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
Will you look at that

177
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
Doctor Tenma is absolutely right

178
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
This one won't be easy

179
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:30,367
If you jostle the bullet even the slightest bit man they artery could rupture and cause a massive hemorrhage

180
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
Hey sorry I'm late Dr Becker you're supposed to be on duty I

181
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
Don't understand how you could be so late

182
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:45,727
Will do a full frontal craniotomy and remove the bone fragments and contaminated brain matter

183
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,287
Then we'll remove the bullet very carefully

184
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,103
And lastly repair the arterial wall

185
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,247
But with a little hard work and some luck I'm certain that we can pull it off

186
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
Blood pressure 120 over

187
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
Pulse 92

188
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
He's looking good

189
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
The anesthesia is taking effect

190
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,447
Oh there you are doctor yes

191
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
You shouldn't be here

192
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,311
You're needed in operating room 1 immediately

193
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,687
It's critically urgent mayor rudiger has suffered a cerebral blood clot

194
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,783
He's being transported here by helicopter

195
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,599
They're scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes then

196
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,719
I think the best thing is to contact Dr Boyer there's a chance his carotid artery is blocked

197
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,535
If that's the case we want you to operate on him

198
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,935
But sir I can't do that I was just about to begin surgery on that young boy yeah

199
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,055
It's an order from the director

200
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
Hello this is Tenma

201
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Hello tema

202
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
Take care of the mayor will you

203
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,135
I've contacted Dr Eisen and Dr Boyer

204
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
It'll be good to have that extra

205
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Support in case you need it

206
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,815
But Dr heinemann I was about to start another operation right now

207
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,119
Just let Dr Becker take over that one

208
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
With all due respect sir the patient I'm about to operate on has a bullet up against his left middle cerebral

209
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,127
Ordering it could turn into a very complex surgery

210
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,943
But I am confident I can save him director

211
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
So I'm going to let Dr boy or take care of

212
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:42,207
I'm expecting you to do everything in your power to save the mayor

213
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
You need to understand something very important in the next review of medical facilities the mayor has promised our

214
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,191
Spindle a very generous increase in funds

215
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,751
We can't have him die just yet

216
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
Do you understand

217
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,847
I'm expecting you will do this

218
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,663
I'm counting on you Doctor Tenma

219
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
Yes sir

220
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:12,159
The mayor has just arrived on the heliport doctor

221
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,231
After the CT scans are done do the angiogram

222
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,375
We need to confirm where the arteries blocked

223
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,495
About time to get ready Dr timma

224
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,383
Yeah we're all counting on those brilliant skills of yours

225
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
Apparently they think we're some kind of Charity or something

226
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,903
Our priority is to progress as medical Scholars before we save lives

227
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,303
10 my don't you agree but what does she want from me anyway I was just following orders from the

228
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,399
I'm not responsible

229
00:20:54,655 --> 00:21:00,799
Well am I after all people's lives aren't created equal

230
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:07,199
Bring it back if you had operated on him you wouldn't Sur

231
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Well

232
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,560
Is something the matter doctor Tenma

233
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
I have

234
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,288
I have a surgery to perform in the other room

235
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,664
Hey where are you going Dr tema

236
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,064
But this is an order from the director

237
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,464
Reading room on my way

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,264
Hang in there kid I'll save you

239
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,664
No matter what
