00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
He works the stock market like a marionette

29
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
One phone call from him leaves Banks across Germany quaking in their boots they call him the Howard Hughes

30
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Bavaria

31

He has no family no close friends it's just him and his money his fortune keeps growing and growing every year

32
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
On Earth is he spend it on anyway

34
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,224
I didn't even get to the weird part yet

35
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,808
Other nickname is the vampire of Bavaria

36
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
How come just as the clock strikes 2 a.m.

37
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,536
Like a hearse and whisk him off into the night

38
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,375
I've seen it myself something out of a horror movie

39
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
Maybe he's getting some air

40
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,751
I'll find out soon enough what else you've all up to

41
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
What do you mean you're going to find out

42
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
It's for my research paper silly

43
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,735
Mental activities of medieval and present-day Financial figures of Bavaria

44
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
I lucked out she was all the gold mine

45
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
So you look me up cuz he yelled at me is that it

46
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,975
Just your name and your major I'm not a snoop

47
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,047
Anyway I wouldn't lose any sleep over him chewing you out

48
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
He yells at all the guys who read to him

49
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Yeah

50
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
Well I guess it's a good thing I'm used to getting yelled at

51
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
What do you mean

52
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,127
It's just I spent a lot of time in foster homes some of them weren't so nice

53
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,735
So that's why there's no record of you at any of the local high schools

54
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,295
You looked up more than my major in name

55
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
It's got to be rough

56
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
Growing up without your real parents like that

57
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
The truth is

58
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,815
I came to Munich for school because I thought maybe I could find my mother

59
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
That's great

60
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
Have you seen her yet

61
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
No

62
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
It wasn't meant to be

63
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
What do you mean

64
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
You just throw in the towel

65
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,639
Hey you don't happen to know your mom's name

66
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Well go ahead

67
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991

68
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Come on tell me

69
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855

No

75
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679

We are reading pains

83
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
Why didn't you explain Carl

84
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
If only I had known

85
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,127
Now I understand why you gave up looking

00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,015
I'm so sorry for your loss I already said that it doesn't matter didn't I

87

That's sweet of you but I'm fine

90
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071

There is no way

99
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
In any case

100
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839
Listen up Bishop gropius one of the founders of our school wrote this poem in the year 1502 that much

101

On the second to the last big year

104
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,055

How do you figure

113
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Listen

114
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
The Big Year means leap year

And the only leap years left in this Century are this year and the year 2000 he will arrive upon the

00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
Maybe this isn't such a good idea

134
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
You're probably right this is no place for a girl you should go home only beautiful things are deserving

135
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Of my love

136

Why does he come here to see you in the middle of the night like he does

149
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
It's simple kid I make him feel better

150
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:48,191
But not in the way you're thinking just cuz he's up at this hour doesn't mean he's up at this hour if you catch my

And why shouldn't he

153
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:01,503
When I finally went to shoe volt and told him who I was he broke down crying and apologized on the spot

154
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,111
I had his son and he threw me out on the street like I was a piece of trash

155
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647

00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
Yeah he came to see me a little while back told me the same sob story you did

179
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,351
No way it can't be

180
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:58,751
Excuse me if I don't take your word for it

181
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:05,151
For the record I think you're both full of it so this other guy who is he another student

182
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
A bunch of you take turns reading books to shoe ball the different boy every day of the week ain't that right

183
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
You've got that in common Carl yes sir I think he's the Thursday

184
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,999
Day boy

185
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,143
You could have insisted a little harder that you're his real son

186
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
What's the point

187
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,775
I was passed along from foster home to foster home from most of my life

188
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Usually sending me from bad to worse

189
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,711
But I finally ended up with a couple who loved me as though I were there very own

190
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
They're everything I ever could have wanted

191
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,135
But they're being so wonderful made me want to meet my biological father even more

192
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,487
I thought that if I could see what a sad little man he was with my own eyes

193
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,303
I could finally return my foster parents love

194
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
That's all

195
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
I was trying to do

196
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,847
Hey Lotte tell me something have you ever seen this Thursday boy

197
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,151
That's one day of the week I always have off from work

198
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
But this one Thursday I went in to grab something I'd forgotten

199
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
And he was there reading right

200
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Tell me what he looked like

201
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Let me think

202
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,719
I want to say he had blonde hair in a very beautiful face

203
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
Who is he

204
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,079
Someone in this University

205
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,383
Is pretending to be me

206
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:47,039
Carl are you listening to me this is important take this money

207
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
What about you Mom

208
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,559
Honey I already told you I can't go with you

209
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:05,215
But how come are you in trouble I don't want to go alone mom you have

210
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
No choice if you stay with me they'll call you off to some orphanage around here people will mock you was the son of a w****

211
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:19,295
Now go on what about my dad can't my dad make it better somehow his name

212
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
My name is hanske York Schubert isn't it

213
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:27,999
Who told you that old Mrs Bella from across the street my dad's riches and he

214
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,351
He said he abandoned us how come you would do something like that

215
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:40,031
He didn't abandon us Carl

216
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,431
No just go where he is and you can find us there no you can't so when can I see him

217
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,831
Oh Carl when you're all grown up you can meet your father if you want

218
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,415
You hate him if he turns you away please

219
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:03,071
Why shouldn't I because

220
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
Mommy doesn't hate him even now

221
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:15,615
Keep this with you always

222
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:22,271
It was a gift from your father on the day you were born

223
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
Carl I know who he is

224
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,207
Earth to Carl I know who the Thursday boy is what

225
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
His name is Edmund for

226
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
He's a philosophy major

227
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,215
I'm sure he's the guy we're looking for he reads books to shuvall that the Mansion every Thursday

228
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
Edwin Farrah

229
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Get ready

230
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,199
You should be coming out of that lecture hall any second

231
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
Hey

232
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,855
You wouldn't happen to know Edmund foreign would you

233
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
Oh

234
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
Hey guys is Edmund here

235
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
Who had been foreign

236
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,023
I think he was a no-show today

237
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
There you go

238
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Oh

239
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
Okay so he dodged the bullet today

240
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
But seriously

241
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,127
It's only a matter of time before we give that fraud what's coming to him

242
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,455
No imposter's going to cheat you out of shoe balls inheritance

243
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
It's not about the money

244
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:32,415
I couldn't care less if I see any part of his fortune no if they want to Rob shuvall

245
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
Fine they can go right ahead

246
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Who cares

247
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
Then why

248
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Because

249
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,935
Because I can't stand the thought of this bastard far and pretending to be my mother's son there's no forgiving something like that

250
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,943
With the pedals of your silk flowers swaying in the breeze

251
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,015
The Cry of the Mockingbird rang through my heart

252
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,767
You haven't told me to stop reading yet

253
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
Why is that sir I berate you all the time why do you insist

254
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
I'm coming back

255
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:22,591
Here's the money that good that isn't why

256
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,223
With all due respect sir it's nothing like that

257
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,295
Is money the only incentive to do something in your world

258
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
In my world or any other

259
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
What are they

260
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
Your parents

261
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,351
Actually I was raised by a series of foster families

262
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
Forgive me for praying

263
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,727
Would you meet your real parents if you could

264
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
Well sir

265
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
Actually

266
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,759
I'm yes this young man who reads to me just may be the one I've wait

267
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
It for

268
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,855
It doesn't seem to be after my money

269
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Who is he

270
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,463
Never mind I'm talking to myself

271
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
It's time we called it a day Norman

272
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,935
Oh one more thing

273
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,519
Regarding your Latin boy

274
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
It is much improved

275
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,503
Well thank you very much sir

276
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,975
Looks like Edmund fahren's playing hooky today too

277
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,815
Pictures laid up in bed with a bad cold or something like that

278
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
Tomorrow's Thursday he'll be there

279
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,447
He'll be at the mansion in so will I

280
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,335
Oh I get it you're going to bust him as the faker he is right in front of you right

281
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
That's awesome

282
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
Let's go get him already

283
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
He was supposed to be here an hour ago

284
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,695
If you were sick and stuck in bed at least then we would know where to find him

285
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
Hey

286
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
I want to barge into his room and confront him there

287
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
Hold on

288
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,887
Don't tell me you looked up Florence address

289
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
202

290
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
204 jackpot

291
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
Here we go

292
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
It's been so Grim around here

293
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,000
The whole school's talking about what happened to Edmund foreign

294
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,168
The school paper actually printed a suicide note didn't they

295
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,496
I can no longer continue to deceive

296
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
So that's what it was about

297
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
I guess so

298
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,968
Spending all that time with you all to acting like his son maybe the guilt just blindsided him

299
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:45,344
I've been known he was going to grow a conscience he'd have been better off not trying in the first place

300
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Lot

301
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
Yesterday must have been tough

302
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Hey

303
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Don't you know it

304
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,448
Since we're the ones who discovered the body the police held us for questioning all day

305
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,520
Well I didn't end up reading today after all

306
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,080
Mr schewald is taking the news very hard

307
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,944
Hey I'm being rude this is Carl he's the Friday reader

308
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
