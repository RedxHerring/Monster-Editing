1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:06,656
Are you okay Mina

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,056
He was taking and drag down these very steps they took him away who was

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,360
My big brother

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:22,272
Yes he was called the man of red rose Mansion I believe

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
What was his real name

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:30,208
It was Franz Bonaparte I see Bonaparte however I'm not

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
Not certain if that was his actual name bonaparta was also known to have a pseudonym why would he

8
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
Well you see he was also the author of a children's book

9
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
I was reading a picture book in here

10
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
Someone came back home

11
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
Children's book that's right it was a strange picture book

12
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:08,608
It was called the nameless monster

13
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
This summer is real I've been

14
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
Before I was reading a picture book sitting here by myself the one who

15
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
Open the door and came back it's me

16
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,000
How could that be

17
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,048
It was greeting myself

18
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,704
Welcome home

19
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
You're looking for young souk's mother

20
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,448
Well then mrsook is right down the hall in room 409

21
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:27,104
I'm sorry to say the poor deers memory comes and goes in spurts

22
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
You'll have to be patient with her

23
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Is that you dear

24
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
No

25
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,432
Oh my what a beautiful girl are you one of y'all's Little Friends

26
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
That's right

27
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
You've brought such pretty flowers

28
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
I'll put them right here how about that

29
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,184
I have to be very careful so my Aunt Olga doesn't take them

30
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,280
She's always coming around poking into my things and taking what she wants

31
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,887
She was in here yesterday and when I turned my back she took my favorite doll

32
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,703
Well she sounds perfectly horrid

33
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,799
But I think she passed away over 10 years ago now don't you remember that

34
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
That's right

35
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,407
I'm surprised at how much you know

36
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
I've heard a lot from young man

37
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
I see

38
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
Where is he is it a school day

39
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Of course

40
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
He's already finished with that

41
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
He's a detective

42
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,303
Everything's fine your Yawn is all right there's nothing to worry about

43
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
I like talking to you

44
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,447
You have a sweet face and very kind eyes

45
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,751
You can tell me about anything you want

46
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
Whatever you can remember

47
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
Well let me think

48
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,735
And knows what the latest fashion trend will be even before

49
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
This is so much fun it's been a while since I've had such a good time

50
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
I'm glad to hear

51
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,535
I must think of a way to thank you for your visit

52
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,935
You don't need to do that actually though I was really hoping that you would show me that thing that John recently and

53
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,127
Yes like I said tape of course I remember there it is

54
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,511
It never would have occurred to me that you would have sent them to soak's mother

55
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:58,399
It shouldn't take very long I'll wait here while you go in and collect the tape and the documents

56
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
Make sure you don't forget about our arrangement

57
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Remember we did make a deal

58
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Come on

59
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
Let's get going Dr Tem

60
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,367
I'm sorry that I said before this had nothing to do with you doctor

61
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,487
No words can describe how I felt when you told me everything that you've been through

62
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
The last 10 years must have been horrible for you

63
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,447
But this cassette tape maybe the key to unlocking the whole story and you'll be able to prove your innocent

64
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
When that happens your entire life will change for the better

65
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
But Mr Grimmer

66
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
What about your life

67
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759
Well well it is true that I've been on a mission to investigate 511 kinderheim and what it did to the children

68
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
The truth is

69
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,623
Even if it all becomes clear

70
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
It won't lead to any big changes in my life

71
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,143
So your friends of Mr Sook and came to check up on his mother

72
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,959
At the moment she seems to be doing quite well

73
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Good

74
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:11,871
You know I think the conversation she had with her other visitor today really helped to lift her spirits

75
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
Father visitor

76
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
What was their name

77
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,039
I don't know all I remember is she was a beautiful long-haired blonde

78
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
You actually did come

79
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,239
I was told to expect you shortly and here you are

80
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
The tape where is it

81
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,871
Let me see

82
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
I want to know how Young's doing

83
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
At the moment

84
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
He's

85
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,671
Take me to the hospital where I can see you on

86
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,511
My Yawn is in big trouble isn't he

87
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,143
My mind is alert and has been very clear since that pretty girls visit

88
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
Talking to her reawaken my memories

89
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,775
But it might only last through the day

90
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
Please let me see Yon

91
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
I will take you

92
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
To the hospital

93
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
Where you can see your son

94
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Just took trimmer

95
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,167
Turns out the secret police are willing to make a deal with us

96
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Mother you're here

97
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
Oh

98
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,271
Why didn't you call me so I could have come sooner

99
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
I'm really all right

100
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Nothing

101
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Nothing at all

102
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
You're making light of it to try to keep me for Mooring aren't you dear just like you did the last time

103
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
The last time

104
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:18,847
I was so worried but you kept pretending nothing was wrong and walked around claiming you felt just fine

105
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:25,247
But you had badly sprained your ankle

106
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:31,391
Dear God please don't ever take him from my mind

107
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
Everyday my mind slips a bit more

108
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
So many things are fading away Lord let me remember my son is the best

109
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
Child and mother ever had

110
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
What is it that you are the most afraid of

111
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
A monster

112
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Getting

113
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Gob

114
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
That's enough

115
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
I don't want to hear anymore

116
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
Regardless you should listen to this

117
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,783
The nephew that you ended up sending to 511 kinderheim went through the same experience as this boy who was drugged

118
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
And interrogated on tape

119
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,671
You should know what that experience entailed you need to hear this

120
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,743
I only listen to this far into it the other day

121
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,327
We need to hear more to get the full picture of what happened

122
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
Let's continue on

123
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
But I'm most afraid of

124
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
For getting on

125
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,991
Strange lessons we have every day

126
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
Making my

127
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Please

128
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
Don't make me forget Ann

129
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
It's only Anna and

130
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Give me that

131
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
So I can allow you to hear

132
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
I don't understand who's this young man talking on the tape what did he do did he erase the rest of the old record

133
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,183
I finally figured it out he didn't erase

134
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
Did the person who visited souk's mother before record this

135
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
Whose voice is it I know this

136
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
That's what you want sounds like today where I must go

137
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,527
I finally figured it out Dr denma

138
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
He's on vacation

139
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
That workaholic

140
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
I can't believe

141
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
It's his first vacation since he started working here

142
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Well

143
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
It's not like we're especially busy right now

144
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,727
Even for an elite officer of the bka

145
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
He pushed himself too hard

146
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
He just doesn't know his limits

147
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
His wife and daughter left him because of that

148
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
So where's the inspector spending is vacation anyway

149
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,391
He said something about Prague in the Czech Republic but I wonder if he even knows how to relax

150
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:21,791
What would you like to drink sir

151
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:28,191
Just coffee very well wait a minute I'm forgetting that I'm on vacation

152
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
Make it a beer

153
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
What kind of beer is this waiter

154
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,151
You actually believe this investigative report will satisfy the public

155
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,783
We don't know where detective soup is and we can't prove that the checkoslovakian secret police are involved

156
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,623
If we release these Half Baked results the media will eat Us Alive

157
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,487
There's a problem all the people who would have been able to help us with this are dead now

158
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,143
Blaming the dead doesn't let us off the hook it's not that simple the public demands that we do a complete investig

159
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,495
Yes sir if you understand then go uncover something

160
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
And while you're at it find detective suit

161
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Immediately

162
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,687
Yes sir whoops excuse me

163
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,759
Oh there's someone here who would like to meet with you chief

164
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,831
You know I don't see anybody without an appointment

165
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
Besides now it's just not the right

166
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
But I will

167
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Inspector

168
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,031
Well hell this certainly is a surprise inspector Lungi

169
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
We met each other at the Interpol conf

170
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,967
I remember we had a very interesting conversation and I was extremely impressed with the lecture that you gave

171
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
I'm sorry to be interrupting you with such a busy time

172
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
Don't worry about it it was nice you drop by on your vacation

173
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
I am a bit envious though

174
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,023
Due to the present situation here I doubt I'll even get away on a break

175
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
Congratulations new chief nepala

176
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,887
You must be very busy you said

177
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,703
If you don't mind I'd like to ask your advice

178
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
The case we're currently working on has grown into

179
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
Big Tang

180
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
Mess

181
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,687
It involves a connection between the Prague station and the former Czechoslovakian secret police

182
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:53,087
It all began when an inspector named Simon was found murdered along with Renegade members of the secret police

183
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
We thought had been disbanded years ago

184
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
At the time inspector zaiman had been conducting a murder investigation the victim had been running an un

185
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Registered orphanage

186
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,191
We found out afterwards both Zaman and the orphanage director had ties to the secret police

187
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
This all happened before I took charge of this division

188
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,567
Do you have any leads on the murderer

189
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
A man named Grimmer who discovered the orphanage director's body has surfaced as the leading suspect but the children

190
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,551
Someone else leaving the crime scene immediately after the incident happened

191
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
Who's the other person

192
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
A pretty blonde woman

193
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,511
That was just the beginning this case has expanded

194
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Here's what we do know

195
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,887
The former station Chief and two of his veteran detectives were found murder

196
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Killed with poison candies

197
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:47,359
As it turns out those three dead officers were involved with the Czechoslovakian secret police as well do you know who gave

198
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
Then the poison candies

199
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,991
We suspect a young detective named young souk who reported directly to Z

200
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
Do you have any proof

201
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
No I'm afraid we have nothing conclusive

202
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,927
But two detectives recently assigned to this division by a special investigative task

203
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,255
Force were found shot to death and detective suits

204
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
Very interesting

205
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,863
So where's detective soup now

206
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,167
Right now is whereabouts are unknown

207
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
The circumstantial evidence all points directly to so

208
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
But you're wondering if he has a sufficient motive

209
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
Yes that's true

210
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,431
And he's not the kind of man who would normally commit such a crime

211
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
Yes but

212
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,271
How do you know what kind of man is

213
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,599
Let's just say that I know of a very similar case

214
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:37,279
I'm impressed even while on vacation your hand tells me you're focused on work

215
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:46,751
You know how to objectively a mass data I remember when listening to your lecture I was impressed when you said you can

216
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
Perform a completely subjective investigation and at the same time that you somehow get into the head of the killer in

217
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Can we try it

218
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:01,087
If you were sick what would you be thinking and where would you be right now inspector knowing that law enforcement is looking for you

219
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
I'm sorry but I just can't

220
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,975
I'm on vacation I need time off for myself

221
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,303
Oh please forgive me I should be apologizing to you

222
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,703
So are you enjoying our beautiful city I've been visiting second-hand book shops

223
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Something in particular

224
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,287
Yes and I searched 13 stores for it

225
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,359
But I finally came across one that had it

226
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
Actually I came here today to ask if you could translate this check into German when you had some free time but it appears as though

227
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Too busy

228
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
Oh I see it's a picture book

229
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,743
I'm surprised I never would have imagined you were into such things

230
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,327
Leave it with me I'll have one of my officers translated by tomorrow

231
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Who is it for

232
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
Your child or maybe a grandchild

233
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:53,311
Well yes I suppose it would be something like that

234
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
Hey Suk is an honest guy

235
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,455
As his friend I believe without a doubt that he is completely innocent

236
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:06,111
Look the police already asked me a whole bunch of questions but I know he's not guilty no matter what they're trying to imply

237
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
If you're in law enforcement you've got to help him make them listen to you if it will do you any good we'll give you as much information as we can

238
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,351
Unfortunately I'm only here on a vacation

239
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,911
So my influence is rather Limited

240
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
Were there any other people he was particularly close to

241
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
He was working on getting his girl to go out with him

242
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,783
Yeah but so far he'd only gotten her to give him her name hey do you remember what it was Anna

243
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,183
Yeah that's right her name was Anna Liebert she had blonde hair and she was dropped dead gorgeous

244
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:47,583
He was really happy he thought things between them were going pretty well

245
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,983
Anna Liebert one of the twins that survive on the East German Diplomat and his family

246
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:59,103
They were murdered 10 years ago

247
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,967
I don't think there's anything left now

248
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,879
I remember that Amy will share base the nameless monster was one of the books we published years ago but

249
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:16,767
If it was published during the old regime that would have been before I became president of this Publishing House

250
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,839
Is it possible that a meal share Bay was a pen name

251
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
You're right matter of fact I believe it was

252
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
Come to think of it he had other pen names as well

253
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
It was something bonaparta

254
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
Jacob farrobeck and

255
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
I think Klaus Pope

256
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
Klaus Pope's Box is right here

257
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,783
Oh you found something that's a surprise may I open it

258
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
Sure go right ahead

259
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,647
I'm sure it's all just a mountain of old sketches anyway

260
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,199
A pregnant woman

261
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,343
And she gave birth

262
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
To a girl

263
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,800
They were twins

264
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
I see

265
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,688
You were able to get a translated for me

266
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
Thank you Chief NE

267
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
I do appreciate

268
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,576
Oh there's something I've been wondering about

269
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:50,976
If you don't mind could you do me one more favor and read the last paragraph of the book to me now

270
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,048
At last he had found a

271
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,376
But there was no longer anyone around to call him by

272
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Such a

273
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Joh

274
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,088
I never thought to ask but how long is your vacation you there cancel the beer and

275
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
Make that a coffee instead

276
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,024
I think it's going to be a long vacation
