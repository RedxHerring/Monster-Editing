1
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,632
How are you feeling Mr Yonkers everything okay

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,448
So

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,776
Tell me Mr Yonkers are you able to recognize me

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,336
Do you see this finger I'm holding up

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,664
How about it

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
Can you talk to me today

7
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
What's that

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,696
I'm sorry

9
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
What did you say

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,864
Coming

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,448
Mr Yonkers what's coming

12
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,872
Monsters

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,992
The monster

14
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Younkers

15
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
I know you're able to speak

16
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
You have been identified at the scene of the crime

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
A four murders

18
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,976
Involving middle-aged couples in the past 2 years

19
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
There's no point denying

20
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,376
What do you say will speak up Mr yunkers

21
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,872
All right okay I guess we had better tell you that we already know that you are just a lock pick

22
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,176
Your job is strictly undoing locks

23
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
You couldn't have possibly slit their throats in one single slash with such cold blooded Grace Yonkers no

24
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
That wasn't your work

25
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,744
Now that means there had to be other accomplices involved

26
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,608
And I'm thinking there would have had to have been at least three of you in order to do both

27
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Open a strong lock

28
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
And murder a middle-aged couple

29
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Without resistance

30
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
That sound about right

31
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
We're almost through compiling a list of suspects who we already know are skillful with knives it's only a matter of time

32
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
Time before we're able to narrow it down to one name

33
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,832
Whether you decide to cooperate with us or not

34
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:43,744
However I must confess that's not really what I wanted to ask you about

35
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
What I would really like to know Mr Yonkers is why four couples from across Germany and every one of the couples

36
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,312
Middle aged and without children money and items were stolen but we know the amounts were too small to

37
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
Define murdering for a mere third of it

38
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
All right

39
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
So tell me are you up for some negotiation

40
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,624
If you confess now will dismiss all charges against you

41
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
So tell me who is the person who hired you to do this

42
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
Mr Yonkers it's all right it's all right

43
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
I don't think so we're almost there get out of

44
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
Very well but I'll be coming back at a later time and just to make sure he isn't poisoned or that he doesn't

45
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
Pier I will assign a guard to watch him closely that shouldn't strike

46
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,823
They're always seems to be so much trouble happening all around you Dr Tenma

47
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,223
We'll keep in touch

48
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
Hey hold on where are you going

49
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,399
Just going out for a walk it's not supposed to leave the room without permission

50
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,215
Patients need to get fresh air every so often

51
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
We're just going out into the garden

52
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
You're welcome to come with us if you like officer

53
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
Very

54
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
It's nice and warm out here today

55
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
You are able to talk aren't you

56
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,911
It's afternoons like this one that make you happy to be alive you know

57
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,007
If it weren't for times like today I don't think I'd be able to go on

58
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,359
Especially when you're here constantly seeing people having to fight for their lives

59
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:13,247
That's why it's easier for some doctors to think about their money their research or getting prom

60
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
I used to be one of those guys myself

61
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,671
I wanted to get promoted and do my own research

62
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,279
I was positive that being successful in surgery was the weight of the top

63
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,375
But have to performing a surgery on a certain little boy

64
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Everything changed for me

65
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
He was the older of twin siblings

66
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Been shot in the head

67
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,407
Saving his life reminded me why I had become a doctor in the first place

68
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,271
It reminded me that all human lives should be regarded as equal

69
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
And that a doctor's job is to save those lives

70
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
Thank you

71
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
People start over all the time

72
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,935
It's never too late believe me

73
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
You know something

74
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
You and I are very close in age

75
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
Well you're almost like a father to me

76
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,647
Doctor you saved my life and you've protected me

77
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
That's why it almost feels like you're my father

78
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,303
Well it looks like I landed myself one big kid huh

79
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
This one time when I was a little boy

80
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
I wanted this clock

81
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
You

82
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
I'm sure you've seen those before

83
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
Kind of have a little Nutcracker figuring popping out of it every hour

84
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:50,015
I would stare at it for a long time pressing my face against that display window at the store every afternoon

85
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,391
So I guess it's no surprise doctor that was the first lock I ever picked in my life

86
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
But I was caught in the act

87
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
And I never got that clock

88
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
However

89
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,911
Ever since that day picking locks sort of became my job

90
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,263
And it all started just because I wanted that stupid clock

91
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
All I wanted was that stupid clock

92
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
You should just tell them everything

93
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
Tell the police everything you know

94
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
Just make a fresh start of

95
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Oh my friends

96
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Who did it

97
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
Is it this monster

98
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
The one that you mentioned before

99
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:01,695
Do me a favor don't screw it up this time I went out of my way to set this one up for you

100
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,511
You know she's the daughter of a state legislator

101
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,911
She is beautiful and intelligent all in one package in other words Perfection well we'll

102
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:17,055
Say about that but you know what all kidding aside you're right it is time for me to find someone

103
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:23,455
Of course I'm right the thing is that someone in your position without a wife just seems like

104
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,271
Hey

105
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
I'm sure you've seen those before the kind that have a little Nutcracker figuring pop

106
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
But every hour

107
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,983
Excuse me about the clock in the window hey what's going on you're already late for your date what

108
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
Doing

109
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
People start over all the time

110
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
It's never too

111
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
I believe

112
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Officer

113
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Excuse me

114
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
Officer are you out there

115
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Hello

116
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,199
I'm ready to confess but I prefer if Dr tenmo were present

117
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Where you could have gone

118
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
Hey officer I wanted to

119
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,823
Listen I know it's late but can I go see one of my patients

120
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
Yes but of course Dr Tem

121
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
What is it you have there

122
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,455
I found something special

123
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,727
Hey what's the matter are you all right

124
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,527

Mr young girls

126
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
It's the same as last time

127
00:11:53,983 --> 00:12:00,127
McKenzie my patience disappearing just like 9 years ago

128
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
Mr y

129
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Mr Yonkers

130
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
It's me

131
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
Dr Tem

132
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Stay away doctor

133
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
Let's go back to the hospital Mister Yonkers

134
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
Everything will be all right

135
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
Don't come any closer

136
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,495
I'm begging you please don't look at him

137
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
At who

138
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
He's the one who killed my friends and I'll kill you too

139
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:18,463
Who are you oh God just run run away

140
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
It's been a long time

141
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:28,959
It's me 9 years ago you

142
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:35,359
9 years ago

143
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,759
You forgotten already doctor about the twins

144
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
That's right

145
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
That twin

146
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
You remember

147
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,103
Ron don't look at his face he'll kill you

148
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,711
What do you think you're doing here Mr Jones is my patience let him go

149
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
What am I doing

150
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
And execution

151
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:37,567
We were hired by him he call us each time will be wired to our accounts after each job

152
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:43,967
That way it seems like we had taken the money and split it he had it all figured out

153
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
The murder of those four middle-aged couples was ordered by it was you

154
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
The police started suspecting me and following me so he wanted to get rid of us listen to me the other

155
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,447
Fred said to me just before he died that we had

156
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,799
Oh my God that we have been hired by a monster

157
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,919
He doesn't even blink at killing someone that means nothing to him

158
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,015
Run Doctor he'll kill you where you stand just blood

159
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
You talk too much Younkers

160
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Johan

161
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
Don't do this

162
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,719
Mr guncas doesn't know your identity but I do

163
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
How was your attending physician

164
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,423
You are so hungry but the Elder of fraternal twins

165
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,031
If you were the son of Michael Liebert former advisor of Commerce

166
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,591
Who fled East Germany in 1986

167
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
Has a political Refugee to the West

168
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
If we know this much about you

169
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
You can't possibly Escape

170
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
Don't add your crimes Johan

171
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
Johan huh

172
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,183
Yes there was a time when I went by that name

173
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:05,119
But you know something doctor Johan isn't my real name what are you talking about

174
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,519
You must never know about my past not about those four couples

175
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,151
But you're different doctor

176
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
You cared for me and you restored me to life so I feel as though you're like a father to

177
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
Like a father

178
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:32,767
The truth is if it weren't for you I wouldn't be standing here right now

179
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,567
A human life is precious don't you see that rescuing you open my eyes I was able to go back

180
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,967
Saving your life made me realize that the weight of each life is equal no one's better

181
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
What are you laughing at

182
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:20,383
I heard you were promoted to chief of surgery soon after that incident

183
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
I'm really happy doctor

184
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
That you were promoted to that position

185
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,063
What are you trying to tell me

186
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,439
You are where you are today because the director and the others died right

187
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
I'm so glad I was able to help

188
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:42,655
That was a good thing

189
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:49,055
My God isn't that what you wanted Doctor that's what you said

190
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,455
Right after I regained Consciousness that's what you told me

191
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
That you hated them so much you wish they were dead I am not wrong

192
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:08,255
Bastard bastard

193
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
All that I did was grant you your wish

194
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
I was supposed to die that night

195
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
You're the one who resurrected me doctor

196
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,023
What a miserable downpour

197
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
I just spies the wet weather

198
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,935
All it does is wash away the crime scene evidence when you need it the most

199
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,983
Well wouldn't you agree

200
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
Dr Tim

201
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
All

202
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,735
To summarize what you told me so far

203
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
Just to make sure that we piece it all together

204
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,135
Back in 1986

205
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,999
Liebert a high government official escape from East Germany with his wife and two children

206
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:22,399
Right after they arrive the Liebert family was attacked the couple was killed in the twin brothers suffered a critical gun

207
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
Got wound to the Head

208
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:29,055
You were the surgeon in charge of his operation and subsequently save the boys life

209
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
But to everyone surprises fate would have it the boy kills the director the chief of surgery and

210
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,831
Head of neurosurgery with poison candy and then disappears

211
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:47,231
And last night after 9 long years out of the clear blue the Libra boy reappears and kills a

212
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:53,631
Police officer with poison candy yet again and right in front of your eyes he shoots Adolf euchre's

213
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Patient

214
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:01,055
He is none other than the very man that hired you and curse and two others to murder the four middle-aged couples across

215
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
Germany

216
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,359
And his name is

217
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
Johan

218
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
Liebert

219
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,759
I believe that's the entire story isn't it

220
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes sir I think we're finished with the doctor he can go

221
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:31,520
I don't think that someone with Dr tennis credentials or in his position could be responsible for such a crime

222
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,592
He has an alibi for the time the policeman was killed

223
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,176
And we didn't find any gunpowder residue on his hands

224
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
So much for key

225
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,576
There go all of our leads to solving those murders of the four middle-aged coup

226
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:50,208
Inspector Lungi should we get started on this Johan Liebert for the time being
