1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,912
We've just confirmed at least five are dead and 34 injured due to a fire that broke out here

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
At the University of Munich's Friedrich Emanuel Campus Library

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,176
Earlier we had a chance to talk to some of the survivors let's take a look

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
Suddenly found myself surrounded by fire everywhere the smoke was so thick in the air I can hard

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,392
I thought I would die

6
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:32,000
Then somebody rushed in and saved us yeah he was this young Asian man

7
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,280
Is it all right

8
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,352
I saw him shoot the hinges off the door to get it open but

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
After that

10
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,424
If it went for him

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,472
So many of us would have died

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:50,944
The police have confirmed that the fire was started with a mixed kerosene gasoline accelerant

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,064
The police have also promised to bring the arsonist to justice as swiftly as possible

14
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
It's completely destroyed

15
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,744
So much for this so-called Legacy of human wisdom ashes to ashes I guess

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,144
Were there any fingerprints on the sniper rifle we found I don't think we're going to be able to pull any reasonable

17
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
Prince on the other hand the weapon is a Mauser sr-93 just like the one purchased by that Japanese

18
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
Man who we believe to be Dr tema

19
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
I'm telling you it's going to be difficult to find any trace of the perpetrator a fire this hot really cleans the crime scene there's no

20
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
No such thing as a clean crime scene here's a cufflink

21
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
Send it to the lab someone was here and nobody can do anything without

22
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
Some sort of trace of themselves if there were such a person he could hardly be

23
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Considered human but let's suppose someone was here and that we still couldn't find any trace of them who does that

24
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
That only a demon however since no such thing exist

25
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
Exist there must be someone real to arrest

26
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
Engine meeting with shoe volt for me but he still held up in the Intensive Care Unit admittedly his Burns aren't really

27
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
Really that severe but because of his Advanced stage the doctors are refusing to allow him any visitors let's go

28
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
You're being unreasonable sir he's not ready for visitors yet he's conscious isn't he

29
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,784
I only need a few minutes of his time he needs

30
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
Absolute quiet

31
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
Who's the young man

32
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,184
Oh him that's Mr Shoe Volt's son

33
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,791
I'm sorry such a terrible thing happened to your father

34
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,119
My name is Lungi I'm with a bka

35
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,031
I know I've already talked to the police about this but there's someone I really need to find

36
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,039
Wait who is he the person in that photograph is the man who tried to assassinate your father

37
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,415
Are you sure you don't recognize him I've never seen him before

38
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
But maybe Johan would have

39
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
Johan that's what I've been trying to tell everybody his name is Johan Liebert and I need you to find him

40
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,447
Johan Libra today

41
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,311
The last time I saw Johan he was going to attend the ceremony at the library with my father

42
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
But I've searched everywhere and I can't find him

43
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Yes I understand

44
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
I'll call for a search immediately

45
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,999
This is the room Johan Liebert was renting

46
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,911
Like I said before he moved out of here two weeks ago

47
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
We checked at the

48
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791
High school at Friedrich Emanuel but his name didn't show up at the registrar is he really wasn't a student didn't you say his parents live

49
00:05:54,047 --> 00:06:00,191
Lifting off in Bach what about them yeah that parent-angle turned out to be another dead end it seems they never really

50
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
They talk to any of their neighbors I guess there's nothing left to do except dust for Prince huh we're probably not

51
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
Going to find anything I have no data to in

52
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
Never before I've never

53
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
Never seen a room so devoid of any human presence yeah I am

54
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:32,191
I am Johann Liebert who am I

55
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
I was here but I don't exist

56
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
Am I a demon

57
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,095
I'm just glad your injuries weren't that bad Nina

58
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
I'm sorry to make you worry loud

59
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
Thank you

60
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
Well of course I was going to worry about you

61
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,847
I mean they kept pulling survivors out of the library and you were still nowhere to be found

62
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
I didn't know what had happened to you

63
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,783
Still it's a miracle you made it out of the library all on your own with those injuries

64
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Even the firefighters were shocked

65
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
That's because someone saved me

66
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
Somebody saved you

67
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,303
Nina you were the last person that made it out of the building

68
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
A Japanese man

69
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Huh

70
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,495
Do you know if there was a Japanese doctor among any of the survivors

71
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
There were some Japanese people

72
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
But all of them were just businessmen

73
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
That is impossible

74
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,063
Inside the Library I was trapped under a curtain when he found me

75
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047
Nina

76
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
Nina Nina

77
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
I'm sure that he was real

78
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
I know he was

79
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
According to Witnesses

80
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
Just before the fire started

81
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,319
You told everyone attending the ceremony to evacuate

82
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,671
What would cause you to do something like that

83
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
You knew something was about to happen

84
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
Was that it

85
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Mr schewald

86
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:40,447
Why don't we call it a day do you know the man in this photograph

87
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,055
Can you see the man in the photograph clearly sir

88
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,407
This is the man who we believe tried to assassinate you

89
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,735
We have witnesses placing him at the library

90
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,551
But here's what doesn't make sense to me

91
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,415
All of our Witnesses claim to have seen this man rescuing people from the fire

92
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
Look that's enough

93
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
Please just let him rest

94
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,399
Don't forget to contact me if you should remember anything else

95
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Just one more thing

96
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,175
Do you know where your secretary Johan Liebert has disappeared to

97
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
Please

98
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Just leave already

99
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Looks like he's gone completely senile well I guess it can't be helped I mean

100
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
When you see something that terrifying at his age you know so ends the reign of the vampire of Bavaria

101
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
Once great emperor of the business world no he understood every word I

102
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
Oh let's question the other Witnesses shall we do you have the list of victims

103
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
Oh yeah but what's this all about we have testimon

104
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
People from the fire maybe it's just like that multiple

105
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
Personality theory

106
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
Nina Fortner

107
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
What about Nina Fortner

108
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,679
If you're looking for Nina Fortner she checked out of the hospital this morning

109
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:53,567
And unfortunately the address we have for in the police register is fictitious how about the hospitals

110
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Yes sir

111
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
I'll look it up right now

112
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Nina Fortner

113
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,527
There was a Nina Fortner whose parents were killed in Heidelberg

114
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,087
Her current whereabouts are unknown

115
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,463
Thank you for sharing such a painful story with me

116
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
You know Nina

117
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:17,375
It matches up perfectly with another story from 10 years ago told to me by Dr Tenma

118
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Yes

119
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,263
And that story started him down to path that led him here

120
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
And from here he set off on his journey

121
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
To kill Johan

122
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Nina

123
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
That day

124
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:37,855
I went to the library because I thought the timer was going to carry out his assassination attempt

125
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
But then with that fire

126
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,487
I don't even know for sure if Timo was there

127
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
Let alone Johan

128
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Please Nina

129
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,703
Let go of any thoughts of chasing down Johann

130
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,263
He's not someone you can handle yourself

131
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,335
Look I know the police don't seem very helpful

132
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:04,991
But we have to try and lay low and take our time to fight this I promise the truth will be revealed in time

133
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
It's okay

134
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
We're all here for you

135
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
You must be tired

136
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,695
Please feel free to stay here as long as you like

137
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
He was there

138
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
I mean

139
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
I saw him that day

140
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
Tema was there in the library

141
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,599
You've got to eat something

142
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
I know dear

143
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:49,023
Thank you it's called a kaiser roll

144
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,351
It has roasted ham and gouda cheese on it

145
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
10 more really likes them

146
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,055
That's very kind of you

147
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
Really nothing picks me up like something delicious

148
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
10 more always used to say that too

149
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
I want to see him

150
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
I want to see Tema again yeah

151
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
The weather is finally starting to look nice again

152
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,455
Father when you're feeling better why don't we take a vacation together

153
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,759
Maybe the two of us could tour Asia

154
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
I think A Change of Atmosphere would be nice

155
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,183
Why don't you just rest a bit longer

156
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,767
I know you've been through more than enough recently

157
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
Bridge

158
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
There

159
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
Father what is it

160
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
Are you trying to tell me something

161
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
The three frogs

162
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
Three frogs

163
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
In his eyes

164
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
I saw hell

165
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Right there in his eyes

166
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
Hell

167
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,767
In the eyes of a living human being

168
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Yes

169
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,495
I need you to deliver a message to a certain man I yes

170
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
There's a man

171
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
A man waiting interesting

172
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:44,991
Interesting what do you want me to say when I find him I want you to tell him that I

173
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Yes

174
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:52,159
And the man in Dresden he'll know what you're talking about right so should I leave

175
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
Leave now father

176
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
I understand

177
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
I'll leave immediately

178
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
I know

179
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,311
I know that your mother hated me in the ad

180
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,407
You're wrong I promise she never hated you

181
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
When you return from Dres

182
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:25,951
Can you promise that you will come back and stay with me

183
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
Yes

184
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
I'm afraid

185
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
I see

186
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Afraid of what

187
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
I don't know

188
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
But I'm afraid try and stay calm

189
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
We need you to remember

190
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Just go slow

191
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
Like a town from a fairy tale

192
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
A fairy tale Village

193
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Where was it

194
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,623
The feelings that you had when you were looking at this picture book

195
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Just

196
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
Tell me whatever pops into your head

197
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,823
Dr Gillen careful just a little bit more

198
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
There were three

199
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,247
Two or three frogs

200
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,319
There were three frogs three frogs

201
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
What are you talking about

202
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,951
What

203
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
Is there a picture of three frogs in the children's book that made Johann faint

204
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,935
I've never seen a single frog anywhere then where did you see them

205
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
It's all right

206
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Why don't we stop here for now

207
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Okay

208
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:11,167
I'm going on record saying it was a mistake to trust that inspect

209
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
Longe from the bka

210
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,311
Yes I think it's time for us to rethink our strategies

211
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,919
The next time we take anything to the authorities will talk to his superiors

212
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:28,063
And that's only after we've taken our time together irrefutable evidence to support our claim agreed

213
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
You think we should take our time

214
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:36,767
How much time as of now the profile we built for Johan is vague and unimpressive at best

215
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
Johan with you about secretary

216
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,399
It's reasonable to think she was might have some information

217
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,471
But he's not taking visitors at the moment

218
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:52,127
How about his son Carl he's been gone for the past couple of days now and I can't get a hold of him

219
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
It's nothing concrete

220
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
But I've heard some of the witnesses say

221
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,087
That an anonymous Asian man was seen rescuing people from the library fire

222
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,743
But if they find him his fingerprints on the sniper rifle then all those witness reports won't mean anything they'll just assume

223
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:13,119
He's guilty why wouldn't they it all will have been for not how long do we have to wait

224
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:19,519
We don't have any time by the time the truth is revealed in the police finally make a move by that time

225
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Nina

226
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
I'm so sorry

227
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,415
Nina I understand how you feel about this I told you before I lost one of my closest and Dearest

228
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
It's Richard to this case

229
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
He had such a bright future ahead of him

230
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
But Johan got his future short

231
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,447
I am not giving up on this I never will

232
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:56,895
No let's eat

233
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
Three frogs

234
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
Like a town from a fairy tale

235
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
With

236
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:25,055
I remember

237
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
Cheater I

238
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
I'm going to

239
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,263
What are you saying dear you can't come with me

240
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,663
You need to stay right here all right and please tell doctor right fine that I said thank you for everything he's done for me

241
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
Take care

242
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
I want

243
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
I want to see Tim

244
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
The third day was a bus too waiting the Town Square he says he's got to be kidding this

245
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
Place is just too big

246
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
Sorry Father it doesn't seem like I'll be meeting up with the

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,976
The man who was attempting to assassinate your father

250
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,400
Is that what the police told you yeah well at least it doesn't look like they have anybody

251
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Telling you

252
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,984
For 3 days I've been watching you from that building

253
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,568
All right you can give me the message now

254

Should talk bridge and the three frogs my father said something else also

260
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
If the monster that you're chasing

261
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
Happens to have a twin

262
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,344
The mother of those same twins

263
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:24,000
Is still alive and Brock
