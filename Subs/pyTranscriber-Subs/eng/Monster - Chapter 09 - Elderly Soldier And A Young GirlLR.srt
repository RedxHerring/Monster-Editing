1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,824
It looks like another scorcher today hey

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,224
Why are you all bundled up on a hot summer day like this aren't you broiling huh you're reading an old paper

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,624
That one's at least 3 days old yeah a couple inverted got themselves murdered they say

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,024
Doctor did it if you can believe that hey buddy you said you were headed for burden wasn't that right

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,424
What you know somebody over there yeah I do I'm not even sure if he'll still be there now

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,824
I have to try and find them

7
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,640
Formerly served in the French Foreign Legion

8
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,760
Then when freelance and fought in Nicaragua in 1979

9
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,160
From 1981 to 1984 assisted the Guerrilla rebels in Afghanistan

10
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
Then in 1987 you played a key role in the assassination of radical Islamic leaders in

11
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,864
Top secret moussard operation

12
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
It's quite an impressive resume I must admit

13
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
Isn't it Mr Hugo Bernhardt

14
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:32,480
I have no doubt that a mercenary of your caliber must be quite a teacher and I'm sure a number of distinguished

15
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
Men must have been under your instruction

16
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
It might be a good idea to send some of our own officers to attend your seminar and have you with them into shape

17
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
That'd be great

18
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Incidentally

19
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
Was this man here a good student by any chance I believe he showed up at your training grounds about 5 months

20
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Months ago

21
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,664
We know that he is a genius with a scalpel

22
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,504
What I'm wondering about is whether he has any Talent with a gun

23
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,392
I don't divulge information about my pupils to anyone period

24
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
Of course you don't

25
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,167
So have you ever trained with a gun before no I guess that means that yourself taught then

26
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
Actually

27
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,751
I've never shot a gun before

28
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
What you mean not even once right

29
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
I know I'm asking for the impossible

30
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,223
Matt said you're my only hope right now

31
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
It makes no difference

32
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,879
I make all my students forget everything they learned before they got here

33
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
But this

34
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,047
This is the first time I'll be teaching someone who's never shot a gun before

35
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
Jump rope

36
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,239
Regardless of your experience or lack of this is where everyone starts now jump like that child over there

37
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Don't just stand there

38
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
Well get started

39
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Yes sir

40
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,215
Faster now hurry it up

41
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,775
I said faster

42
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
Balance it's all about balance

43
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
Come on faster

44
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
I said faster

45
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,535
Well obviously I can't jump rope nearly as well as you do

46
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,471
Tell me something is this what you do you know always supervising

47
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
Student training like this all right I understand you don't have to

48
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
To keep on staring at me like that

49
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
I'll do it

50
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:54,111
I know what I have to do

51
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:06,911
Hey it's a brandling I wonder

52
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:13,311
Wonder if it's looking for food for its chicks

53
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
What's wrong are you too tired to eat

54
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Yes

55
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
You can't train if you pass out

56
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Yes sir

57
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
She your daughter

58
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
Or your granddaughter Maybe

59
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Neither

60
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
That little girl is the daughter of a woman I killed

61
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
Shut it down right before very eyes

62
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
Backing me on my

63
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,175
On Mission in the jungle I ran into a hut for shelter

64
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,735
And there she was with her mother

65
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
Her mother was holding a gun if I'd have been a fraction of a second slower it would have been me that

66
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Not that day

67
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
I brought the child back here with me I couldn't just leave her

68
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
From that moment on

69
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
She hasn't smiled once

70
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
That's why

71
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,551
She'll probably hate me for the rest of her life

72
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
That's the sort of thing that happens when you have

73
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
A gun now if you can't handle that then I'd suggest you don't carry one

74
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
What's that what a person sometimes it smells just like Daphne blossom

75
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
Thanks

76
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,919
All right that's enough of that

77
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
So then

78
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
Time for some more running go

79
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Yes sir

80
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
Right away then

81
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,183
When you're done running come to the bottom of the hill in the back

82
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
What's down there the firing range

83
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
The firing range

84
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Remember

85
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
Two shots

86
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
You have to make sure that whenever you fire your gun you always pull the trigger twice if you can do that instinctively it better is your

87
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
Chances of taking out your objective

88
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
If you can't do that

89
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
Then you're as good as Dad it's all over

90
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:14,175
What's this about you're always preparing meals for me so I thought it would cook for you today

91
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
It's a Japanese stew of meat and potatoes it's called nikujaga go on dig in I think you'll both enjoy it

92
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
Those are chopsticks they're carved out of wood I made them I thought it would make

93
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,375
Our dining experience more authentic

94
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:46,175
Wow you're really good at using Chopsticks aren't you

95
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
Again faster

96
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
Do it again

97
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:19,359
What's wrong

98
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
It's a baby brambling I guess it fell out of its nest huh no wait

99
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:38,559
You have to put it back and that chick is going to die it's very difficult to

100
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:44,959
Erase them like that they rarely survive for that long outside of the nest

101
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,359
Let's put it back

102
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:57,759
With its mother okay

103
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,967
3 seconds

104
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
That's all the time you've got

105
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,879
Find your target and pull the trigger cuz one mistake of the slightest bit of hesitation and you're dead

106
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:47,679
Tell me how well did he perform over those 5 months he was there training

107
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
With you

108
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
Technically speaking he was a perfect student

109
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
He built up the necessary stamina

110
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,639
And his concentration while firing was extraordinary

111
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
However

112
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
However

113
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,551
Being able to actually shoot a person is another story

114
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Really

115
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,159
Whether or not he is successful on his first kill

116
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
That's what it all comes down to

117
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,327
Either he's got what it takes or he doesn't yes I see

118
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
I wonder which road this man will choose

119
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
Well it matters not

120
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
Tell me

121
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,567
Do you have any idea where he might have gone

122
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,503
Because if you do know where I would really like for you to tell me

123
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,399
Thanks for all you've done for me over the past 5 months

124
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,959
Here's the remaining tuition I owe

125
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,543
And please help yourself to the necojaga

126
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
Again

127
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
Thank you for everything

128
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
Damn it

129
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
Damn it

130
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
She's laughing

131
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:50,047
So how about it you do know where this man was heading don't you

132
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
That I can't tell you

133
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,895
That's

134
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:11,295
Fine you can go now

135
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,696
This way sir
