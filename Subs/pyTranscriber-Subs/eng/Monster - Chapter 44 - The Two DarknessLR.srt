1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:07,168
From here on we've got to keep a tighter lid on all of this once it's gone things

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,568
Will be as smooth as silk my head I sure could go for a nice drink right about now how about

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,640
About a whiskey Bonbon instead

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
Hey there better than nothing besides these were a gift from a real Beauty

5
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
What's wrong you look depressed

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,328
I feel like I can't believe in anything anymore

7
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,656
I'll help you if you want me to

8
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:45,056
I believed in him I never would have thought that inspector zaiman could do such a thing

9
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:51,456
What happened I believed in hell

10
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
Right now the only person who I really believe in

11
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Is you

12
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,680
A terribly shocking Discovery was made early this morning at the Prague police station

13
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Three men

14
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
Two big questions remain

15
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
There have been rampant rumors of the Prague police force having ties to the former Czechoslovakian secret police but these

16
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
Have never been substantiated

17
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
However

18
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
With the murder of these three prominent detective do you know who the murderer is

19
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
Sir can you confirm that the drug used to commit these murders with a muscle relaxant we've heard rumors that hit cheap Hamrick was somehow

20
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,592
I'll link with the check secret place any truth to that

21
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,760
Well I is there any connection between these murders and last week's killing of inspector zaimon

22
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
Well

23
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
We are an investigating that

24
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:43,232
I mean we're not rolling out that possibility in saying that do you mean the department strongly believes that these two incidents are linked

25
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
No I

26
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
Right now the department is pursuing all possible leads in this investigation sorry but this detectives not assigned to this case and we have no

27
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,264
So you need a button that lip of yours and get out of here

28
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
Yes sir

29
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
So exactly when are you going to make an official statement we will have a news conference when we feel we've gathered enough information

30
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:10,368
Not a moment before drug treatment

31
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Why are you here

32
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,359
Have you come back to interrogate them again I'm very sorry ma'am

33
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,967
Look I've been given orders to investigate this case starting again at Square One

34
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,831
This is my last stop I've already spoken with all the boys who got placed in other orphanages

35
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,671
Think of what bringing this up again does to them

36
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,071
Mr pedrov raised all those boys like they were his own children now they have to live the rest of their lives with the image of

37
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
Raymond is made lying they're dead

38
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,959
Even now some of them still cry themselves to sleep

39
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
I want to help them forget this as soon as possible

40
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
And yes

41
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:10,015
That's not something they can just forget about knowing that someone they truly loved has been taken away

42
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Forever

43
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,927
15 minutes

44
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,023
And don't go asking them questions that are too graphic am I clear

45
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Sure

46
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
It was lots of fun living with Mr Pedro

47
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,983
Yeah he and Mrs Anna were really nice to us all the time

48
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
I see

49
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,847
No I'd like to talk to you about the day you found them if that's okay

50
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
That day you had Mr Grimmer come to visit have you met him before

51
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
No

52
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
Not before then

53
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Do you know why he came to visit

54
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,695
As they talked did Mr Grimmer act friendly towards Mr Patrick

55
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,303
Come to think of it they didn't talk or act like friends but

56
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
But I didn't understand

57
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
They were talking in German

58
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
But you know a few words in German don't you

59
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Whether some words you did know

60
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
He was saying that this

61
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,639
Was unauthorized and

62
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
Police should be

63
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
So Mr Grimmer said that

64
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Yeah

65
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,575
He also said experiment and the word education

66
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
Experiment

67
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
Anything else

68
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
What else

69
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,535
You don't have to tell us if you don't want to hunza

70
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
He said 511 kinderheim

71
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
51

72
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
Tenderheim huh okay

73
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,775
So hunza is that a place that you've heard of

74
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
No never

75
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Do you know it

76
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,127
There's no such place in the Czech Republic

77
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
I see

78
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,319
So tell me about Mr Grimmer

79
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
What kind of person is he

80
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
Oh he's a really nice guy

81
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
So you like him too is he

82
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
People in soccer with us

83
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
It wasn't really any good at it

84
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:05,215
Put Mr Grimmer look like he was having a lot of fun delay he has a soccer ball is just awful

85
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
He went up for one and fell flat on his butt he's probably even worse than hunza really

86
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,735
The other boys told me you were the leader at Mr petrov's orphanage is that right Antonin

87
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,879
I wouldn't say I was really the leader it's just well you see I'm just older than the other

88
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:28,255
Now I'd like to talk to you about that day is it about Mr Grimmer

89
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,607
One of the guys already told me that you were asking honza and Izzy about him

90
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Oh

91
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
I see

92
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
What do you think

93
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
I think he's a nice person

94
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,359
I got a question for you do you think Mr grimmer's a suspect no

95
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,199
But we're still investigating

96
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
Mr pedrov and Mrs Anna had already been murdered by the time we got back home from playing soccer with Mr Grimmer

97
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
I told the police already but I think I saw did it as we got back home I saw this beautiful woman with long

98
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,815
Blonde hair and she was coming out of her house

99
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
Are you trying to catch him catch who Mr Grimmer no but he sure

100
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
There's someone I'd like to have a chat with

101
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,087
I'm actually going to meet him later on

102
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
I promised him and we already set where we're going to meet

103
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:38,143
And would you tell me where that is you're sure that's all right because I might be forced to arrest him

104
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,287
Well you don't have to cuz there's no way he murdered anyone

105
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Hey

106
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Hi

107
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
It's been a little while

108
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
I'm so are you guys all holding up okay

109
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Things are a lot better

110
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
You haven't been crying yourself to sleep right

111
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
Easy with his bed twice

112
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:16,287
Well it was the truth be known I went in my bed until I was a lot older than he is now really

113
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
Hey Anton

114
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
Did you bring that one thing I gave you earlier

115
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Thank you

116
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
I'm glad you held on to it for me

117
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
See this is something very important Mr pedrov left behind

118
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
I'm glad you're all okay

119
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
I wish I had more time to share

120
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
But I've got to go

121
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
Can't you stay and play soccer with us

122
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,591
I'm sorry boys I really should be moving on

123
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,919
But we're ready to play those are a new friend

124
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Yeah

125
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
I can play for a while

126
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
All right

127
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,351
Come on I'm open on the right guys pass it to me

128
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:18,751
Oh I got it Grimmer going in for the steel

129
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:31,551
It's easier said than done

130
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
You're Mr Grimmer aren't you

131
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Did you come to arrest me

132
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,407
Don't start waving your gun around

133
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Come on their kids here

134
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,271
Then I order you to hand over your pistol this instant

135
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
Sorry

136
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
I don't have one to hand over

137
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
So you tossed it

138
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
I never had one in the first place

139
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
Tell me did you kill inspectors Amon

140
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
I don't know

141
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
I can't remember

142
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
I was half dead from being tortured at the time

143
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Your nails done

144
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
I know it wasn't me who fired the gun

145
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,343
But I might be responsible for killing the other two

146
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
I passed out before it

147
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,719
Mr grandma

148
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
What are you up there resting

149
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,631
Your team stop playing a man down cuz you went and took a break

150
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,679
Sorry about that guys

151
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Hey I'm old cut me some slack

152
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
Okay you

153
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,871
Antonin told me that you were planning to meet them to play soccer that's how I found you

154
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
You're a person of interest Mr Grimmer

155
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
So what's the verdict am I the murderer you seek

156
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
I don't know

157
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,927
Over the past few days some of the people I deeply trusted betrayed me

158
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,791
My faith in them was so totally shattered I don't know what to believe in anymore

159
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
The only person you can truly believe in is yourself

160
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:26,495
You can try to trust other folks but sometimes they let you down

161
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,847
So we going to the station

162
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,663
No just promise you won't leave town okay

163
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
So

164
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
Where are you staying for the time being

165
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
At the Pablo hotel room 302

166
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,023
Whenever you decide I am the murderer feel free to come and get me

167
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,423
You be sure to hold on to that key I think it's the

168
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
The real cause of all these murders you're investigating it's to a safety deposit box

169
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
That sign up there

170
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
Well it's actually an old Relic

171
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,719
It's a sign for a pub that was established here 200 years ago

172
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,535
But the three frogs Pub has been closed down for AG

173
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,399
Even though it's old and Faded it's considered a landmark

174
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
And it seem a lot

175
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,775
It's been through World Wars the fall of Communism and disasters too

176
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
It's amazing that whole thing is survived

177
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,151
About a decade ago it even made it through a fire

178
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Really

179
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Yeah

180
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,295
This woman with a young kid lived up there on the second floor right above it

181
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
She sure was a beautiful woman

182
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
What kind of antisocial hardly ever went out

183
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
And for a good reason

184
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
Seems while she was living there

185
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
She was using it alias

186
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,655
One day this big official looking black car came and it took her and the kid away for good

187
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,079
It was a big deal we all heard rumors that the woman was arrested for having participated in anti-government activities

188
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:12,479
That sort of thing happened to all too often in those days we lived in fear because the government terrorized everyone it

189
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879
It was really quite awful during those final years before the fall of Communism people disappeared all the

190
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:25,279
That woman who got taken away did she have one child with her did she have twins no

191
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,679
She only had one child with her what a pretty face that kid had what's that woman's child a boy or a girl

192
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
Let me think for a second now which one was it sometimes it's really

193
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
Hard to tell whether they're a boy or a girl with Children of that little man I can't remember all I can think about is how they

194
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
They took away that poor innocent kid with them when they took the mother away that was a sad thing to see right after they left

195
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,279
Left the fire started I ran up there even though I didn't think anyone was around then I got a huge surprise

196
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Her child was in there

197
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
The child must have been released that's all I can figure but I imagine the fire got started when he got hungry and decided to

198
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,799
Use the stove to try to cook something so where'd he go

199
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,455
I hate to admit it but after that fire happened I don't know where that young kid went I've always wondered what

200
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
That kid

201
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,879
What if that child was one of the ladies twins what if the police took away one child and

202
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
The other one up in that room well if what you just said is right that might make sense

203
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,679
But I don't get why you're so sure about the fact that she had twins

204
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,943
So after questioning the boys I was able to meet with Grimmer and check him out for myself

205
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
I really don't think he's the murder

206
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,391
Well I'm just an amateur at crime solving Maybe I'm Wrong about him Mr

207
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
He's not evil that much I do know

208
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Just from us talking

209
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
He was able to help me figure out what's really going on

210
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607
It first went inspectors Amon was found murdered

211
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
I thought it was my duty to avenge his death at any cost

212
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
But then I open my eyes

213
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
I discovered that inspector zaymond

214
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
A man I looked up to

215
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Was a corrupt cop

216
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
I have been willing to risk everything for him

217
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
That's all changed

218
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
And then after that

219
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,343
The chief and to senior officers I always reported to wound up poison

220
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,671
When I heard that those men might have been corrupt

221
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
As well it shook me to

222
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
I mean it's beyond belief

223
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,095
How far has this terrible Darkness spread in the world

224
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Darkness

225
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,215
Yes the dark Specter of the check secret police hangs over all of this

226
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,591
The check secret police work directly under the former Internal Affairs office

227
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,431
They were a brutal force that served as an essential tool of the Soviet Union

228
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
But when democracy came 10 years ago they were disband

229
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,599
Their leaders were put on trial but some escaped and went underground

230
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,671
Even now they're still planning to regain their former power

231
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
That's as much as I know about

232
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,303
In their quest for power many innocent victims have wound up dead

233
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,119
Are the secret police the only ones Behind These murders

234
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
That's the question I'm faced with

235
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,727
Is there any way we can really know just

236
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
How closely the darkness is encroached upon the world we live in

237
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
I don't think I believe in anyone anymore

238
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Mr Grimmer even worn me

239
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
Only believe in yourself

240
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,039
He said when you trust other people it doesn't always work out

241
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,391
And as he said that he entrusted me with something very important

242
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Sorry

243
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
I can't stop talking about this

244
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,327
It's kind of tough on me not even knowing your name

245
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,703
Hey listen it's all right you don't have to tell me

246
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,847
I always thought when people spend time getting to know one another

247
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Told each other their names

248
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
About their pasts

249
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
Just talking to you makes me happy

250
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,047
Both of my parents are still alive

251
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Their school teachers

252
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,935
But my father used to participate in Democratic activities in the police always watched him

253
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,287
So my mom ended up divorcing him to protect me from any potential trouble

254
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,359
When I finally told my mom I wanted to be a detective

255
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
She got angry and told me not to do it

256
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,295
And why did you want to become a detective I believe my friends at the bar told you the reason why I remember

257
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
Wasn't it because you grew up liking cops on TV

258
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,951
Yeah I like playing cops and robbers ever since I was a kid

259
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
Of course I always got to be the cop

260
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:50,239
You don't have to laugh that much

261
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
What were you interested with

262
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,791
Earlier you were saying the Grimmer and trusted you was something important

263
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
It's a key to a safety deposit box

264
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
The safety deposit box

265
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
Apparently whatever stored in there is super important

266
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:28,127
This old German man named pedrov who was running in legal orphanage was murdered last week and

267
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,687
Well inside that deposit box of pedrobs

268
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
The data from some kind of

269
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,783
Human experiments he supposedly conducted

270
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,391
According to Grimmer the material that's in that box is the real cause of all these murders

271
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
Don't say that again

272
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,279
Don't tell anyone what you just told me not even the police

273
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Nobody

274
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
But

275
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,447
This thing isn't something I can handle all by myself

276
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
She loves you a lot

277
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,055
When you told her you wanted to be a cop you know why she got mad

278
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
It's because she was worried

279
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
Put something awful might happen to you

280
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,503
I got a bad feeling about what you just told me

281
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
The best thing to do is not to tell anyone

282
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
I don't want you to get hurt

283
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
I care about you too

284
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
I'm sorry

285
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,031
My name

286
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
I want you to know my name now Young

287
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
It's Anna

288
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,711
My name is Anna Li

289
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
Anna

290
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,295
What a beautiful name

291
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
So your last name must mean that you're German

292
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
See you later

293
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
Anna

294
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,256
Good evening Mr Toluca

295
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
Oh Anna it's a nice night isn't it

296
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:33,056
Good evening Anna good night Mrs yoga

297
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,304
A safety deposit box key
