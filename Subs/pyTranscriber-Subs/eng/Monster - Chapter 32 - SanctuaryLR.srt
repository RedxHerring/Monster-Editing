1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:11,008
Hey

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,568
Oh hi lot

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,848
Do you have a minute

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,408
Not really I'm running late

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,456
But what's up

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,272
Maybe we could go and have a cup of coffee

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,160
I thought you might want to talk about how things are going with you and your father I mean you were so worried before

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,720
Not now I'm fine everything's good

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
Yeah but I'm off sorry little but I've got to get home my father has a business meeting and I have to take him to

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,520
To it see you later

11
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:49,920
I was thinking maybe we could go

12
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,392
Please finish up the library will be closing shortly

13
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
We're closing now

14
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
She's come back here again

15
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,592
I've been a beautiful girl like that doesn't have to worry about getting someone to take her to a dance

16
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
Man it's so unfair

17
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
What is it about her

18
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
Come on I'm closing up now

19
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
Yes ma'am

20
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:21,216
I've seen her

21
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Can't remember where

22
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
A dance

23
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
Yeah

24
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
I guess that's what it's called

25
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,688
Normally I wouldn't be interested in that type of thing

26
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
But a friend insisted that I buy some tickets

27
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,856
I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to make it sorry

28
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,672
I have to go with my father to an official state banquet

29
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
It's kind of an important political event

30
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,608
I'm sure you won't have a problem finding someone to take it to the dance

31
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
See you later though

32
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,008
No big deal I didn't really want to go anyway

33
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
You seem familiar

34
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Hey wait

35
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,287
It looks like you're doing research on Margo Langer

36
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,639
Okay I'm doing research on her too I mean we could sure notes

37
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
Please don't erase anything

38
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
I'm putting together data for a paper

39
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,575
I'm not too Frank I'm a cultural anthropology major

40
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
And what about you

41
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,255
Well you've collected a mountain of information Nina

42
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
This page is about the accountant murder

43
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:57,215
I also have a newspaper article on the voice of God case

44
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,519
You've done amazing research

45
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,103
I was thinking mine was impressive but you have me beat for sure

46
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:09,503
Well I've been researching all the unsolved murders in Bavaria over the last 4 years but at the moment I need more

47
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
More information on the former prostitute Margo Langer

48
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,415
Do you think you could help fill in the blanks gee I've told you pretty much all I know

49
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,583
The child born to Margo Langer in the very wealthy hanshuval spent years in foster care but was just recently

50
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,911
Recognize by his father and accepted as his rightful heir

51
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:32,031
Maybe he's the one responsible for the awful events surrounding Mr schumalt

52
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
It's not possible

53
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
I'm 100% sure of it

54
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
You really obsessed with this I mean considering that the research is just for a paper that you have to write for

55
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
For your class

56
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:50,207
You really think so this isn't about some paper is it

57
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
To be perfectly honest with you I'm looking for someone

58
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
Hey can I ask you something

59
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,751
In your whole life if you ever had to worry about anything

60
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
I've been wondering

61
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:10,175
Do beautiful girls like you always get everything they want without lifting a finger does it fall in your lap

62
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
What are you trying to imply

63
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,111
You can probably get any guy you want and never have to spend a minute worrying about it

64
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:25,791
It's fine okay I'm sure you don't have worries like me just forget it all right

65
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Oh man

66
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
Life just seems to be so unfair

67
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
Listen

68
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:41,407
Come with me to the dance tonight it'll be a lot of fun

69
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:54,207
Normally I wouldn't come to these type of things you know come on let's give it a chance

70
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
These guys will talk to me as long as they say I'm with you everyone's looking at

71
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
Hey Google

72
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
I'm Constantine the president of the

73
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Supernatural phenomenon Club

God dang it

80
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,879
What kind of depressing I don't think we're fitting in

81
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,439
Really oh yeah really

82
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,535
All those guys were talking to you but one by one you push them away

83
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,399
Come on you're way too picky Nina I wasn't consciously trying to be rude

84
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
I guess it's just that

85
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm out of practice huh these guys all hang out together they used to joking around

86
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
And having fun

87
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
But for me it's been a long time

88
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Nina

89
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
It sounds like

90
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
And you're pretty old fashioned despite the way you look

91
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,863
Despite the way I look and what exactly is that supposed to mean lota

92
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,287
Hey guess who's back

93
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079

Hey you

97
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,095
No it's not like I'm asking because I dig you or anything

98
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
You're a fine one to talk buddy you're just playing rude come on one stupid little dance let's get it over

99
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:19,103
If you don't dance with me then I won't get paid

100
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,967
Paid to dance with me yeah but I'm not supposed to say anything

101
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:30,367
It's just between calling me he must have thought you wouldn't be able to find anyone who would want to dance with you

102
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
Carl did this

103
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,303
But whatever I'll dance with you so what do you say let's hit the dance floor it Brown is not to step on your toes

104
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,703

105
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:58,015
I'm really sorry I won't ask anymore I promise

106
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,135
Let me go come on please

107
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
We're done

108
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
I must be crazy

109
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
I really liked Carl

110
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
I even helped him get reunited with his father

111
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
I liked him so much

112
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
Thought he liked me

113
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,255
Whatever since Mr shuvald acknowledged him as his true son

114
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,887
He has no time for me he's busy with his father

115
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,663
I feel a lot that it hurts so much

116
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
I never thought that getting rejected whatever feel like this

117
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:10,463
Right now the world is full of pain

118
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
But everything will be all right

119
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
I know it

120
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,287
A bad things can't keep happening forever

121
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
We have to do our part to stop them

122
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
I have to be on

123
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
On my way now so wait tell me where I can reach you Nina

124
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,583
Oh sorry Lota but I'm still trying to get my living arrangements figured out

125
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655
Promise me you'll give me a call you know when you get settled in

126
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
Sure

127
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,287
I enjoyed spending the day with you I really hope you find the person you've been looking for

128
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
I know what it is

129
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
About Nina

130
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,143
Why I thought I'd seen her somewhere before she looks just like Johan

131
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,095
If This Were a regular gun you get high marks for skill

132
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,959
But in this case it's the Precision of the rifle rather than your ability doctor

133
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,871
This weapon might not have tested well enough to be designated the official sniper rifle of the German Army but it

134
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,711
And hit the center of a 5 cm Target from 300 M away

135
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
Even if you're an amateur

136
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,391
I don't know what you're planning to shoot but I'm going to give you a couple of pointers

137
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,999
First the closer you get to your target obviously the better accuracy you'll have

138
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,839
And of course you'll need to find a place where you can get off a clear shot

139
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,935
It comes with 4.338 Lotto magnum bullets

140
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,031
But you won't have time to re-aim and fire off all four of

141
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,615
Really one shots the most you're going to get

142
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
You come here every week

143
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
Are you an avid bird watcher

144
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
Oh yeah

145
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:49,087
I don't know why but Thursday seems to be the most popular day of the week for visitors like that

146
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
Man with his two young companions over there

147
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
And

148
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,535
I suspect you like the Solitude of this Forest

149
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
I'm enjoying it

150
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,423
And yourself it's complicated

151
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
Well actually

152
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
I'm making amends with this place

153
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,991
And I've been doing so for over 60 years

154
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
I haven't seen him before

155
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
From the looks of it

156
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,575
He didn't even take one bite of my special dish that is such a shame

157
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:25,599
Are you ready for a fabulous fries it's

158
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
We've been dreaming about going camping and look for years

159
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,311
You'll be able to take them camping every weekend and stop

160
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,991
Now get ready for your first question

161
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,887
Are you planning to sit here and stare at your food again you came in and did that about a week ago

162
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,959
I make it my business to remember my customers

163
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,799
If you don't have any appetite at least try some soup before you leave

164
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
It's on the house

165
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,943
Come on you better eat thank you for your concern

166
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
I'll

167
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,063
Clear shot here I've got to take him out in this Forest

168
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
Thank goodness

169
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,111
I never thought I'd dripping full I know every inch of this Forest I've walked here for so many years

170
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
Well I must be getting old

171
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,463
You may not have an actual fracture

172
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
I've wrapped it up as a precaution

173
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
But you should get an x-ray at the hospital too

174
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
I didn't Peg you as a doctor

175
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,591
When I first saw you I thought you were a bird watcher or maybe a hunter but that doesn't seem to be the case

176
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
That's really amazing

177
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
What are you talking about

178
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
All the birds huh

179
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,695
They're Gathering Together overhead

180
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
A long time ago

181
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,863
Oh the wild birds would flock together when a young boy appeared

182
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
He would extend his arm like this

183
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,983
And the birds would come to him

184
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,615
As a young boy growing up he'd spend his free time in the forest with the

185
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,503
But then things changed and Hitler's era came along

186
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,831
The boy was now a young man enjoying the police force

187
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
He was convinced at the National Socialist German Workers Party would turn his bankrupt country into

188
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
Ideal place

189
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,607
Then out of the blue this young man was given an order

190
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,447
A vicious criminal had escaped into this very same Forest

191
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:29,567
And because he knew these words so well he was commanded to go out and find him

192
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
Shoot the violent Criminal on site they told him the Young

193
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:43,391
Face the criminal through the forest that he knew like the back of his hand he kept on and on until finally

194
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:49,791
He was he had him cornered with his hands up then he realized that the vicious criminal was actually

195
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:56,191
Just an ordinary man a foreigner it didn't matter the young man felt he

196
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:02,591
Had no choice but to obey without question so he carried out his order

197
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:23,840
Since that day the birds never came to rest on his arm again

198
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:28,960
For 60 long years now with this man of the forest has been trying to make amend

199
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm sorry I'm so sorry

200
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:40,224
Apologize though he may the birds refuse to ever come near him

201
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,424
That's amazing

202
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
It'll be okay now little bird it's your home we respect it

203
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,224
Never again will blood be shed in this Forest is

204
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
Right
