1
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,096
After 10 mom

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:08,704
I don't blame you for saving my brother's life anymore

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,824
You did what you had to do as a doctor it wasn't your fault

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,128
Please eat the sandwiches

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,944
And get some rest too

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,528
Please live on

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,368
And continue to save as many people as you are able to

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,440
Nina Fortner

9
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
Nina are you planning to do are you going to kill

10
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,648
Brother second time I did it I brought him back to

11
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
Life that monster it was me

12
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,120
I brought him back to life

13
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,936
There are a lot of blood vessels in this arterial venous malformation

14
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,240
Cutting all arteries

15
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
And now the veins

16
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,408
Extraction of the night is complete

17
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,744
That went very well yes as usual

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
He's remarkably quick with the clipping

19
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
An amazing operation

20
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:21,984
How is it possible that even after a long break the work of a genius like you only gets better and better

21
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
It's over

22
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
Never mind it is an important

23
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
Isn't that wonderful Kenzo

24
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
Wasn't even about me it was all about your father

25
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
You did such a wonderful job last night working as part of Father's team I'm sure he appreciates all your hard work

26
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
The hospital's reputation no I'm the one who should be grateful

27
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,063
I mean after all it is thanks to your father that I'm actually able to work here in Germany

28
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,927
Hang in there Kenzo if you stick with Father your futures guaranteed

29
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:51,327
It won't be long before father becomes chairman of the board soon after that you'll become chief of surgery

30
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,727
And then Chief director which means I'll be the director's wife

31
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,127
You better make me happy Kenzo cuz hardship doesn't suit me still want to go out on that date

32
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,735
I said we just

33
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,807
Please sir Madam is resting at the moment

34
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
I won't need much of her

35
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
This shouldn't take long

36
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
You really need to make an appointment with Madam

37
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
What's all the racket

38
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,167
I'm terribly sorry to bother you madam but there's a police officer here

39
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
The police

40
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
Miss Ava Heineman

41
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
It's been a while hasn't it

42
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
And how are you supposed to be

43
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,223
I worked on your father's case exactly 9 years ago

44
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
I'm inspector lung

45
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
Of the bka

46
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
Loon gay

47
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Oh I see

48
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
You may leave us holes

49
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Yes madam

50
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
I do remember you

51
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
All too well

52
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
You were that good for nothing detective you couldn't even close my father's case so tell me what on Earth do you want from me now

53
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
I'm quite impressed

54
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,759
You've been able to maintain this residence exactly the same even after your father's death

55
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,879
Actually it appears that the decor might have gotten even more extravagant than before

56
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:57,791
So then if you come to see how much money I've made from The Inheritance my father left me and all my divorce settlements

57
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,703
As you can see detective I live in Absolute Comfort if you see anything you like

58
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,287
Please feel free to take it with you

59
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,919
As long as I have my liquor by my side I'm fine

60
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,015
I've come today because there is something I'd like to show you

61
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
Here take a look at this necktie

62
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,415
A necktie does it look familiar

63
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
Perhaps you don't remember

64
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
It's a design from 9 years ago

65
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
It has a very simple print

66
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
But if you look at it carefully

67
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
It's a Wonderful piece

68
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
With an extremely elaborate weave

69
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
So what what about it

70
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:46,175
Tracing it back was quite a task after all it was purchased 9 years ago

71
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
But luckily this was a limited edition offering especially made for a particular stores higher-end

72
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Clients

73
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,927
And your name was on that list Miss Ava Heineman

74
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,047
So what exactly is your point you see

75
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,143
I was wondering if you might have purchased this and given it to someone as a gift

76
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,495
This necktie is a key piece of evidence and another murder case

77
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
A murder

78
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
Who knows

79
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,319
I've given gifts to so many men I couldn't possibly keep track of them all now could I

80
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,439
They're not interested in me anyway the only thing thereafter is my money

81
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
Please try to remember

82
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:39,679
I told you I don't remember these men are all after my money there isn't a single person

83
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
Truly loves me for who I am

84
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:48,127
That's why I always stick it to them when it's time for the divorce settlement I did not tell all three of them

85
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
Damn bastards

86
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,015
Do you want something too you want something just tell me

87
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
Michelle pay a high price for it

88
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
I'll be back ma'am

89
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,743
If you remember anything please give me a call

90
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,839
Next time you stop by detective be sure to bring me something to drink

91
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
Excuse me

92
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
Ava please you have to

93
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,351
Talk to your father for me make him see I haven't done anything wrong all I did was operate on an emergency patient who

94
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
I was brought in first nothing else

95
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
Why is that the ring that I

96
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:34,367
Spare me Kenzo you're such a fool

97
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167

Well Mr Hess you're certainly looking better today

100
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,655
At this rate I'm guessing you should be able to go home sometime later this week all right

101
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,983
Thank you very much Dr Timmy you did a great job

102
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
By the way my daughter is getting married next month do you think I'll be able to attend her wedding yes that should be fine

103
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,223
You just have to promise me that you won't get too wild at the reception

104
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Thanks doctor

105
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,623
I had resigned myself to not going but thanks to you

106
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
Hey come on it's because you toughed it out

107
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:47,327
With you looking after me I feel as though I'll even live to see my grandchildren get married

108
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,911
You truly are a wonderful doctor

109
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,239
I really hope they keep you with this Hospital forever

110
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
Excuse me Dr tema

111
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615

It's been a while hasn't it Kenzo

115
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
That ass

116
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
Both of us

117
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
Have gone through so much

118
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,903
Hello father are you sleeping already

119
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,559
I'm coming in

120
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:09,759
Ava I know it's difficult but please

00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,159

124
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
You look worn out you're much thinner

125
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
I guess

126
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
I hear that you took some vacation time

127
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:51,999
Well I think that's great you should take a break every once in awhile you always were such a workaholic

128
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,095
Seems like you've lost a little waitress

129
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
I've had a rough couple of years

130
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
I'm sure you've heard all the rumors

131
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
I've heard a few

132
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:14,271
Spring

133
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
You remember

134
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,671
Almost 10 years ago how the two of us would often go out for a drive

135
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
We were so young

136
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,815
It was this time of the year when you tried to swim in that River

137
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,375
I panicked and tried to stop you

138
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,471
But you insisted and you just

139
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
Luck Eva I can't deal with this now

140
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Cancel I

141
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
I want to start over

142
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,671
After three failed marriages I finally realized

143
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,743
That the only one who ever truly loved me

144
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
Was you

145
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
It was you Kenzo

146
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
That was a long time ago

147
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,919
Please cancel

148
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,015
I want you to know that I'm very flattered Ava but there's no going back

149
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
Goodbye

150
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
Hi it seems to me that next time of yours has gotten you in some kind of

151
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
I'm absolutely positive that's the one I gave you as a gift when we were together if you do as I say I'll

152
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
Keep quiet about it I promise you there's something very important that only

153
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:50,271
I can accomplish

154
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
I'll tell the police about your time I'll

155
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,671
Oh I see let's bring Dr

156
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
My infern interrogation right away

157
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
Now we're in the forteners that's not what I'm referring to I'm talking about the killing at Heidelberg Castle

158
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,871
Thank you very much for your cooperation this could prove to

159
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:54,015
A very helpful in solving several of our open cases

160
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
Resignation

161
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,903
But what is the meaning of this doctor ten

162
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,999
I'm very sorry director but I've already made up my mind about this

163
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,655
There have been various odd rumors going around about you recently but I want to be clear I don't believe

164
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Leave any of

165
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
Please think this over you

166

What is it

173
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
Get out of the way you people are interfering with the police like hell doctor would never be capable of killing anyone

174
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:44,607
Anything wrong you're the one though put in jail he would never do anything like that

175
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:51,007
Who is this

176
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
