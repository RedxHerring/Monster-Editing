1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:07,168
My Consciousness awoke inside a coin Locker

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472
In complete darkness

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,824
Blue

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:20,480
The blue skies the blue sea

5
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
And the blue window frame

6
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
I want to go to Tunisia

7
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Gunter Mills arrested in 1988

8
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:46,848
For attacking a bearish on this Bank cash transport vehicle placed in buddenberg prison to serve time

9
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
I'm in 1991 devised a means of Escape it's been 6 months filing through the iron bars of a cell with a large

10
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,648
Nail sharpen into a file he was caught three days later and sent a Criner prison in 19

11
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
93 Escape through a drainage pipe prison issued garments soaked in sewage were found on a nearby River

12
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
Soon arrested again for the attempted robbery of a Maximilian and company payroll delivery truck

13
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
In 97 broke out of ingeborg prison through a hole in a shower stall spent a year digging and Escape Route with a

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,456
The toilets in this place stink pretty bad

15
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,576
Escape through a sewer once so you better believe I know what I'm talking about

16
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,144
Talk about looking down and out eyes forward

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,008
Yeah if I'm not mistaken that's Dr 10 keep walking pal

18
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,152
I never imagined that fella would be looking so hopeless and pathetic

19
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
I'll ask you one more time

20
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,664
The poisoning of Dr Heineman director of Isler Memorial Hospital Dr oppenheim chief of

21
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
And Dr Boyer in 1986

22
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
Confirm or deny it which is it going to be

23
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,488
From the beginning of this interrogation you haven't uttered a single word

24
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,304
Cut the crap 10 Ma

25
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
What is this going to accomplish

26
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,728
The prosecution will go forward whether you keep silent or not

27
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
And you don't stand a chance in court

28
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,336
Why not talk to us

29
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
Come on why don't you make things easier for yourself

30
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
What's going on what's Happening down there looks

31
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
Pretty bad no she's got severe stomach pains hey

32
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Dr Dueler

33
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,631
Has anybody seen Dr Dueler he's in the examination room

34
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,471
Apparently Peter drank some kind of cleaning fluid I'm heading over there now

35
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,127
This is bad it sounds to me like you might be choking on something what

36
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
I can't bre

37
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
Oh man

38
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,295
Guess we have no choice but to ask him

39
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Tenma the doctor

40
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
Think you can take a look at them talk

41
00:04:53,887 --> 00:05:00,031
Does this hurt

42
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,431
And what about here I'm going to need plenty of hot water towels and fresh sheets

43
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
Get out of the room this could be contagious

44
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
Why don't you pretend to be sick

45
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,447
Come on show me a little Mercy

46
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,311
I must be losing my touch you're the first doctor to see through my ex so fast

47
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,407
I had it all figured out

48
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,807
If I got sent to the hospital I'd have a better chance to escape do you know what I do when I want to rob an armored truck

49
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,647
I jump out in front of the vehicle and pretend to be very sick

50
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,047
When the guards run out of the truck in a panic then my friend pops up with an automatic weapon and threatens to shoot him

51
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
I've never really killed anybody myself

52
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
That's where you and me kind of differ

53
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
So how about it

54
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
What do you say we escaped together

55
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,663
You've already got the look of a man who's never getting out of here

56
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,503
But if you stay in this dump it'll suck the life right out of you

57
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,343
I despise cramped spaces like this crappy little Rat Hole

58
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,719
My Consciousness awoke inside a coin Locker

59
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:30,143
And that total darkness my mom and pop would put me there while they went off to work

60
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,519
I waited in that Darkness for them to come and take me home each night

61
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:41,663
Let's go to Tunisia someday that's what they'd always talk about

62
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
If I would say if today goes well we're going to Tunisia

63
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
But three days went by

64
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
And they didn't return

65
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,327
Mom and pop just left me

66
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
They probably went to Tunisia by themselves

67
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
That's the place to live

68
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:11,359
As soon as I blow this joint and I'm out of these I'm going to Tunisia

69
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
You're a real mess you know that you look like a guy who's got nothing left

70
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
I live for

71
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Unlike me I got plenty of goals

72
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
What will you do if they catch you again

73
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,095
I'll just escape again keep on doing it

74
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
No matter how long it takes

75
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Now then

76
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,823
I suppose this is going to be just Another Day of Silence

77
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
The truth of the matter

78
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,735
It's even as we speak right now terrible things are happening

79
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
So I have to tell the truth

80
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
You won't believe it

81
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
You won't believe a word I say

82
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
But that won't stop me I have to keep fighting

83
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
And I'll keep on doing it no matter how long it takes

84
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
Over and over again

85
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
I'll tell you nothing but the truth

86
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,847
This court hereby sentence is the defendant to 20 years in prison

87
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
My path in life was chosen on that fateful day when my father was found guilty

88
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,647
After the war my father moved from Sudan land Czechoslovakia to Germany starting a small radio station

89
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
In there in 1949 but in the 60s during the Cold war between East and West Germany he was arrested

90
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,447
Did for being a spy and for the murder of a federal politician's secretary this news shocked the West

91
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
My father proclaimed his innocence but was convicted to 20 years in prison my

92
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:53,247
My mother believed in my father's innocence until her death in 1971 my father filled with sorrow

93
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,831
When regret died in prison a year later in 1972

94
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
In 1973

95
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,511
While I was in the gymnasium my father's innocence was proven

96
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,631
After graduating from Dusseldorf University I joined the large firm of Hoffman law

97
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,055
In my first case I defied expectations and prove the innocence of a falsely accused defendant

98
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
One after another

99
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,919
My victories in the courtroom continue to grow

100
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:28,319
Fritz verdeman wants the son of a spy and now a hero in the legal world

101
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,535
Over the Rainbow

102
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,167
Everyday the broadcast of my father's radio station would begin and end with that song

103
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Over the Rainbow

104
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
I see

105
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,543
Both you and my father lived in the east

106
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,359
So this song must have symbolized the Free World to you

107
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Yes

108
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,479
My father died before he was able to prove his innocence

109
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
To honor his memory

110
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,647
I want to be involved in as many cases as possible where the person standing trial may be falsely accused

111
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
I want you to tell me everything you know

112
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303
About Dr Timmy's case

113
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Elsa

114
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,567
How did your prenatal exam go what did they say

115
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:26,431
Everything's fine the doctor said to expect the baby any day now

116
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,503
Did you pass a man in the lobby on your way up

117
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Yes

118
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
Is he the one you mentioned earlier

119
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
He

120
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
A man by the name of Alfred ball

121
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,487
He asked me if I wanted to team up with him on the doctor Tim the murder case

122
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,839
Well if I remember correctly you already refused to take Doctor Thomas case

123
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,959
But at the time I was being solicited by Hans gay org shuval

124
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,103
And it wasn't made clear to me then why I was being asked by that business tycoon to be the doctor's legal counsel

125
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,943
However the reasons Mr ball had were all perfectly clear

126
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
What were they

127
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,343
Every one of Mr Ball's clients was a former patient of Dr Tenma

128
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,671
And he'd save the lives of all of them before he went on the Run

129
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
And now I'm certain about one thing

130
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,863
Dr timma was a well-respected and highly skilled surgeon

131
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
So are you taking the case

132
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,543
Yes but if I had made that decision when the billionaire was footing the bill we could have made quite a nice profit

133
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,943
I doubt these patients will be able to pay nearly as much

134
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,503
Then you'd have a much larger firm by now

135
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
How about that

136
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
It's playing your song Honey

137
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
Please turn it off

138
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:00,383
Just turn it off please

139
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,503
How about we go out and get ourselves some dinner

140
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,903
Carrying around another life must make you pretty hungry we better make sure you order enough food for two

141
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
The baby always kicks when it gets to be dinner time

142
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,863
So dear what restaurant would you like to go to tonight

143
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
How about that place we saw last week

144
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
And then he just

145
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
Disappeared into the blazing fire

146
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
And that was the very last time

147
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
I ever saw Johan

148
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,343
Do you want me to start my story from the beginning one more time

149
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
Because I'm going to keep on telling the truth

150
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
Over and over as long as it takes

151
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
You're the fourth one you know

152
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,935
The other three wanted to represent me all had the same suggestion that I should confess to some of the charges

153
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
Admit to part of the crimes to lighten my sentence

154
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
That's all they wanted to talk about

155
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
I'd assumed as much

156
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,175
It seems to me you don't really care too deeply about proving your innocence

157
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,551
You apparently would rather spend your time proving the existence of a certain young man named Johann

158
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
Yes that's right

159
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
Legal expertise won't help with that

160
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Dr Tenma

161
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
When did these events all start happening like I've been saying when a boy with a gunshot wound to the head was brought into the

162
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,031
No but something must have happened before that so what was it

163
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
A Turkish woman was yelling at me

164
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:50,207
But human lives are created equal

165
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:55,071
Was what I did back then

166
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,655
Really the right thing to have done I just don't know

167
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,751
There's no way of telling if a patient is good

168
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
More evil

169
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,639
My only crime is that I went ahead and saved the life of a little boy

170
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
I don't know

171
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
But

172
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:18,367
The doctor's even have the right to choose who they treat based on the quality of a patient's soul

173
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,535
People's lives aren't created equal they are always cool I can explain it

174
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,935
But I know that it's the truth it's the same way with lawyers

175
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,799
We can't tell what kind of a person the accused is

176
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:43,199
Here's a list of names of the people who asked me to represent you in these legal proceedings doctor

177
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,783
Mr McHale hotter Mr Stephen Crump

178
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
Also Mr Franz Kiefer

179
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
And Mr Rudolph Huber

180
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
Mr key for Mr hub

181

184
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
Time's up thank goodness for that they're all okay

185
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,527
Dr tinla I will accept your case I'll represent you

186
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,415
You know lawyers can't tell what's inside a client's heart either

187
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,255
There's only one thing we can do when we represent someone

188
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
Try to have faith in him

189
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
One more

190
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,311
Didn't you hear me I said one more man you've had enough

191
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,407
Since one of those bars are refusing a service Bus customer

192
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,719
Hey you just laughed at me didn't you

193
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
No

194
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,863
Not at all yes you did you looked over me with a big laugh

195
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
Hey hey I know you

196
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
You are always there

197
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:15,871
Coming to our house with your head in your hand groveling you're the vice branch manager at nordrine West

198
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
Don't give me that look

199
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,503
I can drink here if I damn well wanna

200
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,111
Whether you like it or not Eva Heineman has returned home to Dusseldorf

201
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,487
You've certainly brought me a wealth of important information

202
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Thank you Dr Wright

203
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:38,655
Listen I've been trying to reach you ever since I heard the doctor Tenma had retained you to represent him

204
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
I'm sorry you had so much trouble

205
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
I've been out investigating everywhere

206
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Investigating

207
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
That's right

208
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,919
I've been meeting with the former patients of Dr Tenma who hired me on in this case

209
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Did you learn anything

210
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,295
Well just that they think he's wonderful and that they owe their lives to him

211
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,623
Yes but did you get any evidence that would be useful

212
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
Not really

213
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,999
I'm hoping to find a witness or someone who can provide Dr Ten though with an alibi

214
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,679
In my opinion to establish tenema's innocence we need to prove to the world that Johan actually exists

215
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
Listen Dr Reich

216
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
What

217
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,847
Regarding that part about Dr Tenma planning to shoot that young man named Johann

218
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,407
When you're called to testify please omit that

219
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,831
But wait a minute my testimony about his plan is all we have to prove there is a Johann whether or not Johan exist

220
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
Best doctor Tenma is innocent

221
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,975
Please hear me out Dr Wright Vine

222
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,327
The country wants this case closed so any scapegoat will do right now

223
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
My child will be born soon

224
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,239
I want him to live in a world where True Justice exists

225
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,823
Judges and prosecutors want to bring matters to a close quickly

226
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,663
In order to do so they carelessly rush to condemn innocent people

227
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
As guilty

228
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,039
It's high time this country repented for its lack of True Justice

229
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
And that's what's most important

230
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,903
Well Dr reichvine yes

231
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
That's right

232
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,767
Anyhow I'm looking for a particular witness at the moment

233
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,119
She might know something which could prove vital to Dr tennis defense

234
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
At least I hope so

235
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Who is she

236
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,239
None other than my client's former fiance

237
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
Miss Ava Heineman

238
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,639
Is something wrong Dr reichfind you look surprised

239
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
She's here in town

240
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,271
She came here with me I guess she's decided to move back

241
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
But that woman

242
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
They were laughing

243
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
Every last one of them was laughing

244
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
They just give me one look and start in

245
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
Ava

246
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,703
Are you listening to me quit bugging me you're so annoying

247
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,287
Just meet with the lawyer won't you do at least that for 10 more

248
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Please

249
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,663
Your memory is kind of shot grams

250
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,015
I told you before I tried to shoot him once but I couldn't pull it off

251
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,855
I remember that quite well but I was surprised to hear it

252
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,671
But you didn't go through with shooting him

253
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,487
That's right I didn't shoot him

254
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
Do you know why

255
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,863
It's because I can't have him die on me yet

256
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
That man ruined my life a fast death would be too easy I want him to rotten jail for eternity to make

257
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,663
Make him regret it I'm going to lock him up for the rest of his life he'll be sorry he left me when I'm through with him

258
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,479
Yeah maybe then he'll regret that he dumped me

259
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
Passed out again

260
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,255
You were asleep you must have had a bad dream

261
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
Shots from the gun

262
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
I didn't say

263
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
I didn't

264
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,703
Didn't see it

265
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
Blonde haired man

266
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:38,527
Who did you see did you see Johanna that night

267
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Over the Rainbow

268
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,695
The song that symbolizes a great free world for all

269
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
Your wife's gone into labor

270
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
She's been taking to the hospital Mr Vermont

271
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
What

272
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,983
I've got to be there Mr Cleaner contact Mr ball immediately

273
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,335
Ask him if he'll be able to meet with Dr Tenma in my place because I'm having a baby

274
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Nice to meet you

275
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
I'm Alfred ball

276
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,015
Mr verdeman asked me if I could come meet with you today

277
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
How are you doing

278
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,343
Getting enough sleep in this place

279
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
I guess

280
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
Well that's good

281
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,792
I used to be right-handed actually

282
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,656
I'm still having a little trouble adjusting to holding a pen in my left right

283
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
You see

284
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,008
My right hand doesn't work too well anymore

285
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
Perhaps you remember me now

286
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
I know

287
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Lost quite a bit of weight

288
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,040
Yep I got to admit I even impressed myself

289
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,880
To think that I was able to escape that sea of smoking fire

290
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:53,280
You call me by surprise when you actually shot me

291
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,408
No it's kind of funny I can't seem to hold pens worth a damn but

292
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:16,064
And I'm able to handle a gun just fine to tell you the truth I'm thinking of killing

293
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,464
I'm thinking of killing your former fiance the lovely Ava he
