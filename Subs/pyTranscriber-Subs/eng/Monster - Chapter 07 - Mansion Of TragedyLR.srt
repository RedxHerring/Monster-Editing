I'm assuming neither of you saw the intrud

39
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Do then to think something like that could happen in such a peaceful

40
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551

They got a call but who could have called phone

51
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
There were no Sirens when they first came and

52
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
They took us away before making sure the backup arrived at the scene but

53
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
Dispatches those badges did look real

54
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
It can't be

55
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951

Wow you got a new car really nice

00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
I'm sure we'll get it banged up soon enough

64
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
Yeah we really give our rides a workout

65
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
Excuse me Detective

00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,759

Sure you go ahead

69
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,535
Are these two in some kind of trouble

70
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
Trouble not at all it's nothing don't worry

71
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
What's going on here

72
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
What about that blood

73
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Who could have called them

74
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
There's Sirens weren't even on

75
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
What should we do

76
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
Hey what's wrong Dr Tina are you two okay

77
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
How do you know who I am

78
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
I gave you my name but I never told you not once that I was a doctor tell me how did you know that

79
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
I found a grocery store nearby

80
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
I also got you some dry clothes

81
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
There's bread sausage and cheese

82
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
And I felt this thermos up with hot coffee too

83
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,359
You probably don't have much of an appetite but you really should eat

84
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
You're shivering

85
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
You should change out of those wet clothes

86
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
A

87
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
People were dead

88
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
My brother and I

89
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
We're walking

90
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
It was like

91
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
We are all alone in the world

92
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
Where were you when all of this happened can you remember anything else

93
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
We crossed the border

94
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
Uncle and auntie helped

95
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
They were so kind to

96
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
And my brother said

97
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
I have a good plan

98
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Soon after that

99
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
My uncle and my dear auntie were both

100
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
Anyone who is ever good to us died

101
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
Without fail

102
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
All of them

103
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
But then one day

104
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
One day I discovered the reason why

105
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Rainy day

106
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,383
You're talking about the incident with Mr and Mrs leebert

107
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
My brother did it he shut them

108
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Brother

109
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
He murdered

110
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,231
He's the one who did all this my brother murdered them all

111
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
So I picked up the gun with both my hands

112
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
And then I I aimed it right at my brother

113
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
And that's when he said it

114
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
He was smiling

115
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,991
After you shoot me make sure that you throw the gun out the window

116
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
And he told me to aim for his head

117
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
Who shot him like he said

118
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
I aim for his head like he told me

119
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
Why did you save him

120
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,895
If you hadn't saved your mom and dad would still be alive he wouldn't

121
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
Stay here I'm going to the police

122
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
If those detectives last night were real

123
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
It means that some members of the police force are linked to Gohan if so we can't just

124
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Wait here like this

125
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:48,479
Nina I need you to listen to me I know that Johan is going to come after you if anyone comes

126
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
You're just hide

127
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,695
Why don't you have some food drink some hot coffee and then try to get a couple hours of rest

128
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,535
One step at a time that's how we'll get through all this

129
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,607
You're alive

130
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:10,239
You must think about the future your future

131
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
Were there any clues left by the Killer is there any connection to the serial murders throughout

132
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:23,039
Germany like I said we're doing everything we can to investigate this case but I can't make

133
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:29,439
Make any comments or talk about details

134
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:35,839
Time or is she presumed that as well we're trying to figure out her whereabouts why was that newspaper reporter with them Mister mower

135
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:41,727
Cheap one question who was that Japanese man who said to have been with it question mark

136
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
Who is he he sounds suspicious

137
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,687
Quick question Chief is this murder at all related to the one that took place at Heidelberg Castle around the same time

138
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
Heidelberg Castle

139
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
So he was killed tomorrow

140
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
That's all for now we'll release additional details and due time

141
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:11,167
Excuse me sir

142
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
Of course we appreciate all the support we're getting from Manheim like detectives Messner and Mueller thank you

143
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,151
We both were coming out this afternoon

144
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,247
We're at your disposal to Aid in the investigation anything we can do to help

145
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,831
So how are things coming along sir

146
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,415
Please come inside that way we will be able to speak freely

147
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
One more

148
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
For real

149
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,959
Those guys were with the police their actual cops

150
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Should I do

151
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
Hello Heidelberg post

152
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,527
What I can't hear you we're really busy in here

153
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:04,927
Just find out Japanese

154
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:11,327
I'm bringing an important witness to your office at

155
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
5:00

156
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:17,983
But you must not tell the police

157
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,591
If I can't trust the police then the newspaper is my only option

158
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
Only they can help Nina now

159
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Mr Maher

160
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,023
I'm sorry but you just can't come in here without permission

161
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
He's right

162
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,143
Besides the bka is only working on the serial murders of the middle-aged couples

163
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:50,495
All that you're going to find in this room is material for the murder of the castle inspector long gay

164
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Please forgive me

165
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,991
I was just a bit curious but the crime you're investigating in this one happened at the same time

166
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Detective

167
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
I mean it couldn't have been the same murder

168
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
So I see

169
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
It appears that this man had been tied up

170
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
You didn't happen to find a rope or anything nearby did you

171
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
No

172
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,631
Seems the body had already been untied by the time the police arrived on the scene

173
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
I see

174
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
Yes

175
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
There are four possible routes of Escape From The Scene he also had to stay well out of sight

176
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
How crowded was the area where he'd come out and how much light was there

177
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,903
Here it is

178
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,303
Nina it's me Tema I'm back Nina you can come out now

179
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,655
It's all right hey Nina

180
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Oh no

181

Nina

183
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Where are you

184
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
Nina

185
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
He came for you

Disney Nina

187
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
I never should have left you here all alone

188
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,159
After 10

189
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,024
I don't blame you for saving my brother's life anymore

190
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
You did what you had to do as a doctor

191
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
It wasn't your fault

192
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,192
Please eat the sandwiches

193
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
Get some rest too

194
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Please live on

195
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,200
And continue to save as many people as you are able to

Nina

198
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
Are you planning to do

199
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,872
Are you going to kill your brother second time

200
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
I did it I brought him back to life that monster

201
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:21,440
It was me I brought

202
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Back to life
