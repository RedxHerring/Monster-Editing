1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:07,168
This news story about the police just keeps getting worse and worse any new info coming in

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,568
Yeah that was the police calling to say they're holding a press conference about the case at 3:00 p.m.

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,408
No my years I've never seen a case it's crazy is this

4
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,624
No don't tell me you've been here looking through those documents since I left you last night

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,560
Yes but it looks like I found that article I was looking for thanks for all your help

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,352
Hey you're welcome glad it worked out

7
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:40,448
Oh one second I've got a question right now

8
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,472
I know

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
In this article I found there's this Mr X

10
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
Mr X huh that's right 3 years ago your paper ran an expose entitled the truth about the former

11
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
Czechoslovakian secret police

12
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
Oh yeah

13
00:00:54,016 --> 00:01:00,160
That article explained how after the wall fell that instead of pulling back the German right Wingers and the former checklist of Locke

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
Secret police extended their influence even more by organizing crime syndicates as a matter of fact I'm the guy who wrote it

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,840
You wrote this article

16
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:13,984
Well what would it take for you to introduce me to that check secret police agent you interviewed the man you referred to as Mr X

00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,080
You said before that you're a special correspondent hear from Japan

18
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,920
So enlighten me why would you want to have an interview with our Mr X anyway

19
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,480
Oh well he's newsworthy

20
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
I'm sure the folks back home would be interested in finding out about how abductions imprisonment and other things were done here during the

21
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,464
World War I got to tell you those guys are crazy

22
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,048
I feel like I really risked my life to do that interview back then

23
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
They're still very dangerous

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,448
And they're still very active based on what just went down

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776

You always like playing cops and robbers at that same place

00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
What place are you talking about

72
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,127
You may like to think of it as your own little Hideout son but I know all about it

73
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,199
The abandoned building on Bruno Street

74
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
You found out about it

75
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
That's right

76
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
I certainly did

77
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
Take care

78
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,279
Now don't go getting hurt son be sure to come home in time for dinner

79
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
Once Upon a Time

80
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
In a land far away

81
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
There lived

82
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
A nameless monster

83
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
The monster

84
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
Was dying to have a name

85
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,927
Once Upon a Time

86
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
Inland far away

87
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
The nameless monster

88
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
I figured I'd bring you some food

89
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
And the latest newspaper

90
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,663
You're getting to be quite a celebrity you know that

91
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Tell me

92
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:54,111
Are you concerned someone will find that tape and research papers from the safety deposit box that I sent to my mother

93
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Well one thing's for certain

94
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
They're a lot safer with your mom than if we had them here with us

95
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
After reading all about what happened

96
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,655
I have to say it's amazing to me how much your situation reminds me of that other incident it's uncann

97
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
What incident

98
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,543
I'm referring to something that happened in Dusseldorf about 10 years ago

99
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,663
This one Hospital's director and two other doctors died after ingesting poisoned candy

100
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,247
The main suspect of the time was a promising young neurosurgeon

101
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
What ended up happening to him

102
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
Four guys been on the run ever since he's still trying to prove he's innocent

103
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
You're still in good shape you

104
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
After all you have me as a witness

105
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,263
You mean you actually saw her she was coming down the stairs of my apartment

106
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
That I did

107
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Our Infamous blonde Beauty

108
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:53,247
But even if that woman really is the murderer if we can't find her we have nothing come down suke no

109
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,087
Have you seen it from now on we're stuck being on the Run why did all this happen to me

110
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
What the hell did I ever do to deserve this crap

111
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Take it easy

112
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:06,815
Are you saying it from this moment on you expect me to just disappear off the face of the Earth cool it come on

113
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Put together

114
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,887
I've told you how to handle this haven't I

115
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,471
Remember when I told you the only one you can believe in is yourself

116
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Good

117
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
That's much better

118
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
No let's eat

119
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
He

120
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,831
When I was little I used to come here and play cops and robbers

121
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
And that's very room

122
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
That

123
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
What was the police inspector's desk

124
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
It's hard to believe that it's still here

125
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
Just as it was

126
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,215
I would sit behind this desk and give out orders to everyone

127
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Just like on TV

128
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
Gentleman

129
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
This case is a real tough one

130
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
But all of us must do our very best

131
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,711
In the name of Justice we must Prevail today

132
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
We can't let evil run rampant

133
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
Feels like old times

134
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,911
Soak

135
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
Stay still

136
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:26,175
We're surrounded

137
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
Don't worry Sue I got you it's got you away from the window and behind this desk

138
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,439
That's fine you're probably in shock

139
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,511
Question is who shot at us

140
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,191
Where are they shooting at us from

141
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,775
That shot didn't hit any vital organs you're going to be fine

142
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
I need to borrow your gun

143
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:09,695
The tape

144
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
Raw soup

145
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,111
Purpose missing his heart now on purpose

146
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:45,279
Give us the tape God they're going to shut both of

147
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:53,471
Tell me grandma okay I'm going to work my way over

00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,343
Talking about it's a problem

155
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
No it's your favorite

156
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,535

We took care of them

172
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Two of our guys charge that building

173
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
The detective and tall guy

174
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
I've already been wiped out

175
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
I'm too damn late

176
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959

179
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,791
The Magnificent Steiner right

180
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,119
It's the Magnificent Steiner folks

181
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
He's done it once again

182
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
What happened

183
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
Hello Dr Tenma

184
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
I'm glad that you showed up when you did

185
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
Could you save his life please

186
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
Who cares a fine young policeman

187
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
So please do whatever you can to help him pull through

188
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
He's not the only one who needs a doctor

189
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
Who did this

190
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Do you know

191
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
Guess it was probably me

192
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
Or my other half rather

193
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
The one that's deep down inside of me

194
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
See doctor

195
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,831
I was one of those special children at 511 kinderheim

196
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
I was glued to that TV whenever I had the chance to watch the magn

197
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
Jefferson Steiner in action the main character on the show was a frail young man

198
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
The bad guys would always Corner him at the worst possible moment but before you knew it

199
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,271
The Magnificent Steiner would appear and flatten all the villains

200
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,671
I didn't realize it at first but the Magnificent Steiner start

201
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:11,071
Showing up in my life for real whenever I was in real danger it appear in Rescue Me

202
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,375
Feed all the bad guys

203
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,543
The only vivid memory that I still have from being a child was watching The Magnificent Steiner on TV

204
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,175
That's it all of my other memories were taken away

205
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,759
Every last one of them lives clean out of my mind

206
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,063
At 511 kinderheim

207
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
Listen to me babbling away like this

208
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,559
I mean you don't want to hear about my past that has nothing to do with you all right I've treated him as best I can

209
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
Thank you doctor

210
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
So do you think you'll pull through

211
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
All of the bullets that hit him pass through cleanly but the wound that runs from the auxiliary artery to the brachial art

212
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
Serious

213
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,175
That's something I tied on him should keep enough pressure on it to stop the bleeding

214
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,735
That's all I can do for now but he's in shock

215
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,807
We have to get him to a hospital as soon as possible

216
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,879
Mr Grimmer

217
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,535
You just said that your past doesn't involve me but it does more than you can know

218
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,143
Especially 511 kinderhan

219
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
Now let's get an ambulance for soup

220
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:30,175
Where's the guy that's hurt there are three men in there we're going to need another ambulance call dispatch

221
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:36,575
How bad off are they pretty bad we need to move them but but what well what's wrong these guys have already received

222
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,951
First day and proper first aid at that wait you're saying somebody already took care of them

223
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
Grandma look at me the news

224
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,959
Oh yeah what are they saying

225
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,775
They're speaking check so I can't follow it

226
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,591
But I found out the name of the hospital where they're being kept

227
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
It's yakubazemi Memorial

228
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,503
Once the ID suit the police are probably going to arrest him

229
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,807
It's a sad State of Affairs

230
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
6

231
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
He is

232
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,999
I wonder if I should go and testify

233
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,095
So then doctor Tenma

234
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,447
How on Earth did you know we talk about what you were saying earlier please

235
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
There's something I need to know more about Grimmer

236
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
511 kinderheim

237
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,407
Actually I don't really remember being there

238
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
I don't remember that period I can only remember the fragments

239
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
Dark hallways

240
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:57,215
A stain on the ceiling sound of

241
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,615
Squeaking smell of my multi bed

242
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
The memories came back to me at least a little bit

243
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,503
After I was finally freed from that orphanage

244
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,855
I can almost hear someone saying I was 14 years old

245
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,208
Now that I think back to them when I was first enrolled in that strange School

246
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,768
They went and gave me a brand new name

247
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,352
It's only then that I became Wolfgang Grimmer

248
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:31,008
The place where they chose to raise me was this totally artificial neighborhood

249
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,432
That little bubble was our whole world and we weren't allowed out there was some man playing the father figure

250
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
And a woman to play the mother too they taught me languages there

251
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,696
English Spanish French I could speak read or write them all

252
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:56,096
You were trained to be a spy I must admit the schooling they gave me did serve me pretty well

253
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,680
The toughest thing to master

254
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:06,336
Was just learning how to smile now then we have to go

255
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,896
Go to the hospital where they're keeping soup

256
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:15,296
Mr Grimmer they had your picture in the paper they want you as a witness in this case you know that

257
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
I know

258
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,392
But I'm the only one who can prove suk's innocence
