1
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,752
No class

2
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:17,152
I want you to tell me what was the basis for the ruling the judge made in regards to the 19

3
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,432
The age Stuttgart

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:24,576
Oh boy what is this silence why are we some kind of a monastery

5
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,416
Mr Reimer

6
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,488
I'd like to hear your answer if you have one

7
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
Well sir

8
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
That is to say I anyone

9
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,704
Is there anyone in this room who can break this silence

10
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,736
So The Chronic light coming is here at last

11
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,296
You're 13 minutes tardy

12
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,392
Send your part-time pizza delivery job kept you awfully busy today

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,184
I'm sorry

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,232
Professor

15
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,072
Well let me ask you a question before you sit down

16
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:12,960
Do you have enough strength left to tell me the basis for the ruling in the 1968 Stuttgart case

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
Oh yes

18
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
Well

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
The defense claim

20
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,688
That the kidnapping was a sham

21
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,760
And the victim's death have been to the poisoning

22
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,576
After an investigation into the crime scene

23
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,136
It was found that the victim's death had been accidental

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
And that there was no motive

25
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
So

26
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,024
Since the crime couldn't be proven to be an intentional murder

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096
I believe a sentence of 15 years was handed down

28
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Very good

29
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,032
You can take your seat Nina for tonight

30
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Yes professor

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
Wow good job Nina

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,224
If no one had been able to give him the answer I have no doubt that kronecker would have probably demanded we write a 50 page report

33
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
50 pages if we were lucky

34
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,600
I'll have to treat Our Savior Nina to something to eat

35
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,672
What are you say Nina a nice meal Just the Two of Us

36
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,792
Oh I'm sorry Peter but I have a club meeting today bye

37
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,144
She turned you down again

38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
Hey Peter how many times was that come on shut up as if one of you losers could actually score a date with her

39
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,744
Oh my gosh if I'm late

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
My deliveries the manager is going to be furious

41
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,175
Hi I'm home

42
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,807
Boy am I hungry oh my the neighbors can probably hear you you are such a child

43
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
Go and wash your hands dear

44
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Yes ma'am

45
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
Hey Mom you dyed your hair

46
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
What do you think

47
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
At your age

48
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,935
I don't think you should be dying your hair such a bright color I don't agree with you dad I think mom looks great

49
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,495
Looks like she's going to some costume parade

50
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
It's nice to know mom is still young

51
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
Hi Dad

52
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
Oh and that reminds me speaking of costumes

53
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,783
I saw some kids dressed up from head to toe today

54
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,623
Oh yes today supposed to be the same Hadrian costume parade

55
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,207
I wish I had dressed up like that when I was a little girl

56
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
They were so adorable

57
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
Yeah you did dress up in a costume once

58
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,239
Isn't that right dear that's right I completely forgotten really

59
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
Let's see it's around here

60
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,615
Oh look here it is

61
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
He was so cute

62
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Yes I did

63
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
You are so excited and made such a fuss

64
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,207
Isn't that right dear yeah I remember

65
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
Costume parade huh

66
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
Distance spring

67
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,807
I forlornly wait for a spring that will never come

68
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Hannah

69
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Moana

70
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
When you get over your break up already

71
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,607
I shall send you the most beautiful flowers

72
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,679
I was born to smother you with flowers

73
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
So beautiful

74
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Wow

75
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
I wonder who sent this

76
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Ah

77
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
I'm very impressed with you Peter

78
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
So

79
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
How have you been Nina

80
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Well

81
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,855
I've been very well lately Dr guidel

82
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
That's good to hear

83
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:57,023
But of course I could tell just by the look on your face when you came into this session that you were doing well

84
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
So

85
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
Tell me are you still having that nightmare

86
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,727
The one about the monster emerging from the darkness

87
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,823
I've been sleeping very well I've been so busy I don't have time to dream

88
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,663
I wonder why I was playing by such a dream night after night

89
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,991
It's common for students to feel fear and anxiety

90
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,831
Expectations of the future mix up with other insecurities

91
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,415
People end up confused losing sight of who they are

92
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,791
But who you are is something you can spend your whole life trying to grasp and never figure out completely

93
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,119
We're always projecting and trying to look into the future

94
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,215
We spend our whole lives looking for the answers and we do the best we can

95
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
Right and that's what I'm doing

96
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
I want to become a federal prosecutor

97
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
That's very good

98
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
All right I think that brings us to the end of our session

99
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
Bye and thank you doctor

100
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
Nina Fortuner

101
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
Such a cheerful girl

102
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,095
I can't help thinking that she's overcompensating or running from something

103
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Something

104
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,215
Overwhelmingly dark

105
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
What do you mean what

106
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
Don't act so innocent

107
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
What in the world are you going on about

108
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
I was born to smother you with flowers

109
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,063
I would never have guessed in a million years you had such talent for writing poetry

110
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
I don't know what you're talking about

111
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,719
I wouldn't be able to come up with really stuff like that even if I stood on my head

112
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Then who was it

113
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,607
I only give my email address to friends and no one else

114
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Beats me

115
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,543
Damn it what this means is some Suave poetry guys honing in on my girl

116
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Hello

117
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
How could it be

118
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,783
This was a bizarre murder that took place in Munich

119
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
After shooting the parents to death

120
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,927
The perpetrators strangled there to children with a rope

121
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Grizzly really

122
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,815
No I would like you to explain the verdict

123
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
Using the records from all of the hearings

124
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
Nina Fortuner

125
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
What do you not understand the question

126
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
No

127
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
The trial was focused mainly

128
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
On the cold blooded murder

129
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
Of an entire family

130
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
So not even Nina has all the answers huh

131
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
Nina and what's wrong Nina

132
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Are you all right

133
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
You want to go see the nurse

134
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
I'm all right

135
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
I just felt a little ill that's all

136
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
I was just

137
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
Listening to the professor

138
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
You mean that question about that murdered family

139
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
Don't say that

140
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Is that it

141
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
I thought you were awfully brave but I guess

142
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
You're pretty sensitive too

143
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,591
Did you watch a horror movie that totally scared you when you were a kid or something

144
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,431
I know exactly what that counselor Dr guidel would say

145
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,759
If you get back to the root of it I think that you'll find

146
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,831
It was nothing significant now go back to your childhood

147
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Am I right

148
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
That's it

149
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
I have no

150
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
I remember nothing before the age of 10

151
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
Where are my memories

152
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
My childhood memories

153
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Yes

154
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,031
Those two were indeed a very nice couple

155
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
To think that they died in such a way

156
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Children

157
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,807
Now that you mentioned it yes there was a son his name was Michael I do believe

158
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
He was there for a year or two

159
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Let's see a boy

160
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
Do you remember if there was a boy

161
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Yes there was

162
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Wasn't his name Michael

163
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
He was 14 give or take

164
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Michael you say

165
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
Yeah I think I remember him

166
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
But

167
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Why

168
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Who are you the police

169
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,055
Yes Michael Redman

170
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,895
I remember him vaguely but he was a student in my classroom

171
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,319
He didn't leave much of an impression I'm embarrassed to say it but honestly I don't remember him very well

172
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
I'm not sure if he had any friends

173
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
You see there are no records left from then

174
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,791
Everything went up in a fire about 6 years ago now

175
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,727
They're definitely was a boy named Michael living here in

176
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:32,127
Until 6 years ago and Michael's real name is

177
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:38,527
You hun huh yes there was a time when I went by that name

178
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,927
Are you what does it matter what's the use he's a serial killer

179
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
In order of twin siblings that's all there is to it nothing else

180
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,911
What am I doing

181
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:06,175
Twins his sister where did his twin sister go

182
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:12,575
I will pick you up very soon who is this he'll be picking me up very soon

183
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
But what does that mean

184
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
A child

185
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,399
Oh yes there was a boy about seven or eight years ago and Mrs hyena had taken a boy in

186
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
Before they were killed

187
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
And what was he like

188
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
What was he like

189
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
That was quite a long time ago

190
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,895
And I think he only really lived with them for about a year or so

191
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
I honestly don't remember anything about him

192
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
Wait do you remember if this boy had a sister no only the boy listen I just want to forget about

193
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,975
What happened to that poor couple after all those horrible things happened I almost moved away

194
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,471
I remember that boy very well

195
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
Why don't you come up

196
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
I was about to have some tea

197
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Come in have a

198
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,623
Yes thank you

199
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,951
I was wondering just have a seat

200
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
Go ahead absentee

201
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:54,463
Thank you sir

202
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
You're a doctor right that boy was the one who told me you are

203
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,055
Dr tinma

204
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
He's coming to pick you up

205
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Who is he

206
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
I have no idea who he is

207
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
It was just an anonymous email

208
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
Aw you look so happy

209
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,671
You're not thinking this is Prince Charming on a white charger or a knight in shining armor coming for you are you

210
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Why are you jealous

211
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,279
There you go Nina daydreaming again

212
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,119
It said I was born to smother you with flowers

213
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,703
Come on that's so corny how many boys do you know who write like that

214
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
Oh

215
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
Hold on wait

216
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,847
There is a new guy in our class you know who I'm talking about

217
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Oh I've seen him

218
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,015
He's the guy who sits quietly in that legendary Seton room 12 where you're bound to be called

219
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,135
That's right and you want to know what else

220
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,719
He is always staring at Nina the entire class

221
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
He's the one what do you mean

222
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,351
Come on you know Prince Charming who else

223
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:13,567
All I know is that boy was extremely grateful to you yes Dr tema

224
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:18,687
He told me more than once it because you saved his life you meant more to him than his parents

225
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,991
What name did he go by then

226
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Fronts

227
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,087
Then what he did tell me it wasn't his real name

228
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,463
If he opened up enough to tell you that much it means he must have really trusted you

229
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,607
He just showed up one day out of nowhere really

230
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,703
Mr and Mrs heinek who lived across the hole took him in

231
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,007
He lived with them for about a year

232
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
No

233
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:51,455
Actually it was it was a 14 months to be precise from March 1987

234
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,503
Happened to April 1988

235
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,087
And then one day out of the blue he suddenly vanished it

236
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,159
It really was very bright that boy

237
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
Very well manner

238
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,279
Did he visit you in your apartment very often

239
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
Everyday

240
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,887
I live alone so I always welcome to company

241
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
He said in that chair

242
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,775
And would spend most of his time studying

243
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:20,639
He was able to master the English and French that I taught him in no time

244
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,759
By the time he disappeared he was completely fluent in both languages

245
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
He was only 12 years old

246
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,719
Can you tell me if there's anything else you remember about him anything

247
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,303
He was always interested in listening to my stories

248
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,911
And what kind of stories do you think he liked best to go on take a wild guess

249
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,287
You like my War Stories War Stories

250
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
During World War II

251
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,991
I was on the crew of a U-Boat the boy's favorite store it was about the time we

252
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,319
We were attacked by a destroyer of the Allied Forces

253
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:06,207
We were the depth of 120 M that's when we were attacked by the enemy

254
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:12,607
We had suffered a mortal blow that we just kept going we all waited and teared inside that cre

255
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
Boat enduring hour after hour

256
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,799
We had to endure that hell for the day and a half

257
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
Any ordinary child would have probably looked at this as another adventure story but

258
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:34,367
That boy was different what he was most interested in was my description of ultim

259
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:40,767
Sia yes ultimate fear that reaction of people on the verge of death

260
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:47,167
He toyed with fear

261
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,567
So what

262
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,967
What was the expression on his face as he listened he probably had it gleam in his eye

263
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
Smile I imagine imagine well I cannot see Dr Denmark

264
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,767
So no I don't know the boys real name nor obviously do I have any idea

265
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
Looks like for that matter earlier you suggested the boy trusted me because he told me fr

266
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:25,567
Wasn't his real name I can assure you that he doesn't trust anyone there's only one person

267
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:31,967
Boys trusted in his life and that's his sister listen I need to help I'm

268
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:38,367
Looking for that sister he said he would go get her when she turns 20

269
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,975
In Heidelberg

270
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
See you later

271
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,607
Be careful on your scooter honey

272
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631

273
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447

276
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807

278
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
I know

279
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
We made an agreement

280
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
We said we'd tell her on her 20th birthday

281
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
That she isn't our real daughter

282
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:31,103
Hold on a second I'm not sure I can do this what are you talking about you wanted to meet

283
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,503
He told him you wait from here it's better you didn't know don't mess it up you're about to meet Prince Charming

284
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,903

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,303

286
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,703

00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:09,503
