1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,888
Hey wait up

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,192
What the hell are we doing here anyway

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:13,312
Come on let's get out of here I don't give up there's no use for this guy

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,616
Guess I'll be starving and bro forever

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,688
Only I still had that rock

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
Damn it

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,136
The hell's that supposed to be

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
A message

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
The monster inside me

10
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
About to explode what is this supposed to mean he has a

11
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,200
Personality

12
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664
Let's see if I got this

13
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,992
So you told us when you arrived at the warehouse

14
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,088
You witnessed the Asian man in the arsonist engaging in a verbal argument

15
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,696
According to your statement on it as soon as the Asian man saw you there he quickly fled

16
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,768
So Ms Liebert is that exactly how you saw it

17
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
Yes sir

18
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,912
Well it's good that Firebug ended up turning himself in

19
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
You confess that he's a right-wing extremist said he was celebrating his people when he let the fire anyway Ms Libra

20
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,920
Records clean so that's all we need from you today we do appreciate your cooperation

21
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
So then you're saying that I can go home now Detective

22
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Yes ma'am

23
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Oh hold on

24
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:14,560
There's one thing I forgot to ask about the townsfolk refer to the Asian man you mentioned is Dr tin

25
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Ms Lieber

26
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,680
You wouldn't happen to know anything else about this guy would you

27
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,776
No I don't know anything about him

28
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
Tell me what are you thinking

29
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:36,064
I'd say from the way Ms Liebert was dressed she might just be a high-class call girl

30
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
That isn't what I meant

31
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,184
I'm talking about Dr tinma

32
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,816
When we first spoke to the church from that District all of them referred to our Asian guys Dr Ten

33
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,704
But as soon as we told them the doctor was under investigation and suspected to be a serial killer

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
They got real tight left

35
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
All of a sudden none of them knew who he was

36
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,600
They told me I'm responsible for you now

37
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
Mr Russo

38
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
Yeah it's so great to see you I was worried about you when

39
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735
Now that's more like it

40
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:42,111
Now you look more like the honor I've always known I like you better in casual clothes

41
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
Come on sit down and eat I ordered what you like enjoy

42
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
So aren't you going to eat

43
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,911
No thanks dear I've already eaten I'll just have me some coffee

44
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
Go on dig in thank you I am pretty hungry

45
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:15,903
What's so funny

46
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,375
Well that's what tastes best I say coffee isn't any good at all if it isn't sweet

47
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:33,823
It's good to see you can smile

48
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
It's good to see you can smile

49
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,343
I know you're in the middle of a big job interview and up to now you've looked quite serious

50
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,183
Put your smiled when you saw me put all that sugar in my coffee

51
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,999
Your names on

52
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
My name is Anna Liebert

53
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
So

54
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,679
Well miss Liebert the job's yours

55
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
Don't start today

56
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:07,103
Having a young lady like you waiting tables in my Cafe might give my business quite a boost

57
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
EX

58
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Except

59
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Do me a favor

60
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Show off that smile a little more all right

61
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
When you smile it'll make everyone feel good

62
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
Thank you so much for the job I'll work very hard really

63
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:30,143
This is an Italian restaurant in a small town two tables of folks this is busy as it gets

64
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
Donna come stand over here

65
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407

00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:48,319
I'll place all the orders here on the bar and you'll take them from here to the customer's tables

67
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,391
All used plates go on that side of the counter

68
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
The wine is right here

69
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
And the glassware is back here

70
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,119
You'll find more bottles of wine Above This shelf and you're going to hang the food orders on these little hooks

71
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,263
So more wine is above the shelf and glassware is back there

72
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Morning Russo

00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847

You really mean it

82
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
Hey Anna how about a nice plate of carbonara hey Anna I think I'll have a Bolognese

83
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327

88
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
Hey Russo come on you got to tell us how you trick this cutie into working here for you I didn't have

89
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
If you're free tonight how about you let me take you out to a real restaurant it'll be fun just

90
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
Forget about trying to make time with my Anna I'd hate to have to hurt you oh boy listen to The Cry Baby Ross so

91
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:22,431
Everybody suddenly acting all tough hey where do you get a load of this last week he was at my house watching a TV movie

92
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
Calling like a baby

93
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
Another order of squid in crisotto

94
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
Summertime is playing across the street

95
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,495
That old movie house is screening summertime see you there

96
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
What a city Frankfurt has

97
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,343
Many great old movie theaters that movie was on TV just last week that one really brings me

98
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
Me to tears

99
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,255
Have you ever seen summertime it's touching

100
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,607
The whole thing takes place in Italy actually in the city of Venice

101
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
Folks don't know the history of Venice it was a port city back in medieval days and everyone called it the city of

102
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,943
The entire city of Venice was originally built on a lagoon there are these canals that run

103
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
Do the whole thing

104
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,575
I'd really like to go see it with you someday it's just beautiful

105
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
It sounds to me like you've been there before

106
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
I have

107
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,255
The film soundtrack is great music it's very well composed

108
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
I bet you've heard it's theme song

109
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,143
I'd say most folks have heard it it was a popular very well known song

110
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
Tell me how does it go

111
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Let's see

112
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,551
Hey I know let's go across the street and see it right now we've missed some but they'll still let us in

113
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
My life

114
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,999
Some other time it is kind of late and you're still eating

115
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
Sorry

116
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
Well I'm back

117
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Great

118
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,223
So how was your break

119
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
No thanks I can handle it

120
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,367
I appreciate you letting me take off a few hours from work every afternoon

121
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,463
That's no problem it's always slow around this time of the day

122
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,815
And I don't want to be nosy but

123
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
Where do you go everyday

124
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,031
Hey forget I ask

125
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
It's your private time it's none of my business where you go

126
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Good morning how to shoot a gun

127
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:10,367
Oh learning to shoot

128
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,439
You're learning at wrinkles Place huh

129
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,511
He's good people

130
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,919
Tell me Mr Russo have you ever shot a gun before

131
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
Me shooting guns no way honestly I get all nervous just looking at them

132
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,999
Here you go sir enjoy thank you very much

133
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:35,263
How do I do this time take a taste

134
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
No you should try it

135
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
Tell me what's it taste like

136
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
Like there's some garlic olive oil parsley and not much else

137
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
We're gone right

138
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,887
That just means you're having learned how to make it proper

139
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
This cooking stuff

140
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
Anything worth learning takes practice

141
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
I'm all done with the bathroom Mr Rosso

142
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
I'm heading for bed now so

143
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,519
When I was younger I never realized that movies like this existed

144
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
Mr Rosso

145
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
Movies have always affected you deeply

146
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
That's true

147
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:01,023
When I was younger I always wanted to watch movies but with work I never had the time to

148
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,703
Back then I ate a lot of fabulous meals but to be really honest I never felt any of them had any taste

149
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Flavor

150
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,543
I didn't even appreciate the taste of sugar then

151
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
Really is that the truth

152
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
You know my past

153
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,039
Isn't that right Anna

154
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,855
Well after you left I checked up on you

155
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
And I know what happened

156
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:37,119
You really need a Fortuner

157
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,959
You disappeared 2 years ago after your parents were murdered

158
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,871
Exactly what were you looking for me to do what

159
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:54,271
Looking for me to do a hit or did you want me to teach you to kill

160
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:59,135
I guess I wanted to learn from you that was it

161
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,023
So how did you find out about me and what I did

162
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,167
From one of my professors at law school he had done research on you and all the cases you were involved in

163
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
The restaurant in Nino case

164
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
Osaka Milano case

165
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,823
A sub 18 murder case

166
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,919
You were called into court to testify in all three of those murder cases

167
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
And in each of those cases

168
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,807
All charges were dropped due to a complete lack of evidence

169
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,439
However my professor came up with a theory about it that made sense

170
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
There was only one conclusion

171
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,399
A world class Hitman committed all three of the murders and he said that you

172
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
You were that man

173
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,695
I suppose you want to know how many people I

174
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
To be honest with you I can't even remember

175
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
I was never a good kid

176
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,239
And before I knew what was what I was in way over my head

177
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,335
Robbery blackmail if you can name it then I did it

178
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,407
And eventually I became a hitman

179
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,807
I rewarded Myself by eating very well

180
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:43,839
I never had any feelings about it it was just my job

181
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
I was wondering I was doing

182
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
Doing what I always did waiting to kill some faceless guy

183
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:22,239
It was sunny and he was

184
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:30,687
I've been doing it so long I was numb I didn't know how many I killed or who was next

185
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,015
I had him as good as Dad

186
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:40,415
He had ordered a coffee and as I watched he started putting sugar in it

187
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
One spoonful two spoonfuls

188
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:53,215
Three four after the

189
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
5th spoonful he stopped black moment started me finally tasting the

190
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
Coffee I drink when I saw how he was enjoy

191
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,159
Good coffee I couldn't do it

192
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
That was the day I put my gun down for good

193
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
That part of my life is done

194
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,615
I know I can't kill people and steal their Simple Pleasures

195
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
After all the time we spent together I don't get it

196
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,551
You never asked me to teach you how to kill someone

197
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
I decided

198
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,255
I decided that getting you involved wouldn't be right

199
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,575
Do you really have to go Nina

200
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
Goodbye

201
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,704
Thank you for everything Mr Rosso

202
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,800
You should know killing is easier than you think

203
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
You just have to forget how sweet the sugar is
