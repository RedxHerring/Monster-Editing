1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:03,328
At least I can do is buy you a bus ticket

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,864
You know

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:10,496
There's still time for you to turn yourself in and prove your innocence I promise I can help you

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:16,896
The truth is I'm not chasing after your hunt just so I can prove my innocence

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,224
Thank you for all your help Rudy

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,344
You don't have to become him to end this

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624
That reminds me

8
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,696
I really didn't despise you back in college rud

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,048
I thought you were brilliant and it was a shame we never had a chance to talk

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,120
I'm glad that I can finally count you as a friend

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,728
But I know you caught me cheating on that medical logs and Professor hesse's class

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,664
Well yeah I cheated on the medical law exam too

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
Be careful Tima

14
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
What did that sign back to say I missed it

15
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
I've been trying to figure out this map this way or that way I'm not quite

16
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
Sure we're headed in the right direction really where'd you find that map lying in the street

17
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
Do you know me better than that you were right beside me when I picked it up at the car rental place

18
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
You picking anything up you must have grabbed it when I went off to use the facilities

19
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:01,088
Nice names with such small print at my age it's almost impossible to read

20
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
Yeah both weapon housing and amputs housing and he's got two

21
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
That's quite a mouthful then these German names all sound like don't they they

22
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
I'm using I wonder if Germans think that about our towns when they read British Maps

23
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,688
Now we need to know when the next Crossroads coming up

24
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088
There's a pedestrian let's ask him for directions

25
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
Let's give him a ride if you ask me we're looking for trouble giving a ride to complete stranger

26
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
Maybe so oh wait a minute he's traveling with a small child

27
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,616
I feel sorry for them let's pick them up all right fine

28
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,856
Hey look 10 of those people just stopped for us

29
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
Couldn't talk

30
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,391
Sorry we don't speak German

31
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Do you understand me

32
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
Oh are you both from England

33
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,559
We're trying to get to freiheim and would really appreciate your help

34
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Could I see that map

35
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
So where is this place

36
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,751
The place you're traveling to

37
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
Oh well all right

38
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
We're around this area now so it's just a bit further south from here

39
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,575
I suppose

40
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
Duncan

41
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
You're quite an Odd Couple aren't you

42
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775
I mean I don't believe you're his father you appear to be Asian and the boys

43
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
Clearly German Caucasian yes in fact he's my best friend's son and

44
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
Some sort of well-educated professional man it's the way

45
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
I must apologize for him sorry it's not personal he just enjo

46
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,775
I was observing people now that he's retired from the police force

47
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
Nothing she just said that he used to be a cop

48
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
Let's get out of here 10 months easy so

49
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
I've been thinking I'll bet this is the first real vacation the two of you have taken since your husband retired

50
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Yes you're right my husband was such a workaholic I never truly believe we'd be able to take a big

51
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
So I'm sorry we're imposing on this time you plan to spend with your wife

52
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
We'd be happy to catch another ride if we're being a nuisance here so far the biggest nuisance has been

53
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
Getting lost cuz we can't read directions not to mention the trouble we've been having ordering food it might help

54
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
Russian mentally do I have someone like you traveling with us if only doing celebrate the bloody language

55
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
Well what should we do now de

56
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
There's nothing we can do I'm afraid

57
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,151
Except find a gas station and bring some back

58
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
Look here comes the truck

59
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,783
Hey stop hey over here

60
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
What's wrong

61
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
We're out of gas

62
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,279
That's kind of a problem out here in the middle of No Man's Land huh

63
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,655
Well I've got room for two of you in my cab

64
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,031
Is that okay somebody should take the chap up on his offer

65
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,895
Don't worry about us will be all right we'll work something out

66
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:27,391
Listen as soon as I see a gas station I'll get them to send somebody out here with a can of gas for you

67
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,743
Thank you that would be most helpful and we really appreciate it

68
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:51,455
This is great thank goodness right now everything worked out perfectly

69
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,471
How long do you think it will be before we come to a gas station

70
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
He's been quite a while now

71
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
Indeed it has my dear

72
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,191
With that nice young man let them know that we're stranded out here on the motorway

73
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
The petrol station will send someone out won't they

74
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
There is another possibility

75
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
He might just have left us and forgotten about us

76
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
I don't believe it

77
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
He's not that kind of person

78
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
He struck me as a very caring man

79
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Maybe not

80
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
What a beautiful scar

81
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
I'm not really in the mood to enjoy a sunset tonight

82
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
See one you've seen them all

83
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
Oh I'm not talking about the sunset

84
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
The sun's already disappeared

85
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,135
But just look at the lovely pastel colors the sun has left behind

86
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
It's like a watercolor painting in the sky

87
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
I wonder if Roberts watching it now

88
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
We be seeing it together

89
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,983
My goodness

90
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,639
I think it is do you better take a look my ass might be deceiving me

91
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,455
Someone's coming this way

92
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,647
It's getting bright and closer

93
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:14,047
It must be him I just knew it

94
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Couldn't find

95
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Gas station

96
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,799
Can I borrow the gas and a lamp from a farmer

97
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,663
See I told you

98
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
Oh that was a delicious meal wasn't it de

99
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,847
Thanks to your excellent translation of the German menu we were actually able to order something we could enjoy tonight

100
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Especially that one

101
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
Oh it was forcedur

102
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,063
It's from the palatnet region

103
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,879
Got liver dish was just scrumptious

104
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
The liver canoodle

105
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
That Cyrus pronounced

106
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
It melted in my mouth

107
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,399
If you hadn't been with us we'd have passed all these wonderful places without a clue as to what we were missing

108
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
I want to thank you for treating us to dinner

109
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
You're almost finished

110
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
Would you like some more to take with you

111
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,407
Thanks but if he has any more help burst

112
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
Do you think this plug looks like a criminal

113
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:15,391
For this chapter these are trial for murdering his wife and there's a big picture of him in the paper see for yourself

114
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
What's your opinion

115
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Do you think you did

116
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
Well who can tell really before I retired from the full so I was a detective with

117
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,703
Watch a long list of criminals that I put behind bars

118
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
Oh come on dear we're enjoying the evening it's really not appropriate to brag about all your past exploits

119
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Well

120
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,967
I would look at a person's face and I'd know if he'd done the crime

121
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,831
I possessed an uncanny neck for spotting the guilt that a person tries to hide

122
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
I see

123
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,927
Let's talk about something else now dear

124
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
I think you've had a little too much wine

125
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
However

126
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,583
After years on the job I couldn't tell anymore

127
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,239
Was one person good and another bad

128
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
Was he guilty or innoc

129
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
I couldn't Spot the Difference that it won't seem so clear

130
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,991
It probably means I wasn't such a hot shot detective after all

131
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
Enough said

132
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,231
Maybe I did have a little too much to drink

133
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
Tell me once more

134
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
What was the name of that wine

135
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
It was fosterone

136
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
Excellent bouquet

137
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
How cute they each

138
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
A friend

139
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:20,319
When this trip is over Dieter and you move to a new place I hope you make lots of friends

140
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Oh

141
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
Sure that'd be great

142
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
Everyone should have a happy childhood

143
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
They should enjoy every minute

144
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
It goes by so fast

145
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
Yes

146
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Oops

147
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Sorry

148
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,271
Should be somewhere right around here what are you looking for

149
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
Is the address dear

150
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Almost there

151
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,767
Sorry but we have to make a stop before continuing that's fine

152
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
Oh here we

153
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
The police

154
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:38,399
We won't be very dumb if you don't mind you might as well

155
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
Legend the car

156
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,567
What should we do tema

157
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:58,367
Let's run away

158
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:30,367
What's wrong someone's parked in one of the officers only spaces again he looks foreign

159
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:35,743
Guess I should report them

160
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
What are we going to do

161
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,847
Mr Jones

162
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
We want to get to freiheim and I don't know if you're aware of it but you're heading in the opposite direction

163
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
That's right it's just a brief detail I want to stop at Steinbach Castle

164
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:42,047
Starting by Castle or something I want to see for myself

165
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
How are you doing are you all right

166
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
Oh thank you

167
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,407
My son wrote us a letter about steinbe

168
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,759
He said the view from this Castle is truly breathtaking

169
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,575
He wanted to bring us here so we could both see it

170
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,391
Oh does your son live in Germany now

171
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
We're on our way to see

172
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,047
It's just that we have a few details to make along the way

173
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,943
This is the view he sold on that fightful day

174
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
My

175
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
My

176
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,303
I am flashing blood killed a man

177
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,887
We came to this country to visit him because he'll never leave

178
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,991
Well we'll be okay from here

179
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,575
Thank you so much for everything thank you

180
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,647
For your kindness and the pleasure of your company

181
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
Chariot

182
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,743
Look after yourself

183
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:54,655
Such a nice young man

184
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:01,055
Yes isn't he it's hard to believe that he's wanted is the prime suspect of

185
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,127
Series of murders

186
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
You must be mistaken no I'm not it's him he's on The Wanted suspects list

187
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
Impossible I'm afraid so and when we were at the station to speak to the detective of Arrested Robert

188
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,536
Those photo was prominently posted on the wall

189
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
There's so much good in him

190
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
Oh no

191
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
I thought so too and yet everyone seems convinced that he's guilty but my instincts keep

192
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
You telling me

193
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
He's an innocent man

194
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:41,248
A good in him out why is the bad I'm sure of it

195
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:46,112
It was unbelievable to think the rubber that committed murder

196
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
But he did and the fact that I couldn't sense what was going on with my own son maybe realize it was time for me

197
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:57,632
Turn in my badge

198
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:04,032
But you know something dear I just want to be able to trust my instincts again

199
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:10,432
Robert may have committed to try and true but I know he's a good boy at heart

200
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:16,832
Come on let's go in and see our son

201
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:23,232
Oh dear Robert
