00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,784
Hello sorry to bother you at this hour

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,832
We're here on Official Police business

3
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,160
Would you happen to be doctor Tenma

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,256
Can I help you pardon my asking

5
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,304
But were you home all last night

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
What

7
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
No

8
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,400
I was out drinking until dawn

9
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,728
Why do you ask well sir Eisler Memorial Hospital

10
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,848
Hospitals director heinemann chief of surgery doctor oppenheim and Dr Boyer

11
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,896
They're All Dead

12
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,128
No one except the police are allowed to enter the scene of the crime

13
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
But you're interfering with the operation of this Hospital press is not allowed inside that patience in this kind of Chaos

14
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
Can you tell us please

15
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,464
Was it an accident or was it murdered three people died at the same time of course it was murder are you part of the

16
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
Hospital staff tell us would you happen to know anything about this internet out of my way let me through hey no one

17
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
Pull out in I work here I'm Dr Kenzo Tenma come on step back so did you see

18
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,128
He wants suspicious earlier tonight I'm sorry sir but I don't think this is the time to be

19
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,040
Calm down everyone is the emergency room running smoothly well

20
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,624
Actually we're swamped with the emergency cases right now doctor

21
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
Two patients are waiting to be operated on all right then I'll see what I can do can you take care of the car accident victim with the

22
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
First I'll go look over the X-rays how about the other case the patient collapsed with a stroke

23
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Doctor

24
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,032
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions I don't have time for this

25
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,848
I understand but this initial investigation is vital

26
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,200
Do you know of anyone who could have possibly held a grudge against the director and the others

27
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
A grudge you have successfully tied The Noose around your own neck

28
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Doctor

29
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
Did someone come to mind no

30
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Sorry

31
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,584
We have a problem

32
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Those kids

33
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
The twins the boy and the girl

34
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
They're gone sir we can't find them anywhere

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,600
And is the little girl's bed empty is well nurse

36
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
What's going on what the hell is going on

37
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
In his Mercy

38
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:29,055
Atlanta hand to many who were ill and suffering we will always remember his great

39
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:35,455
Accomplishments farewell Dr Heideman may you rest in peace am

40
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
Ava I know it's difficult but please

41
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655
Try to hold your son

42
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,943
This whole funeral business is just too sad Dr tema

43
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Yeah

44
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
Up until now she was fed with a silver spoon as the director's daughter but now suddenly she's just another ordinary person

45
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:19,999
Person that's got to be quite a big shock how can you say that right now sorry about that

46
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Dr Tenma

47
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,911
I am inspector Vise Bob the nordheim westfallen police

48
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Department

49
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,495
Thank you for your efforts this was such a tragedy

50
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
Yes let me introduce you

51
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Dr Tan

52
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,175
I am inspector Lungi I'm here from the bka

53
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,247
I've heard about your amazing abilities doctor

54
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
No

55
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
I still have a long ways to go

56
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:56,607
Do you have any leads at all to the children's whereabouts no but we have determined the cause of death for the director

57
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
The other two doctors

58
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,495
We have discovered traces of nitrate inside all three of their bodies

59
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
So there were traces of nitrate

60
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
That's a muscle relaxant exactly

61
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
I see you're not a

62
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
For nothing

63
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
How could something like that end up and it was candy

64
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Candy

65
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
It turns out the same candy wrapper was found beside each of the bodies the same substance was also found

66
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
Found in each of their stomachs

67
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
Tell me

68
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,327
Would you have any idea where they might have gotten this candy

69
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
Or something else of that sort

70
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:35,007
I wouldn't know where they got it from and if you don't mind me asking how was the search for the twins going

71
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:41,407
The bka is taking over jurisdiction on this particular case from the local authorities please don't worry

72
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
As it stands after investigating certain events we believe all this could be tied back to the moment the twins parents

73
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
Shot to death

74
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,183
First their parents defect from East Germany and are murdered soon after that

75
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Then staff from the hospital where the children were treated are also murdered political terrorism may be a possibility

76
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,935
Those children might hold a major key to this whole mystery

77
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,799
They need protection please do your best to find them inspector we certainly will

78
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,383
Excuse us

79
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:22,111
Interesting a Japanese doctor demoted by the director and then his engagement at the director's daughter

80
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
Broken right before the incident

81
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,767
But the man was in the bar drinking at the time the crime was committed it checks out

82
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
Mind if I ask you something what is your hand move like that

83
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
Oh this I was just typing

84
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,151
I'm inputting all the information onto the hard drive in my head

85
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
And if I access the information

86
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
No

87
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
I still have a long ways to go

88
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:57,695
Dr Timo was actually quite modest about it when I commented on his well-recognized talents earlier

89
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
The police huh

90
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
What are they thinking you're a suspect

91
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,167
There's enough evidence to implicate me

92
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
Nothing I can do about it

93
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
I don't worry about it

94
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
They were persistent when they questioned me too

95
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
God I'm so exhausted

96
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
Once this whole thing gets settled

97
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,783
I think I'm going to go back to Japan

98
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
I came to Germany to do research but

99
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,903
With everything that's happened I see again

100
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,743
Most important thing for a doctor is to save lives

101
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Come on

102
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
Don't get all depressed on me now just tired

103
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,031
Tired

104
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
Mr Buckner

105
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
You're making great progress

106
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,711
Thank you so very much Dr Tim I'm glad to hear it

107
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,271
Do you think I'll be able to work like I used to

108
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,807
Yes of course

109
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,647
Good because if I'm not there I'll have no choice but to close shop

110
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
However

111
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
You mustn't overdo it

112
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,023
I'll stop by your restaurant for a drink after you released

113
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,583
Now that's just to make sure that you're not over working

114
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
See Dr Timmy yes

115
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
I heard that you were leaving this

116
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Hospital

117
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Is it true doctor

118
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Don't quit

119
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
Please don't quit

120
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,175
Good doctors like you are so hard to find

121
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,991
Please stay please don't say you're quitting

122
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Please

123
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
Mr book now

124
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Dr Tim

125
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
The chairman is asking for you

126
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,167
Right now he's in a meeting with the board discussing how to fill the open positions

127
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,751
Until now most of these posts were held by Dr heinemann's follow

128
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
Seems like they're going to be major changes

129
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,895
For example the rumor is Dr eckner is being transferred

130
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
I see

131
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Chapter 10 ma hold on

132
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,391
No matter what the chairman says please don't give up I want you to know we're all behind you

133
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
So please don't leave the hospital

134
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
Let me say this again

135
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
I'm performing Orient

136
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
And that's the reason

137
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
I'm making you chief of surgery

138
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
What a life

139
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,183
I went against the director's orders and lost my position as chief

140
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
And my engagement to Ava is broken

141
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,911
And then as soon as I decide to work as a regular doctor without hope of ever being promoted

142
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
Will like this is

143
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,279
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue but I'd heard you'd been appointed chief of surgery

144
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
I'm truly happy for you

145
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Thank you EV

146
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Enzo

147
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
That day at my father's funeral

148
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,799
I remember you were trying to comfort me weren't you

149
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
It made me happy

150
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,503
A lot of things happened between us but I'd like to start over

151
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Cancel

152
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,399
Listen please forgive me I was wrong let's start over

153
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
Patient is hospitalized for a spinal cord tumor

154
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
Is paralysis has accelerated

155
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,999
I understand I'll do the operation myself excellent doctor I'm glad to hear that

156
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,071
Make the arrangements for the procedure right

157
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,471
I've had it with this damn flood

158
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
I thought the world would change when the Berlin Wall came down 6 years ago

159
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
And it did

160
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
The worst

161
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
It's true

162
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,015
They talk about a unified Europe but we just keep getting dumped with the bad

163
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,367
The rate of unsolved crimes is definitely on the rise

164
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,975
Inspector we have arrived sir

165
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
Both victims had their throat slit

166
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
It isn't pretty

167
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Their identities

168
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
Mr and Mrs reichmann from Stitch Drive

169
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
They were murdered in their home

170
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
We believe they were hidden away in a Clos

171
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,383
But we're washed out to the open because of the rising flood

172
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
Another middle-aged couple murdered for GRE

173
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,063
In the past two years there have been four other similar cases across the country

174
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
All murder the same way

175
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Probably the same Thief

176
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
No

177
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
It's too premature to call these simple robberies

178
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Judging from the data

179
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,119
For some reason none of these couples seem to have had any children

180
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
Well this couple didn't seem to have any children either

181
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
Don't you think there are too many factors in common here to make the Assumption this is just a simple robbery well sir

182
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,735
I'm just going by the fact that money and goods were taken from all the victims homes it was all of it totally in a small amount

183
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,575
Although this would make sense if it were the work of a single perpetrator

184
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
Hold on you're suggesting there's more than one two of the homes in question had extremely strong locks and sophisticated

185
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Alarm systems

186
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,351
But the perpetrator bypass them and was able to enter without any trouble

187
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,447
Also none of the couple showed any signs of struggle before they were killed

188
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
And the neighbors did not hear a single sound

189
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
The time the incident

190
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Took place

191
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,639
Don't you think these were orchestrated all too well for just one suspect

192
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Yeah maybe

193
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
Do you know this man

194
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
No

195
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
Adolf Yonkers 32 years old

196
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
He's been arrested twice for larceny

197
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,439
In a robbery he's the one who Gets You Through the front door

198
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
In other words a

199
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
It turns out

200
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,863
He was spotted near the area and three of those four double murder cases

201
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
Then he's got to be the man right

202
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Or not

203
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
It's too early

204
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Well

205
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
In any case detective your job here is done

206
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
The bka will take it from here

207
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Sure

208
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Oh well

209
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
It didn't fly after all

210
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
Sorry about that I've never flown a guy before in my life it was good you almost did it well doctor do tell

211
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
How was your day last night

212
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,399
Oh well she seem like a nice girl

213
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,495
She's the daughter of a director don't tell me you just had dinner and saw her home

214
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,359
Well actually there was an emergency call during dinner so I had to come back to the hospital

215
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Hold on you did what

216
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
You'd better rethink that all work or no play doctrine you're going to lose a great catch and regret it someday do you hear me

217
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
Hey are you listening to a word I'm saying

218
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,463
Oh okay day good morning doctor how are you

219
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
Is this yours Carl

220
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
My Grandpa gave it to me

221
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,863
But it won't fly I think it's broken

222
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
Maybe the alignment needs to be adjusted

223
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,055
Well doctor do you know how to fly a kite when I was a kid back in Japan I used to do this a lot

224
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Hold it up in the air now all right

225
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
You ready

226
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
How like this had a boy

227
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Now here

228
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,367
We go

229
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,215
It's flying

230
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
All right

231
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Oh man

232
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:18,431
If I were as smooth as that I'd have at least five lovers hell maybe even 10

233
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,015
Seriously that's so awesome

234
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
Get better soon Carl

235
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,903
So that next time you can fly it yourself okay

236
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,423
Today's surgery is a paracellular meningioma extra patient

237
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,751
Will proceed with a right tyrional approach

238
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
Yes

239
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,383
Everyone watch closely the chief of surgery himself is heading up this one

240
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Brilliant operation

241
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
Just look

242
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
Get that he's hardly retracted the brain at all

243
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,807
He is truly a surgical genius

244
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,391
New residents should learn to treat the brain with such care

245
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,863
This is terrible

246
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,263
Ambulance someone calling an ambulance I didn't do it this wasn't my fault this guy ran into

247
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
The street all of a sudden out of nowhere

248
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Is this the patient

249
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Yes

250
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
How is

251
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Well

252
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
We tried

253
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
But there isn't much we can do

254
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
This man is material witness in a case

255
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,767
It's important that we get his testimony since it may help us solve a string of Serial murders doctor

256
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
Can't have him die on us

257
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
But inspector this patient isn't very critical condition

258
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,471
Really there's nothing else we can do for him here

259
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,079
However there's a top-notch neurosurgeon at Eisler Memorial Hospital

260
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
If he comes here

261
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
He might be able to do

262
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Neuros

263
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,247
That would be Dr tinma

264
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,159
Thanks for coming all the way out here Dr Tim

265
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
What's his condition right now

266
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
He is conscious but a bit delirious

267
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
Also one of his pupils is Dil

268
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
It's been a while hasn't it Dr Tenma

269
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,287
Sorry but do I know you from somewhere sir it was 9 years ago

270
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
The director's funeral remember

271
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,175
Oh yes you were from the bka inspector lunge

272
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:03,551
Please do be sure to perform a successful operation for the sake of the bka

273
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
The thing is Doctor

274
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
This patient has to survive he holds the key to solving a very important case

275
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,327
The sake of the police I do it for the sake of the patient

276
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,935
Fair enough doctor now if you'll excuse me I have an operation

277
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,543
I hear you've become the chief of surgery

278
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
Well no doctor

279
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
You certainly become very successful

280
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Yes and what about it

281
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Nothing

282
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:36,319
At your age it's quite an accomplishment aren't you next in line to become the

283
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
I still have a long way to go

284
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
Those murders years ago at Eisler Memorial Hospital due to a lack of evidence that investigation has seen

285
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Very little progress

286
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
The only clue we found

287
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Found was the poison candy

288
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,239
This suggest it was a calculated act on the part of the Killer

289
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
In that kind of crime

290
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
The killer always has something to gain

291
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
From the victim's death

292
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
What are you getting at inspector

293
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
Nothing forgive me

294
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
In my line of work

295
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,087
The mind doesn't stop I'm always thinking like this

296
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
In any case rest assured

297
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,487
Of all the cases I've ever handled throughout my career not one is gone unsolved

298
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,303
No not a single one

299
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,399
Well I'm glad to hear it

300
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
Will perform a craniotomy to remove the hematoma if we don't hurry the brain hernia will worsen

301
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,111
After the Eisler Memorial Hospital murders

302
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
No matter which way I looked at it

303
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
One person had everything to gain from the incident

304
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
And that is you

305
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Dr Tim

306
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,055
Thank you again for going to all this trouble

307
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Driving all this way

308
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:08,735
No don't worry how is the patient responding well he is still conscious but is right people does remain Dil

309
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,855
He's also got Paralysis on the left side but he has already started rehab hasn't he

310
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,903
The paralysis should go away

311
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
He's on the right

312
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,048
Listen I think the police want to interrogate him as soon as possible but that's out of the question

313
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,632
But doctor that detective Loom gay is a very persistent man

314
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,704
Right now the patients recovery is all I'm worrying about

315
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,200
How are you feeling Mr Yonkers everything okay

316
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
So

317
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
Tell me Mr Yonkers

318
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
Are you able to recognize me

319
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,904
Do you see this finger I'm holding up

320
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
How about

321
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
Can you talk to me today

322
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
What's that

323
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
I'm sorry

324
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
What did you say

325
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
Coming

326
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,016
Mr Yonkers what's coming

327
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,536
Monsters coming the monster
