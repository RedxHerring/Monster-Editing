1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
TENMA

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That was amazing!

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, he's as good as ever!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He could clip such a difficult part of the brain tumor at such a speed!

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That was a great operation, Dr. Tenma.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I've confirmed once again that Tenma Kenzo is a genius.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, it's all thanks to you all.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's already getting so hot.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
After all, it was a six-hour operation.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There's no visitors today.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Get some rest.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hey, where's Dad?

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What happened to Dad?

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Tenma, Tenma, Tenma!

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Tenma, Tenma!

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Tenma, Tenma!

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Tenma!

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hey, get up.

22
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Get up, Dr. Tenma.

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's the other way around, isn't it?

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A princess like me is supposed to wake up with a kiss.

25
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Eva, you're here.

26
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You forgot your date, didn't you, Tenzo?

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No, I didn't forget.

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't think she's asleep.

29
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hey, you can't get up.

30
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's your news.

31
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Rosenbacher's diagnosis is a ruptured cerebral artery.

32
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The operation itself went as planned.

33
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The clipping went very well.

34
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mr. Rosenbacher has a lot of fans.

35
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Is there a possibility of his recovery?

36
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes.

37
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll do my best to revive his singing voice.

38
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's a team of Dr. Heinemann who have succeeded in many difficult operations so far.

39
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
With this operation,

40
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
you can say that they have made their position in the medical world of our country unwavering again.

41
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's great, Tenzo.

42
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's not my news.

43
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's your dad's news.

44
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's true.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But that's because you had a perfect operation on your father's team last night.

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sure your father is grateful.

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You're the one who raised the reputation of the hospital.

48
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm the one who should be grateful.

49
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I can do this in Germany because of your father.

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Do your best, Tenzo.

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you follow your father, you'll be fine.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's only a matter of time before your father becomes the chairman of the hospital.

53
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Then you'll be the head of the department soon.

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You'll be the director soon.

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And I'll be the director's wife.

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Be happy.

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't like hard work.

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Do you want to go out?

59
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Or...

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Blood pressure is 128-64.

61
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Novela.

62
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm going to cut the pyramids from now on.

63
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It was still a great operation, Dr. Tenma.

64
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thank you very much.

65
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It seems that you're not only good at surgery.

66
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
At that young age, you sat in the position of the chief.

67
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The director and the head of the department are your favorites.

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And you even solved the heart of the director's daughter.

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What do you want to say, Dr. Becker?

70
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm not saying anything in a bad way.

72
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The hospital is a world of politics.

73
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You know you're being used by the director, don't you?

74
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The operation of the opera house you succeeded in.

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's like you did it yourself.

76
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a press conference on TV.

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, being used means that you have the ability.

78
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you succeed, please take care of me.

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll treat you to a drink next time.

80
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What is it?

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you Dr. Tenma?

82
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes.

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Give me back my husband.

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Give me back my husband!

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Why didn't you operate on my husband?

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You are...

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
My husband was brought to this hospital earlier.

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He was brought in before the opera house.

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But you made him a fool.

90
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You are the best doctor in this hospital.

91
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why?

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why?

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Why?

94
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
At that time, I was certainly...

95
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was about to be hit by the operation of the opera house.

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Dr. Tenma.

97
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

98
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're not here.

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Please go to the first operating room.

100
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm the director.

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Please hurry.

102
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You...

103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you had operated on me, I would have been saved.

104
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You...

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Mom!

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Give me back my husband.

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
My husband!

108
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Mom!

109
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So,

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm going to steal that dress with my friend.

111
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I only have one of that size.

112
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But don't worry.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I made it mine.

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you listening to me?

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What happened?

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I saw Karte.

118
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Dr. Becker was the one who stole the Turkish opera house.

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't want to talk about that.

120
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's obvious that it's taking too long to start the treatment.

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If I had stolen it,

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I might have been able to save the Turkish opera house.

123
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Stop it.

124
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But what am I supposed to do?

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I only did what the director told me to do.

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I only operated on that opera singer.

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm not responsible for it.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Right?

129
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Of course you are.

130
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:42,000
People's lives are not equal.

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Give it back!

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Give my husband back!

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Is that the house?

134
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yes.

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The car is nearby.

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
How many shots were fired?

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Five or six.

138
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Who lives in this house?

139
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well...

140
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's the house of Mr. Lieber,

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
who has been missing from East Germany.

142
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is going to be troublesome.

143
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll break in after I count to three.

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:56,000
One, two, three.

145
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What's going on?

146
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Someone's there!

147
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Survivors confirmed.

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
One girl.

149
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Two boys.

150
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
One girl.

151
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
One boy.

152
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
One more time.

153
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
One boy.

154
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a traffic jam.

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's an emergency.

156
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
A bullet in the head?

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Is that the only boy in the Klan family?

158
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes.

159
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
His parents died instantly.

160
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It looks like a robbery.

161
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
All right.

162
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'll be at the hospital in five minutes.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, father.

164
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm sorry, Director Heineman.

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I didn't know you were so important.

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What are you talking about, Tenma?

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Eva is your fiancée.

168
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
How is it?

169
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Would you like to have a cup of tea?

170
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Did you contact your Japanese parents on the day of the wedding?

171
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, yes.

172
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But, my father works at a small hospital.

173
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't know if I'll have time to come to Germany.

174
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's a good opportunity.

175
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why don't you enjoy your trip abroad?

176
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's right.

177
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll invite you to my house.

178
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Thank you.

179
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I owe you so much.

180
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
When I came to Germany, I thought you were a high school boy.

181
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But now, you're the youngest doctor in the Aisler Memorial Hospital.

182
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
By the way, Kenzo.

183
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Are you doing a brain hemorrhage research on the hematoma?

184
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes.

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm making a model of a dog's hematoma.

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But, that research is canceled.

187
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What?

188
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm going to announce it as a symposium at the next meeting of the European Association of Emergencies.

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I want you to organize the research.

190
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Ah...

191
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But, the research will be organized soon.

192
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But, I can't do it this afternoon.

193
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What happened, father?

194
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
A suspicious private organization came to the hospital.

195
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
They are making a fuss about the operation of the opera singer the other day.

196
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They said that they postponed the operation of the injured Turkish man who was brought in first.

197
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's a complete misunderstanding.

198
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The operation was done by the Turkish man first.

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There is no problem with our continuation.

200
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Isn't that right?

201
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes.

202
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
They are mistaken that the doctor is a volunteer or something.

203
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Before we save people's lives, we have to...

204
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Isn't that right?

205
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Anyway, I'm counting on you to organize my presentation.

206
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm expecting you, Tenma.

207
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Thank you.

208
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Huh!

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Damn it!

210
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Where is Clank?

211
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He just went inside.

212
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What's the situation?

213
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Blood pressure is 72 to 50.

214
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The pulse is 137.

215
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The bullet is from the front of the head.

216
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Take a X-ray picture immediately.

217
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yes.

218
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Ah, Dr. Tenma.

219
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Who is this girl?

220
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
She is the twin sister of the boy.

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What's her name?

222
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't know.

223
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But she seems to have a psychological shock.

224
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What is it?

225
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Kill me.

226
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Dr. Tenma.

227
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The head picture and CT scan are done.

228
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I got it. I'm going now.

229
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's from the front of the head to the center of the brain.

230
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yes.

231
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
This is difficult.

232
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What?

233
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The bullet is piercing the left ventricle.

234
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I see.

235
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Dr. Tenma is right.

236
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This is troublesome.

237
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If the bullet is moved even a little, it may explode and bleed.

238
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

239
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Dr. Becker.

240
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What are you doing so late?

241
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We will remove the skull and brain by removing the front of the head.

242
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And carefully remove the bullet.

243
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Finally, we will form a damaged blood vessel.

244
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It will take some time.

245
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Let's do our best.

246
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Blood pressure is 120 to 80.

247
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Blood pressure is 92.

248
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:15,000
He is anesthetized.

249
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Dr. Tenma.

250
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes.

251
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You are not here.

252
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Please go to the first operating room at once.

253
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Dr. Becker collapsed in a brain hemorrhage.

254
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He is heading here by helicopter.

255
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He will arrive in 10 minutes.

256
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Please contact Dr. Boyer.

257
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There is a possibility of a hemorrhage.

258
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If so, you will go.

259
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But I was just about to start the operation for that child.

260
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This is a message from the director.

261
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yes.

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
This is Tenma.

263
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, Tenma.

264
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Please take care of the mayor.

265
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I also contacted Dr. Eisen and Dr. Boyer.

266
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is perfect.

267
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But, director.

268
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I was just about to start another operation.

269
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You can leave it to Dr. Becker.

270
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I am sorry to say this.

271
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The operation we are about to start is a very difficult operation.

272
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But I am confident that I can do it.

273
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I will leave the mayor to Dr. Boyer.

274
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I can't do the operation for that child unless I go.

275
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Tenma.

276
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Please do your best to save the mayor.

277
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The mayor has promised to increase the amount of money for our hospital for the next medical examination.

278
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I can't let him die yet.

279
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm counting on you, Tenma.

280
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm counting on you.

281
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes.

282
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The mayor has arrived at the heliport.

283
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The operation will start soon after the CT scan.

284
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Please confirm the blood clot.

285
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Now, get ready, Dr. Tenma.

286
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm counting on your genius skills.

287
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I think the doctor is a volunteer.

288
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We have to save people's lives.

289
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Right?

290
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I just did the operation as the mayor ordered.

291
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I have no responsibility.

292
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Of course.

293
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
People's lives are not equal.

294
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Give it back to me.

295
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I would have been saved if you did the operation.

296
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Give it back to me.

297
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What's wrong, Dr. Tenma?

298
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I...

299
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm waiting for the operation over there.

300
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Hey, Dr. Tenma.

301
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's the director's order.

302
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The mayor is having a CT scan now.

303
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The doctor is in a hurry to the infirmary.

304
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Okay.

305
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Wait, Dr. Tenma.

306
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Dr. Tenma.

307
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's okay.

308
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hang in there.

309
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'll save you.

310
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Kill me.

311
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Kill me.

312
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Kill me.

313
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Kill me.

314
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Kill me.

315
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Kill me.

316
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Kill me.

317
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Kill me.

318
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Kill me.

319
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Kill me.

320
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Kill me.

321
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Kill me.
