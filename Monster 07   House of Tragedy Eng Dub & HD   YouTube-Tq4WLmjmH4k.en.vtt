coffee  too  you probably don't have much of an  appetite but you really should eat  you're shivering you should change out  of those wet clothes  a lot of people were dead  my brother and I were walking  it was like  they were all alone in the world  where were you when all of this happened  can you remember anything else  he crossed the  to us  and my brother said  I have a good plan  ah  soon after that  my uncle and my dear auntie were both  dead  anyone who is ever good to us died  without fail  all of them  but then one day one day I discovered  the reason why  you're talking about the incident with  Mr and Mrs Liebert  my brother did it he shot them my  brother he he murdered them  he's the one who did all this my brother  murdered them all  so I picked up the gun with both my  hands and then I I aimed it right at my  brother  and that's when he said it  he was smiling  after you shoot me make sure that you  throw the gun out the window and he told  me to aim for his head  so I I shot him like he said  I aim for his head like he told me  why did you save him  if you hadn't saved him mom and dad  would still be alive he wouldn't have  killed him  do you have to save them  stay here I'm going to the police  if those detectives last night were real  it means that some members of the police  force are linked to Johann if so we  can't just wait here like this  Nina I need you to listen to me I know  that Johan is going to come after you if  anyone comes looking for you just hide  why don't you have some food drink some  hot coffee and then try to get a couple  hours of

middle-aged  couples all that you're going to find in  this room is material for the murder at  the castle inspector long gay uh sir  please forgive me I was just a bit  curious but the crime you're  investigating and this one happened at  the same time detective I mean it  couldn't have been the same murderer so  I see  it appears that this man had been tied  up  you didn't happen to find a rope or  anything nearby did you no seems the  body had already been untied by the time  the police arrived on the scene  I see yes  there are four possible routes of Escape  From The Scene he also had to stay well  out of sight  how crowded was the area where he'd come  out and how much light was there  huh  here it is  Nina it's me Tenma I'm back  Nina you can come out now it's all right  hey Nina
